0,Jeb Bush’s Cerebral Debate Style Faces a Test: Donald Trump,"On the debate stage, Jeb Bush has committed the sin of over-explanation,
answering a pithy 1994 attack on his business career with so many details
about leases and debts that a baffled crowd erupted into boos.
He has delivered high-minded put-downs, promising in a 1998 face-off to
establish a charter school “for people that distort the facts” and mischievously
guaranteeing admission to his opponent.
And he has mangled seemingly simple sentences, vowing in a 2002
confrontation that “we can make Florida a bright — have a brighter future for
— for all Floridians.”
In a Republican presidential debate season dominated by glib
showmanship and volcanic personality, Mr. Bush, the former governor of
Florida, faces a daunting challenge: How can he excite primary voters during
Wednesday’s televised rumpus with a sober and cerebral style that can appear
tepid next to the insult-spraying, nuance-avoidant, made-for-TV manner of
Donald J. Trump?
Now, after failing to directly confront Mr. Trump, the current frontrunner,
during the first debate, Mr. Bush and his aides are under pressure to
create a memorable showdown with the real estate developer to match a newly
aggressive tone on the campaign trail.
Since the first debate, Mr. Bush has mocked Mr. Trump’s immigration
plan as “unrealistic,” released a biting online ad that captures Mr. Trump
praising Hillary Rodham Clinton and accused Mr. Trump of trying to “insult
his way to the presidency.”
In rigorous practice sessions that have crisscrossed the country in the past
few weeks, Mr. Bush has been preparing pointed responses to Mr. Trump’s
most frequent insults (he has called Mr. Bush “low energy” and a slave to
donors) and crafting lines of attack on Mr. Trump’s history of liberal
statements and unconventional policy plans, according to those who have been
told of the plans.
“He has to challenge Trump now,” said Mac Stipanovich, an adviser to Mr.
Bush during his 1994 campaign for governor who helped prepare him for
debates that year. “He has to stand toe to toe with him and call him out.”
The difficulty for Mr. Bush, who has portrayed himself as the most mature
and civil figure in the Republican presidential field, is how to inflict damage on
Mr. Trump in front of a live national audience without diminishing himself in
the process — a tricky task given Mr. Trump’s lust for the fierce counterpunch
and Mr. Bush’s disdain for memorizing sound bites.
“Jeb is a nice man. He likes people. He wants people to like him,” said
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who dominated several Republican
debates during the 2012 presidential campaign. “He is up against a barroom
brawler. And I think against barroom brawlers, if you are a nice man, you are
better off keeping your distance.”
Interviews with current and former advisers to Mr. Bush and reviews of
video footage from his debates as a candidate for governor reveal him to be a
debater with as many deficits as strengths. On stage, his mastery of policy is
almost unrivaled, but he struggles to synthesize it in compelling ways. He is
capable of telegraphing deep compassion in one moment, but can convey
unmistakable peevishness in the next. He defaults to analytical earnestness,
rarely offering flashes of humor.
For better or worse, advisers acknowledge, his brand is self-seriousness.
“His style,” said Sally Bradshaw, a top Bush campaign adviser, “is
substance.”
“His candidacy,” she added, “is not based on theatrics.”
Theatrics have failed Mr. Bush at times. During a dramatic 1994 exchange
in Tampa, he dared the sitting governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, to look into
the eyes of Mr. Bush’s business partner, who sat a few feet away in the
audience, and repeat an attack on the two men’s ethics.
“I know you don’t respect me, but I know you respect Armando Codina,”
Mr. Bush said. “Can you look him in the eye and say that we’ve done anything
wrong?”
Mr. Chiles, deploying his Southern drawl and a gift for outmaneuvering
opponents, looked toward Mr. Codina, smiled and reflected on the
businessman’s wisdom in hiring the son of an American president.
“I think,” Mr. Chiles declared, “he made a good business decision when he
took you on as a partner.”
The audience broke into loud laughter. A few days later, Mr. Bush lost the
election.
Mr. Bush has participated in about a dozen official debates since first
running for public office that year. The majority of those encounters have been
one on one with Democratic rivals, lacking the unpredictability of a crowded
stage, like Wednesday night’s forum. After losing the 1994 election to Mr.
Chiles, he prevailed in the 1998 governor’s race against Buddy MacKay, Mr.
Chiles’s lieutenant governor, and in his 2002 re-election race against Bill
McBride, a lawyer.
In many ways, Mr. Bush’s general election debates against Mr. MacKay
are a model for how he might treat Mr. Trump in the long term. Mr. MacKay
set aside his usual regal bearing and relentlessly attacked Mr. Bush as an
inexperienced, untrustworthy child of privilege. Mr. Bush’s strategy was
simple: deftly defend himself, sow doubts about his rival, but avoid excessive
confrontation to magnify Mr. MacKay’s smoldering temper.
In a 1998 debate, when he was asked about his business dealing with a
Nigerian corporation, Mr. Bush pivoted to discuss a controversial investment
that had earned Mr. MacKay $500,000. But instead of mocking it, he
suggested, generously, that there was nothing scandalous about the profit.
“I’m happy that the MacKay family made half a million bucks on a good
investment,” Mr. Bush said, “I don’t see anything wrong with that. I applaud
you for doing that.”
Mr. MacKay looked slightly dazed.
Seventeen years later, Mr. MacKay said he had miscalculated. “I expected
him to be more negative than he was,” he said in an interview last week. “I may
have been too negative myself, as a matter of fact.”
In the same debate, Mr. Bush showed unexpected humility when asked
about his relationship with Florida’s black voters, who had flocked to his
opponent four years earlier. “Republicans have ignored the black vote in this
state, and I was part of that, and it was a mistake,” Mr. Bush said.
His tendency to cram as much information as possible into an answer has
diminished since 1994, when he became entangled in a long-winded
explanation of a real estate transaction. He described a maze of leases “we had
to assume,” a debt “borrowed by an investor in the deal” and “specific
obligations.”
But the habit resurfaces now and then.
“His mind rebels against the oversimplification that passes for
succinctness in the television debate,” said Mr. Stipanovich, the 1994 adviser.
“Instinctively he finds it incomplete and unsatisfying. So he over-answers.”
As Mr. BAs Mr. Bush prepares for brawl with Mr. Trump, that 1994
debate against the wily Mr. Chiles looms larger than ever, a searing lesson
about the dangers of taking on an unpredictable opponent.
Midway through that face-off, which seemed like an agonizing draw, Mr.
Bush, the newcomer, suggested that Mr. Chiles, the incumbent, had lied to
“strike fear in the hearts of the voters.”
Mr. Chiles stood silently, resting an elbow on the lectern and taking it all
in. Then, peering over at Mr. Bush and jabbing his finger, Mr. Chiles delivered
an unscripted line about himself that changed the course of the campaign.
“I want to call attention to this old, liberal liar,” Mr. Chiles said selfmockingly,
pausing for effect. “The old he-coon walks just before the light of
day.”
The camera captured a seemingly baffled Mr. Bush looking around the
room and then toward the moderator, NBC’s Tim Russert. Neither candidate’s
aides had any idea what Mr. Chiles meant. But across the state, an entire
generation of native Floridians understood.
The he-coon is the oldest and wisest member of a raccoon pack, a cunning
hunter who knows exactly when to strike. Mr. Chiles used the old Southernism
to make it clear: He was not done being governor yet.
“Jeb was speechless,” Mr. Stipanovich recalled. “He didn’t know how to
respond.”
“At that moment,” he said, “Lawton Chiles defeated Jeb Bush.”ush prepares for a televised brawl with Mr. Trump, that 1994

0,"Carly Fiorina, Gaining in Polls, Moves to Secure Spot in 2nd G.O.P. Debate","WASHINGTON — When Carly Fiorina found herself relegated to the “undercard” for
the first Republican primary debate this month, she seized the opportunity to stand
out. Clad in a bright pink suit, the only woman in a sea of men, she delivered a
forceful performance that catapulted her into the national spotlight and generated a
bounce in public polls.
But Mrs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, wants to be on the main
stage at the second Republican debate next month. And she is waging a public war
with both CNN, which is hosting the debate, and the Republican National Committee,
which her campaign accused on Wednesday of “rigging the game” to keep her out of
the prime-time event.
CNN, which released its debate criteria in May, is planning to use an average of
public polls dating to mid-July to determine which 10 candidates will appear in the
main debate.
Because that calculation would include many surveys that were done before the
first debate, in which Mrs. Fiorina delivered a strong performance, it would not fully
capture her gains in recent polls, some of which show her near the top of the
Republican field.
Recognizing that Mrs. Fiorina may be excluded from the debate, costing her
crucial exposure and dampening fund-raising efforts, her campaign has sought to
turn the likely snub into a public relations victory in an effort to win her sympathy
and attract support from anti-establishment Republicans.
The dispute with CNN and the Republican National Committee, which awarded
the debate to the network, allows Mrs. Fiorina to emphasize her outsider status, in a
category with Donald J. Trump and the retired surgeon Ben Carson, both of whom are
winning over voters in part because they are not career politicians.
Asked about her battle over the debate criteria at a packed event in Cushing,
Iowa, on Wednesday night, Mrs. Fiorina pointedly criticized the network and the
party.
“Let’s forget that I’m a woman,” Mrs. Fiorina, who is the only female Republican
candidate, said when asked about the debate. “I’m in the top five in every state poll
and the top 10 in national polls. So what does that say about CNN and the R.N.C.?”
She continued: “I’m going to keep doing what I’ve been doing, coming out here
and talking to voters. As people get to know me, they support me. And you see that in
the polls, and you’re going to continue to see that in the polls. I’ll let CNN and the
R.N.C. decide how they look if I’m not on that stage.”
Both CNN and the Republican National Committee have said that since the rules
for the debate were released months ago, all the candidates knew the ground rules,
and it would be improper — and illegal — to change them now.
Mrs. Fiorina’s campaign nevertheless called on the committee to push CNN to
change its criteria.
“All candidates are aware of the law that the media organizations set the debate
criteria, as the candidates asked,” said Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the committee.
“CNN released its criteria over four months ago. All candidates were well aware of
what it would take to get into the two segments that CNN is hosting.”
Some Republican strategists said that Mrs. Fiorina could emerge a winner even
by losing a shot at the top-tier debate.
“Social media will light up in anger if she is consistently polling at 5 percent —
consistently in the top 10 — and ends up being denied because of a technicality,” said
Frank Luntz, a Republican political consultant and pollster. “Social media is running
this election cycle, and it’s a voice that’s outside and powerful.”
On the other hand, Mrs. Fiorina might not have stood out so much in the first
debate, in Cleveland, if she had been on the stage with the top-polling candidates at
an event that was dominated by Mr. Trump. So there may be an advantage to her to
continue to face the candidates trailing the field.
The networks themselves are grappling with how to deal with the large
Republican field. Their criteria need to be fair, but can inadvertently end up excluding
certain candidates, like Mrs. Fiorina, who could be good for ratings.
“I am sure Priebus would gladly trade Fiorina for Trump,” said John Feehery, a
Republican strategist, referring to Reince Priebus, the Republican National
Committee chairman. “CNN, of course, wants both because it maximizes the ratings.”
In retrospect, CNN’s criteria for inclusion in its debate seem intended to make it
hard for a second-tier candidate to move up to the first tier — or for a top-tier
individual to be excluded.
Unlike Fox News, which hosted the first debate and used the five most recent
national polls to determine who made the cut, CNN is using an average of national
polls released from July 16 to Sept. 10, conducted by 14 pollsters it identified as
meeting its standards.
Of the polls that qualify, nine were conducted before the first debate and only two
since then, according to the Fiorina campaign. In both of those postdebate polls, Mrs.
Fiorina was at 5 percent, up from 1 or 2 percent in polls conducted before the first
debate.
A New York Times analysis of polls that fit CNN’s criteria found that if the debate
were held today, Mrs. Fiorina would not qualify for the main stage. Not only that, but
if she were to maintain the same level of support she received in the two surveys
conducted after the first debate, she would need 10 additional qualifying polls to be
conducted before the next debate to eclipse Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is
the last candidate to be included based on his support in an average of qualifying
polls.
The Fiorina campaign is arguing that CNN should give more weight to the polls
conducted after the first debate, and it has called on the party to pressure the network
to make the change.
Some polling experts say that CNN’s formula is misguided.
“I think they did not have a pollster at the table when they decided this,” said J.
Ann Selzer, who conducts one Iowa poll. “I think it’s hard to defend, purely from a
math perspective.”
Many Republican strategists lamented the fact that Mrs. Fiorina might not make
the main debate, even as they said it would be wrong for CNN to change its selection
criteria.
Using “more recent polls makes sense,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House
speaker and a 2012 Republican presidential candidate. But, he added, “Rigging it to
help or hurt one candidate does not.”
Katie Packer Gage, a partner at Burning Glass, a firm that advises Republicans on
tailoring their messages to women, said that while Ms. Fiorina had gained a lot of
attention and had “made a real impact” on the debate in the Republican Party, she
should not receive any special treatment.
“It is unfortunate, but I don’t think the party or the network can change the rules
for any one candidate,” Ms. Packer Gage said. “What about the Hispanic candidates?
The African-American candidate? The Indian-American candidate? Should they all
have different rules? The rules were made ahead of time, and everyone knows them.”",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,New York Times,08-27-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/us/politics/carly-fiorina-gaining-in-polls-moves-to-secure-spot-in-2nd-gop-debate.html,09-29-2015
0,"Mike Huckabee Offers 6 Percent Economic Growth, and Food Tips, at Iowa State Fair","DES MOINES – As the first of more than a dozen presidential candidates to drop
by the Iowa State Fair, Mike Huckabee mixed the serious with the jovial on Thursday,
promising economic growth of 6 percent if elected president, but beginning a speech
with a culinary tip.
“Pork chop on a stick,’’ he said. “It’s what’s for lunch, dinner and a snack.’’
Mr. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, also drew laughs with a jab at
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Along with a parade of Republicans who will visit the fair
over the next 11 days, there will also be Democrats, he noted. “Hillary probably is not
going to come,’’ he said. “She’ll email in her appearances.’’
In fact, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to come to the fair on Saturday. She will not
speak at the political Soapbox on the central artery, for security reasons and, most
likely, the difficulty of managing what would be a huge crowd with potentially many
hecklers.
Donald J. Trump, for different reasons, will also avoid the relatively cozy
Soapbox stage during his expected visit on Saturday. (He is also feuding with the
editorial board of The Des Moines Register, which sponsors the Soapbox.)
Mr. Huckabee, the winner of the 2008 Iowa caucuses, who is running as an
economic populist, said 6 percent growth or more — notably upping the ante over Jeb
Bush’s promise of 4 percent growth — would be possible through what he calls the
Fair Tax, a type of national sales tax. Economists have expressed skepticism at Mr.
Bush’s promise of 4 percent growth, so Mr. Huckabee’s 6 percent plan may cause even
more raised eyebrows.
Mr. Huckabee said his Fair Tax would encourage businesses to repatriate $11
trillion that they had parked overseas and ignite a national manufacturing boom.
“Folks, it’s not enough for us to have an idea and design and create something,” he
said. “We have to make the things that we create.”
Besides delivering one more stump speech, candidates who visit the fair are able
to mingle casually with Iowans and show off a human side not always evident on the
campaign trail. People remember fondly Senator Barack Obama steering a bumper
car with one of his daughters in 2007. Less endearing that year was Fred Thompson, a
Republican candidate who strolled the fair in a pair of Gucci loafers (though Mr.
Thompson claimed the story was apocryphal).
Mr. Huckabee – he wore ostrich cowboy boots, let it be known — also visited the
Iowa Pork Tent, where he viewed a rack of sizzling pork chops just as they were lifted
from a fire. One of the cooks asked if he’d like a bite.
“Of course I do,’’ Mr. Huckabee said. “You didn’t think I came over here just to
say hi to you.’’
When his wife, Janet, sidled up, Mr. Huckabee asked, “Woman, what do you
want?’’
“Shares,’’ Mrs. Huckabee said.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,New York Times,08-13-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/13/mike-huckabee-offers-6-percent-economic-growth-and-food-tips-at-iowa-state-fair/,09-29-2015
0,"Scott Walker Ends His 2016
Presidential Run","Updated, 9:59 p.m. | Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whose early glow as a
Republican presidential contender was snuffed out with the rise of anti-establishment
rivals, announced Monday that he was quitting the race and urged some of his 15
rivals to do the same so the party could unite against the leading candidate, Donald J.
Trump.
Mr. Walker’s pointed rebuke of Mr. Trump gave powerful voice to the private
fears of many Republicans that the party risked alienating large parts of the electorate
— Hispanics, women, immigrants, veterans, and most recently, Muslims — if Mr.
Trump continued vilifying or mocking them as part of his overtures to angry and
disaffected voters.
Still, Mr. Walker’s exit was not a selfless sacrifice: He was running low on
campaign cash, sliding sharply in opinion polls, losing potential donors to rivals and
unnerving supporters with a stream of gaffes, like saying he would consider building a
wall along the Canadian border.
Appearing ashen and drained at a brief news conference late Monday in Madison,
Mr. Walker said the Republican presidential field was too focused on “how bad things
are” rather than on “how we can make them better for everyone.” Without naming
Mr. Trump, Mr. Walker issued a plea to fellow candidates to coalesce around a
different Republican who could offer a more “optimistic” vision and guide the party to
a victory next year that, he admitted with sadness in his voice, he could not achieve
himself.
“Today I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this
race so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field,” Mr.
Walker said. “With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately.
“I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the
same,” he said, “so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who
can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner.”
None of Mr. Walker’s rivals appeared poised to take him up on the suggestion of
bowing out, though they expressed surprise he was withdrawing so soon. “Holy cow,”
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Fox News.
Mr. Trump, in a Twitter post, was magnanimous: “I got to know @ScottWalker
well — he’s a very nice person and has a great future.”
Mr. Walker’s departure is likely to have little impact given the sprawling field. He
was competing most aggressively in Iowa, which he deemed a must-win state, but he
had fallen from first place to 10th in a recent poll.
And Mr. Walker’s message — a tale of conservative triumph over labor unions
and other entrenched Democratic interests in a Midwestern swing state — plainly
failed to connect. He drew support from less than one-half of 1 percent of Republican
primary voters in a recent CNN national poll.
And while Mr. Walker had built a loyal but small network of major donors,
including wealthy Republicans like Todd Ricketts — whose father founded TD
Ameritrade — he was never a force in the Republican race for money, running far
behind rivals like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Cruz.
If the demise of Mr. Walker’s campaign emphasizes anything, it is the intense
pressure that candidates are under to raise enormous sums of money not only for
their political operations but also for their “super PACs.”
Mr. Bush raised more than $100 million in the first half of 2015, providing him
with enormous resources to compete in a potentially long and costly nomination fight.
Mr. Walker helped raise about $20 million for his super PAC and $6 million more for
a related campaign committee, but Walker advisers were believed to be burning
through cash. (His campaign finances will not be made public until mid-October.)
The need to raise money has had the effect of turning the traditional state-bystate
nomination fights into national contests, in which candidates need to prove
themselves to donors across the country rather than merely win over voters in the
handful of states that hold the earliest caucuses and primaries. Mr. Walker
increasingly tailored his message for Iowans, taking some sharply conservative stands
on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage that posed problems with
moderates.
“In a different era, Governor Walker could have won the nomination if all he had
to worry about was trying to win Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and
Nevada,” said Matt Moore, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. “But
now that the presidential race has become so nationalized, so early, a candidate can
run into big trouble if they peak too early and can’t show donors and voters
everywhere that they can recapture momentum.”
As recently as this weekend, Mr. Walker was telling supporters like Mr. Ricketts
that he was committed to the race and looking for ways to save money and jump-start
his campaign after a middling performance in Wednesday’s Republican debate. But
advisers said that several factors had been weighing on him for weeks and contributed
to his decision to quit.
Mr. Walker was particularly anxious about accumulating a huge campaign debt
that he would struggle for years to pay off unless he won the Republican nomination.
Compared with Mr. Trump, Carly Fiorina and Mr. Bush, Mr. Walker is a man of
modest means: His father was a preacher and his mother was a part-time secretary,
and he has earned government salaries for most of his adult life. He was not in a
strong position to lend money to his own campaign, advisers said, nor inclined to do
so.
Yet campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they had
not been paid on time. Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said
that Mr. Walker was at a disadvantage in a large field of wealthy Republicans who had
personal, family or business connections to wealthy contributors.
“Scott Walker was a lot like the typical American in terms of personal finances —
he couldn’t write himself a big check,” Mr. Kaufmann said. “Nothing eats away at a
candidate from average means like anxieties about massive campaign debts.”
Some advisers and donors also complained that Mr. Walker’s campaign manager,
Rick Wiley, had built up a sizable organization in Madison but had devoted too little
money and staffing to crucial field operations. Mr. Wiley did not respond to requests
for comment.
Mr. Walker did start off as a particular favorite of prominent Republicans like the
billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, who both believed that Mr.
Walker was a tough, committed conservative who not only took on fights but also won
them, as shown in his success cutting taxes and hobbling labor unions in Wisconsin.
Yet if Mr. Walker’s record was inspiring, his abilities as a presidential candidate
were ultimately limited. He had verbal slip-ups almost from the start, like saying he
could defeat the Islamic State because he had won the battle against union leaders at
home. And he came across as flat and lacking in sophistication in the televised
debates.
“Scott, for whatever reason, didn’t connect on TV,” said Stan Hubbard, a
Minnesota-based television station owner and a major Walker donor. “And if you
can’t make it on television today in national politics, you’re dead.”
Robert F. List, the former Nevada governor who was chairman of Mr. Walker’s
campaign in the state, said Mr. Walker suffered especially because of the ascent of
charismatic outsider candidates, pointing to Mr. Trump, Mrs. Fiorina and Ben
Carson.
“I attribute the difficulty here to the outsiders sucking up oxygen and diluting the
support for the other candidates,” Mr. List said. He added that other campaigns had
reached out to solicit his support. “My phone,” Mr. List said, “is ringing.”",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,New York Times,09-21-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/21/scott-walker-quits-2016-presidential-race/,09-29-2015
0,"Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say ; Clinton Aides Set New Focus for Campaign","There will be no more flip jokes about her private email server. There will be no rope lines to
wall off crowds, which added to an impression of aloofness. And there will be new efforts to
bring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious.
Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her campaign for president nearly five months ago, before the
startling rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, the volcanic candidacy of Donald J. Trump and the
very public exploration of another White House run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
In extensive interviews by telephone and at their Brooklyn headquarters last week, Mrs.
Clinton’s strategists acknowledged missteps — such as their slow response to questions about
her email practices — and promised that this fall the public would see the sides of Mrs. Clinton
that are often obscured by the noise and distractions of modern campaigning.
They want to show her humor. The self-effacing kind (“The hair is real, the color isn’t,” she said
of her blond bob recently, taking note of Mr. Trump.) has played better than her sarcastic retorts,
such as when she asked if wiping a computer server was done “with a cloth.”
They want to show her heart, like the time she comforted former drug addicts in a school
meeting room in New Hampshire.
And, to soothe Democrats uneasy about her shaky poll numbers, they want her to relentlessly
contrast herself with Republicans, saying she is at her best when showing willingness to do
battle.
“The true game changer is when there’s a personified opponent,” said her communications
director, Jennifer Palmieri.
It is not clear whether any of these efforts can help Mrs. Clinton revamp her candidacy and
regain momentum amid persistent questions about her use of a private email server at the State
Department and an electorate in the early nominating states that seems increasingly captivated
by the insurgent candidacy of Mr. Sanders.
Previous attempts to introduce Mrs. Clinton’s softer side to voters have backfired amid criticism
that the efforts seemed overly poll tested. This time the strategy will compete with news
coverage on the latest developments over her email.
“The same force and energy that is giving a lift to Donald Trump is dooming Hillary Clinton, and
that is authenticity,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt
Romney. “Experience does not matter to them. What matters is you appear genuine.”
Several of Mrs. Clinton’s top strategists, speaking from a corner office at the campaign’s
Brooklyn headquarters with shabby mix-and-match chairs andexpansive views of Manhattan,
repeatedly expressed confidence about Mrs. Clinton’s standing, saying that any candidate,
Republican or Democrat, would love to trade places with her. Still, the landscape beyond does
not seem so sunny, with recent polls showing an increasing number of voters do not trust Mrs.
Clinton or believe she understands their problems.
Even as the interview unfolded, one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest advisers, Cheryl D. Mills, prepared
to be questioned by a congressional committee in Washington exploring the 2012 attacks in
Benghazi, Libya.
In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday, 45 percent of Americans said they
had a favorable impression of Mrs. Clinton and 53 percent said they viewed her unfavorably.
That is a weakening since July, when 52 percent had a positive view and 45 percent a negative
one.
Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, sought to play down the polls’ findings, saying:
“Even if you accept the ABC poll, our favorability is higher than any Republican.’’
Other changes are in store for the campaign after Labor Day. After a focus group in New
Hampshire last month revealed that voters wanted to hear directly from Mrs. Clinton about her
email practices, she has sought to offer a more contrite tone, though her detractors say she is
still too grudging. (In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said she
did not need to apologize for using a private email server. “What I did was allowed,” she said. “It
was allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that.”)
While Mrs. Clinton’s central message will remain focused on addressing income inequality and
lifting the middle class, she is scrapping the phrase “everyday Americans,” which advisers said
was confusing and did not resonate. (One compared it to the Walmart slogan, “everyday low
prices.”)
Mrs. Clinton will still evoke the joy brought into her life by her granddaughter, Charlotte, but,
given the child’s obvious advantages and privilege, will speak more broadly about building a
better future for all Americans’ children and grandchildren.
And former President Bill Clinton, who has had virtually no presence on the campaign trail, will
begin to travel the country to help with fund-raising this fall, with his first event planned for
Chicago on Sept. 17.
Democrats have expressed concern that in some ways, the often reserved former first lady,
senator and secretary of state does not seem aligned with the mood of the electorate this cycle,
with voters flocking to anti-establishment firebrands like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. Her
campaign strategists, however, believe voters’
frustration stems from a sense that Washington is not working for them and not necessarily with
the establishment.
Ms. Palmieri summed up the theme, repeating a line Mrs. Clinton had first offered last month:
“She said ‘I want to be the president who addresses the problems in the headlines and the ones
that keep you up at night.’’’
Next month contains two big tests for Mrs. Clinton. The first Democratic debate is Oct. 13,
putting her on stage alongside Mr. Sanders and other candidates eager to tangle with her. And
scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton’s private email use will intensify as she prepares to testify before the
House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22.
While many of Mrs. Clinton’s aides still contend that the issues surrounding her email are
overhyped, they also now realize the campaign was too slow to take responsibility for what
happened and explain the intricacies clearly.
“Part of this is saying we understand Americans don’t always hear all the facts, and they want to
see their candidates saying they made a mistake and being contrite,’’ said Thomas R. Nides, a
former State Department aide and friend to Mrs. Clinton.
The coming months will also be a period of trying to shed her scriptedness, which is not easy for
the policy-driven Mrs. Clinton, who in this campaign can easily be upstaged by the celebrity of
Mr. Trump and the giant crowds attracted by Mr. Sanders.
On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will appear on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,’’ a prfogram on which
she previously participated in a bowl-off against the host. She is also booked as a guest on “The
Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon, and plans to talk extensively with several nontraditional
outlets. The campaign has even tried to make the best out of the private emails released by the
State Department, saying details revealed in the messages, like Mrs. Clinton’s TV preferences
(“The Good Wife” and “Parks and Recreation”) help humanize her.
Mrs. Clinton will focus on larger events and backyard parties with supporters that allow her to
show a more informal side, aides said. Still, Democrats add, there is only so much Mrs. Clinton
can do, given her well-known political identity.
“At the end of the day, she is the establishment candidate and she just has to figure out how she
wears that,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “It’s something to navigate. You can’t
shed it.”
Asked whether Mrs. Clinton is discouraged by the setbacks she has encountered so far, her
strategists argue that the candidate, having been through her husband’s tumultuous presidential
campaigns and her own failed effort in 2008, always anticipated trying times and occasional
explosions.
“She has developed a thick skin and a very good perspective on how campaigns are going to go
and they are long, they are a hard slog and you are going to get attacked,” Ms. Palmieri said.
Whether the blueprint her strategists are preparing will be enough to overcome Mrs. Clinton’s
weaknesses is an open question. Some pollsters have pointed to a likability problem with the
former first lady, and, in presidential contests, the more likable candidate typically wins.
Still, she is optimistic about her chances and upbeat most of the time, the aides said. Since
declaring her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton has embraced a rigorous diet (when staff members set up
a mouthwatering spread of barbecue after a stop in Arkansas, she chose to eat just a single
tomato), lost significant weight and thrown herself into yoga and weight training, giving her new
energy.
Asked about the most powerful moments of the past several months, her strategists pointed to
an impromptu exchange about race with an African-American owner of a smoothie stand in
Detroit that went largely uncovered by the news media and the New Hampshire gathering with
recovering drug addicts that evolved into something of a therapy session.
“That captured the essence of her leadership style,” Mr. Mook said.
Asked about a moment they regret, Ms. Palmieri paused and then quickly settled on the rope
the campaign used to wall off reporters at a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire that
became a symbol of Mrs. Clinton’s distance from the small town celebration. A less intrusive
rope had also been used to control crowds at other events.
The Brooklyn headquarters, located on the 11th floor of a high-rise, bustled with activity heading
into the Labor Day weekend. Young people, sitting on bean bag chairs, worked on their laptops
and cellphones. Bags of Hillary-branded snacks, like beet chips, were arrayed in front of a
volunteer hall of fame collage.
Mrs. Clinton was not present. The next day, she would end what may be the last vacation she
will have for a while, to hit campaign stops in Puerto Rico, New Hampshire and Iowa. Her
favorite part of the campaign is talking to voters, her aides said.

0,Foreign policy debate fires up leaders,"OTTAWA—A foreign policy debate between the three main party leaders vying for power highlighted wide gaps over how Canada should exercise its military might, work with its main allies and play a stronger role in the world.
Staged before a live audience of 3,000 people at Toronto’s Roy Thomson Hall, it featured a combative performance by Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau who accused Conservative Leader Stephen Harper of damaging the most important foreign relationship Canada has — with the United States — because of Harper’s inability to get along with those he disagrees with.
Trudeau assailed Harper for “haranguing” the U.S. administration over foot-dragging on whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, saying Harper has narrowed the Canada-U.S. relationship down to that single issue.
“The fact is that Canadians are sitting around worried about their jobs because we have a prime minister that doesn’t like Barack Obama,” Trudeau charged in one of the sharpest exchanges of the evening.
Stung, Harper defended his record and his personal rapport with Obama.
“We have a great relationship with the U.S administration and I have a great relationship with President Obama and by the way, the Americans have never said otherwise and neither have we. This is just an invention.”
Harper said he spoke directly to Obama about the pipeline in limbo, and “he said to me there’s nothing he’s asking Canada to do; he’s going to make that decision based on his own assessment of American interests.”
But the debate — the fourth of the campaign so far — largely turned into a bitter struggle between the Liberals and NDP over who is the most likely agent of change from the Conservatives, with New Democrat Leader Tom Mulcair trying to strike a contrast every chance he got.
The evening kicked off with a sharp Harper-Mulcair duel over when Canada should deploy its armed forces if not against a brutal foe like the so-called Islamic State — a duel that soon developed into a three-way fight.
Mulcair said it was not a multilateral effort led by the United Nations or Canada’s NATO allies unlike the mission in Libya which the NDP backed. “We understand that there will be times when we have to, either under the NATO charter or under our international obligations at the UN, use force,” Mulcair said. “We won’t shy away from that.”
Harper retorted that although not a NATO-led mission, all Canada’s NATO partners support the fight against ISIS, and suggested his political rivals are naive. Canada still participates in peacekeeping around the world, but there “is not a peacekeeping mission to be had right now in Iraq and Syria” against the fundamentalist Islamist militias of ISIS, said Harper.
“Why we would abandon this mission is a question that goes begging.”
The battle between Trudeau and Mulcair to define themselves as the leader with the policies most in line with Canadian values and traditions crystallized in fierce exchanges over the Liberals’ support for controversial anti-terrorism amendments the Conservatives enacted in Bill C-51.
Mulcair savaged Trudeau, repeatedly suggesting the Liberal leader lacked political courage. He said the NDP is the only party that voted for Canadians’ freedoms and liberties against overarching state surveillance.
“I’m not afraid of Stephen Harper, I voted against C-51,” he said to Trudeau.
Trudeau accused Mulcair of “stoking fear” in Canadians by suggesting that Canada is turning into a police state, with their rights being taken away.
The debate canvassed a range of issues with all leaders getting in sharp, partisan and sometimes personal jabs about issues from Arctic sovereignty, Russia’s occupation of Crimea in Ukraine, and Canada’s relationship with its main ally, the United States.
Trudeau scoffed at Harper’s claim to have defended Arctic sovereignty. “The one thing they keep saying about you up there Mr. Harper is you’re big sled, no dogs.”
Yet it was over Canada’s relationship to the U.S. that the three leaders clashed over climate change, trade and the American administration’s seeming reluctance to approve the Keystone XL pipeline proposal.
Harper said his government has worked “with two radically different administrations in the U.S.” under Republican and Democratic leaders, and worked “productively with both.”
“
At another point, Trudeau and Harper clashed sharply over the Conservatives’ decision to revoke the citizenship of an Islamic extremist who masterminded a plot to bomb downtown Toronto.
Harper defended the decision to strip citizenship from Zakaria Amara, saying, “A few blocks from here, (he) would have detonated bombs that would have been on a scale of 9-11. This country has every right to revoke the citizenship of an individual like that.”
Trudeau said the man “should be in jail” but, “We have a rule of law in this country and you can’t take away citizenship because you don’t like what someone does.”
Trudeau challenged Harper’s claim to have acted on climate change, saying that in the face of federal “inaction,” provinces took action themselves, such as when Ontario shut down the province’s coal plants.
Although Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was not invited to participate in the Munk Debate, she posted video responses to the questions on Twitter. Many of her answers, including on the Arctic and the Islamic State, referred to climate change as one of the greatest threats posed to Canada and the world.

0,Harper’s Conservatives slide in public support in new poll,"AMHERST, N.S.—Stephen Harper’s Conservatives have taken a tumble in public support, new poll results reveal.
New polling released Monday night has the NDP on top with 33 per cent, the Liberals in second at 31 per cent and the Tories down to 26 per cent.
According to pollster Nik Nanos, the NDP have gained three points in the past month. The Liberals are up as well, jumping two points. However, the Tories have slid to third, dropping five points and losing their front-runner status.
Through the first half of this marathon election campaign, the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats had been tightly bunched in public support. But this most recent poll, done for the Globe and Mail and CTV News, shows the NDP and Liberals cementing their support at the expense of the Conservatives.
Though the Oct. 19 election day remains more than a month away, the new numbers will be jarring for the Conservatives. When Harper launched the campaign in early August — making it one of the country’s longest and costliest elections in history — he declared at the time that the economy and national security were the central issues facing Canadian voters.
Since then, his party struggled to get its message out as unexpected momentum-draining events batter it.
They started with damning revelations at the trial of former Conservative senator Mike Duffy that raised fresh questions about the involvement of Harper’s inner circle in the secret $90,000 payment to the senator.
Then new data confirming the Canadian economy was in a recession for the first half of 2015 undercut the Tory messaging on the economy.
Last week the migrant crisis in Europe was driven home by the worldwide circulation of photos of the tragic death of a young Syrian boy whose family had sought to come to Canada.
That put the spotlight on whether the Conservative government was doing enough to assist with the crisis and put Immigration Minister Chris Alexander in the hot seat.
Now it seems some of those headlines are starting to take their toll on Harper and his party as they endeavour to win a rare fourth mandate.
In Ontario, the polling has the Liberals ahead with 38 per cent, the Conservatives second with 32 per cent and the New Democrats in third with 25 per cent.
The survey results are based on a three-day rolling average of 1,200 voters, surveyed between Sept. 4 and 6.

0,Party leaders’ response to Syrian refugee crisis reveals stark differences,"OTTAWA—The Syrian refugee crisis dominated the federal election campaign trail Friday, as party-leaders traded barbs over whose approach is wrong-headed and endangers lives.
Stark differences emerged over the best approach to dealing with the human tide of refugees fleeing violence in Syria.
Conservative leader Stephen Harper slammed the other parties, aiming most of his criticism at NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, saying he has adopted a “totally irresponsible position” in suggesting “we can resolve this crisis just with refugee policy.”
Harper argued a three-prong approach is required: increasing the intake of refugees from the region, supplying humanitarian aid on the ground, and offering military support to fight Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
“Anything else is inadequate and is a cop-out and this country will not do it,” Harper said, to loud applause from party supporters in Whitehorse.
Earlier, the NDP leader dismissed Harper’s claim that military action is key. Mulcair insisted Canada has the resources to start processing 10,000 Syrian refugees “before the end of this year,” something the NDP platform promises to do.
NDP leader Thomas Mulcair pointed out that military action would not have saved the life of Alan Kurdi, 3, ""that poor boy on the beach.”

“We have the means to do that. We’ve proven it in the past [that] when we want to do something we can do it,” Mulcair said at a campaign event in Brossard, Que., on Friday.
“But military action would not have saved the life of that poor boy on the beach.”
Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau said Thursday that “Canada must immediately accept 25,000 Syrian refugees, stop dragging its heels.”
There are few details about how that plan should work. But, on Friday, Trudeau told reporters in Richmond Hill that what it takes is “simply political will.”
“We have done that in the past in moments of crisis. We can do that again.”
All three party leaders, Harper, Mulcair and Trudeau have expressed their sorrow at both the images of the lifeless body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy on a Turkish beach and the mourning of his Canadian family in Coquitlam, B.C.
The governing Conservative party insisting that along with humanitarian aid and refugee policy, engagement in the military campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is a crucial to resolving the problem and to protecting Canada’s own security.
“We also have to do something about the root cause,” said Harper.
“The NDP’s position on these things is deeply ideological, and it is deeply wrong and it is out of step with what Canadians believe.”
However the Conservative government, which refugee advocacy groups suggest relies more heavily on private sponsorship of refugees than government-sponsorships, appears to have narrowed its focus to Kurdish Yazidis and Christian refugees fleeing persecution in the region.
Harper’s immigration minister Chris Alexander says the Conservative government, if re-elected, would allow in an “additional 10,000 persecuted ethnic and religious minorities from the region.”
Harper said Friday his approach is not based on a belief that Syrian refugees are a security threat, but he said “there are issues of fairness.
“You want to make sure that of all the millions that could apply you’re bringing in the most vulnerable.
“Also this is a war zone so there are security things that have to be checked.”
The Conservatives’ proposed increase of 10,000 refugees would apply to Syrians and Iraqis, not just those from Syria where the population is fleeing both a brutal dictator in Bashar Assad, and the brutally violent insurgent Islamist group known as Islamic State, ISIL or ISIS, which is trying to claim territory for a fundamentalist Islamist state.
The NDP has targeted Syrian refugees in its plan.
It promises to “get 10,000 government-sponsored refugees out of harm’s way and on the way to Canada by the end of this year by appointing a Syrian Refugee Coordinator, pulling resources from various departments, including Foreign Affairs, Citizenship and Immigration and other departments.”
It calls for: boosting the presence of Canadian diplomatic and immigration officials in the region to accelerate processing of refugees; coordination with Turkey and other affected countries “to remove bureaucratic obstacles to resettlement,” and for treating “all refugees equally.”
The NDP, too, embraces private sponsorship of refugees, and promises to fast-track private sponsorship with no cap “to bring as many people as possible to Canada.” Mulcair says he will increase aid to humanitarian-assistance agencies, including the UNHCR, “based on the needs on the ground.”
Conservative Leader Harper, seeking a fourth term as prime minister, acknowledged Friday cases have to be processed more quickly.
“Look, we realize we have to bring in more and we have to do it more effectively and quickly.”
But he gave no indication how much money he could commit to streamline the processing of applicants.
The Conservative record is facing tougher scrutiny after news that the Kurdi family had relatives in B.C. who were trying to bring the extended family to safety both in Canada and Europe.
The Harper government had set a target for Canada to accept 23,000 Iraqi refugees and 11,300 Syrians. Of that number, Canada has already resettled nearly 22,000 Iraqis. Just 2,300 Syrians have arrived.
Harper says the Conservative promises to accept 10,000 more from the region, spread over three years, are more generous than pledges made by other Western countries.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Toronto Star,09-04-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/04/parties-responses-to-refugee-crisis-show-stark-differences.html,09-30-2015
0,Elections Canada warns of U.S.-style ‘voter suppression tricks’,"OTTAWA—Elections Canada has quietly warned staff to be on the lookout for increasingly sophisticated tactics aimed at discouraging — or even stopping — voters from casting a ballot.
The advanced voter suppression techniques flourishing in the United States are likely to spill into other countries, employees were advised in a presentation aimed at raising awareness prior to the Oct. 19 federal election.
The digital revolution has fuelled intensive data analysis south of the border that allows political parties to zero in on people who support rival candidates and then find ways to prevent them from voting.
The development prompted Elections Canada to comb through academic papers and media reports and talk to experts and lawyers about the phenomenon of electoral malpractice.
“It’s important for us to identify potential risks in order to be prepared to detect and respond to incidents that may occur, including incidents that could compromise the integrity of the election,” said Elections Canada spokesman John Enright.
A copy of the May 2014 presentation, “An Introduction to Emerging Trends and Threats in Electoral Operations,” was released to The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
It was prepared just months before Conservative campaign worker Michael Sona was convicted of taking part in a scheme to misdirect voters in Guelph, Ont., to phoney poll locations during the 2011 campaign.
The research revealed that rough-and-tumble American political campaigns are the seedbeds of such behaviour — identifying 17 cases in 15 states from 2004 through 2012.
“We need look no further than the United States to find a vast overview of contemporary voter suppression and surveillance practices,” the presentation notes say.
Elections Canada cites four stages of a successful voter suppression plan:
Identify non-supporters;
Gather information on them;
Prevent them from going to the polls through scare tactics, misinformation or systematic challenging of registrations;
If electors get to the polls, prevent them from voting by contesting eligibility or identification, and through intimidation.
Eleven years ago, one party took the fairly broad-brush approach of assuming students at a historically black college in Florida would not be supporters, the presentation points out. The party then systematically challenged the eligibility of voters on that list, resulting in long poll lineups and delays.
But today the same computer software that allows parties to build massive databases with detailed information about likely supporters also enables them to more precisely identify — and target — non-supporters.
Parties use voter lists, digital maps, and information from public or commercial sources to build personal profiles — each containing up to 250 pieces of data, from basic demographic information to culinary or musical tastes.
“These databases allow campaigns to send micro-targeted messages to specific audiences,” the notes say.
For instance, Spanish-speaking voters in Arizona received robocalls and mailouts in 2012 advising them to vote after election day.
In Maryland, tens of thousands of Democratic voters were apparently targeted by robocalls in 2010 falsely saying their candidate had already won the election.
The U.S. has also seen the rise of “poll watchers” recruited by activist groups, the notes say. “They often harass voters in predominantly minority voting districts, create anxiety and agitate voters.”
Another tactic involves handing out flyers threatening jail time or other penalties for those who vote “illegally” — a means of dissuading those who are unsure of their registration status or whether they have the correct identification.
A multi-party parliamentary system like Canada’s may be especially affected by such micro-targeting, which tends to “consolidate power in the larger, more well financed political parties” at the expense of smaller ones, the Elections Canada notes say.
In addition, micro-targeting can have a “disproportionate impact” on parliamentary systems, where subtle shifts in voter behaviour of specific slivers of the electorate in key electoral districts “can indeed affect the distribution of seats in the legislature and even the composition of the government.”",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Toronto Star,09-21-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/21/elections-canada-warns-of-us-style-voter-suppression-tricks.html,09-30-2015
0,"Ready or not, TV spots launch new round in federal campaign’s ‘air war’","OTTAWA—The longest election campaign in modern Canadian history hits the midway point this week and political parties are ramping up their advertising wars.
Under new changes brought in last year by the Conservative government, campaign spending limits increase with the length of the writ period, meaning a party with a full slate of 338 candidates this year can spend almost $54.5 million.
According to Elections Canada returns, the big three national parties spent between 39 and 50 per cent of their 2011 election campaign budgets on TV and radio advertising — a combined total of $28 million, not including “local” ads by individual candidates, who have their own spending limits.
If the same proportions hold true this year, the Conservative, New Democrat and Liberal national parties could pour an unprecedented $20 to $30 million each into their respective air wars, plus millions more in regional ads by local candidates.
All that ad spending is not evenly spread over the length of a campaign. Parties tend to go heavy in the first week as each tries to establish the ballot question, ramp up again around the major televised leaders’ debates and then go all out over the final 10 days, when voters are firming up their choices.
This year’s 11-week campaign — from Aug. 2, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked that Parliament be dissolved, to election day Oct. 19 — has introduced a new advertising dynamic. So has the unusual three-way race that has the NDP, Liberals and Conservatives all within hailing distance of one another.
Political parties don’t divulge their media buy strategies, and many advertisements that are floated in party announcements never actually air on TV. However, given the increasing importance of web viewership, the once-clear distinction between ads that merit a TV buy and those that only run online is blurring.
“Advertising is a window to the campaign,” Jason Lietaer, the president of Enterprise Canada who ran the Conservative campaign “war room” in the 2011 election, wrote in a blog post this week.
“There’s lots of ways to figure out where the parties think they stand, but they pay a lot of attention to advertising. It’s where the real money is spent and it has the potential to move a larger number of votes more quickly than any other medium.”
Here’s a look at the state of play in the ad wars through the first five weeks of the 78-day campaign: 
Conservatives: The deep-pocketed governing party has been blanketing the airwaves with ads attacking Justin Trudeau since last May, long before the official campaign began.
“The Interview” series, in which actors pretend to examine Trudeau’s resumé before declaring him “just not ready,” was a fixture throughout August on everything from news channels and sports networks to specialty channels such as Discovery and the Space Channel, according to sightings posted on social media.
The Conservative party has aired at least five different versions of “The Interview,” focusing on different issues and claims about Trudeau’s platform. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair gets the treatment in one version.
Harper, with a nine-year record to run on, has been largely absent from the Conservative ad campaign so far. A new English-language Conservative ad features actors talking about the leadership options and ends with a white-haired woman earnestly stating: “Stephen Harper isn’t perfect, but when it comes to the economy we can depend on him.” A new French-language ad being shopped by the party this week paints Tom Mulcair’s NDP as “too risky.”

New Democratic Party: The NDP has been leading in national public opinion polls since the official campaign began and have coasted on that front-runner status with an almost non-existent media buy until this week, presumably mustering their resources for a big push later in the campaign when they hope to seal the deal.
A new, soft-focus NDP ad narrated by Mulcair is going into paid circulation this week, while a hard-hitting attack ad targeting a list of Harper appointees in legal difficulties generated plenty of online buzz and earned media but did not appear to be the subject of a significant media buy.
Liberals: The Liberals under Trudeau have faced paid Conservative attack ads literally since the day Trudeau was chosen party leader in April 2013. The barrage only intensified with the start of the election campaign last month and the Liberals responded with a paid election ad that appeared to break one of the cardinal rules of politics: it repeated the language of an opponent’s criticisms.
Nonetheless, the ad with Trudeau declaring himself “ready” to govern appears to have received a significant financial push, appearing everywhere from NASCAR, baseball, soccer, Canadian Football League and NFL preseason telecasts to the Food Network and at least one episode of Citytv’s “Bachelor in Paradise.”
A more recent ad featuring Trudeau talking about the economy while on an escalator is also getting paid air time, according to social media sightings.
Mocking the Tories mocking of him, Justin Trudeau says in one Liberal ad, ""I'll tell you what I'm not ready for,"" mentioning recession and job losses.

Green party: There’s no evidence that Elizabeth May’s Green party is running any paid national advertising yet, but the party did get a minor earned media coup with the release of an online campaign ad featuring Green candidate and former CBC meteorologist Claire Martin reprising her TV persona with a “political” forecast.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Toronto Star,09-10-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/09/10/ready-or-not-tv-spots-launch-new-round-in-federal-campaigns-air-war.html,09-30-2015
0,"Obama Condemns ‘Routine’ of Mass Shootings, Says U.S. Has Become Numb","WASHINGTON — President Obama’s rage about gun massacres, building for
years, spilled out Thursday night as he acknowledged his own powerlessness to
prevent another tragedy and pleaded with voters to force change themselves.
“So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little
closer are thinking about the families who aren’t so fortunate,” the president
said in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named for a man severely
wounded by a would-be assassin’s bullet, “I’d ask the American people to think
about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these
lives and let these people grow up.”
Mr. Obama admitted that he was unable to do anything to prevent such
tragedies by himself. And he did little to try to hide the anger and frustration
that have deepened as he returns again and again to the White House lectern
in the wake of a deadly mass shooting.
Mr. Obama took a veiled swipe at the National Rifle Association, which
has successfully fought most limits on gun use and manufacture and has
pushed through legislation in many states making gun ownership far easier.
“And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners who are using those guns
properly, safely, to hunt for sport, for protecting their families, to think about
whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that
suggests it is speaking for you,” he said.
Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to respond to
Mr. Obama, saying that it was the organization’s policy “not to comment until
all the facts are known.” Wayne LaPierre, the organization’s executive vice
president, declared after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., “The only
thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”
On Thursday night, Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass
shootings, people had “become numb to this.”
“And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who
oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” Mr. Obama said. “Right
now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ‘We need more guns,’
they’ll argue. ‘Fewer gun-safety laws.’ ”
“Does anybody really believe that?” he asked, his voice rising.
Mr. Obama sought to answer that question years ago. After the massacre
in 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislative
changes that polls suggest were widely supported.
“Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such
carnage, that the politics are too hard?” Mr. Obama asked then.
Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul the
nation’s gun laws that would have included universal background checks and a
spate of other measures he deemed “concrete steps” aimed at preventing more
mass shootings.
“This is how we will be judged,” he said in January 2013.
The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from both
parties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president’s gun control
agenda. At the time, and also visibly upset, Mr. Obama stood in the Rose
Garden to denounce the opponents of new gun measures even as he
acknowledged the futility of his efforts.
He called it a “shameful day” in Washington and promised that eventually,
“I believe we’re going to be able to get this done.” In a Twitter message on
Thursday, Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama until this year,
remembered that afternoon as “the most frustrated I ever saw President
Obama in 8 years.”
With each massacre since, Mr. Obama has been forced to help the country
grieve, as presidents are called upon to do in national tragedies. Thirteen dead
at the Washington Navy Yard; three dead at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex.; nine
dead in a church in Charleston, S.C.
And with each massacre, his sense of powerless anger and frustration has
built.
But what was different this time was that the president did not announce
any new initiative or effort to fix the problem. Instead, he pointed out that
there is “a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how
can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us
safer?”
States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths than
those that do not, he said. “So we know there are ways to prevent it,” he said.
He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters by
insisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety,
and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts.
But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federal
government even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notion
that the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons.
He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed
by terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the number
killed by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions of
dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively few
terrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far
greater number of gun deaths.
And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority.
“If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected
officials to reflect your views,” he said.
Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant. His
speeches since being elected in 2008 have sometimes seemed like lectures
from the constitutional law professor he once was. But he is also a father, one
who insists on eating dinner with his daughters.
Shootings, particularly at schools, have seemingly brought together his
roles as president and father in ways nothing else has. And that combination
brings forth the kind of raw emotion he almost never betrays.
His eulogy in June for the victims of the massacre in Charleston, for
instance, was widely considered one of his most impassioned, and included
singing the opening refrain of “Amazing Grace.”
Thursday night, he had little of the soaring language and certainly none of
the hope he expressed in Charleston. But he promised to continue hammering
away at this issue for the rest of his presidency.
“Each time this happens, I’m going to bring this up,” he said. “Each time
this happens, I’m going to say that we can actually do something about it.”

0,Gun Control Voices in Congress All but Silent After Charleston Shooting,"WASHINGTON — After the fatal shootings at a landmark black church in
Charleston, S.C., Senator Joe Manchin III, who sponsored gun safety
legislation that failed in Congress two years ago, released a statement
lamenting “the nine souls who were lost.”
One word the West Virginia Democrat did not use was guns.
Neither did the Twitter message of Representative Mike Thompson,
Democrat of California and the head of the House Gun Violence Prevention
Task Force. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the liberal minority
leader, visibly shaken, said nothing about guns on Thursday morning. Nor did
Senator Patrick J. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who was the coauthor
of Mr. Manchin’s legislation.
Two and a half years after the massacre of 20 children at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., galvanized some lawmakers to seek
modest gun control legislation, the prospects now are even more remote.
Lawmakers, weary from the emotional fight and ultimate failure to get a
bill to enhance background checks for gun sales off the Senate floor two years
ago, seem resigned to the view that if 20 small children killed at a school
cannot move Congress, then nine black men and women shot dead by a white
man during Bible study will not, either.
That reality was summed up by President Obama — tired from his
multiple mournful treks to his lectern speaking of gun deaths — on Thursday
afternoon. But recognizing that he sounded more resigned then than he
intended, Mr. Obama on Friday offered a more vigorous call for gun control
during a speech in San Francisco.
“If Congress had passed some common-sense gun safety reforms after
Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own
classroom — reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported — we
wouldn’t have prevented every act of violence, or even most,” Mr. Obama said.
“We don’t know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston. No
reform can guarantee the elimination of violence. But we might still have some
more Americans with us.”
Mr. Obama added: “You don’t see murder on this kind of scale with this
kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on earth. Every country has
violent, hateful or mentally unstable people. What’s different is not every
country is awash with easily accessible guns. And so I refuse to act as if this is
the new normal.”
But the reality is closer to Mr. Obama’s initial comments at the White
House on Thursday, when he said that today’s “politics in this town foreclose a
lot of those avenues right now.”
A variety of factors make this so. Since the 2012 shootings in Newtown,
Congress has added more pro-gun lawmakers to its ranks. Although roughly a
dozen states have passed major gun control legislation in the intervening
years, even more have loosened gun restrictions. Mr. Obama, who convened
his top aides in the Oval Office the night of the Newtown shootings to discuss
pushing for new gun laws, has put far more muscle into legislation where he
can find common ground with Republicans — like his trade package currently
before Congress — than face further frustration.
The issue of gun violence has also been overshadowed by a focus on the
nation’s racial tensions after a series of killings of unarmed black men by the
police — and underscored by what appear to be the racist motivations of the
man charged in the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Charleston on Wednesday night.
Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a presidential
candidate who has supported control legislation in the past, canceled a
campaign stop planned for Sunday and issued a statement saying, “The
Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that
still taints our nation.”
In Charleston on Thursday, a half-block from the church where the
shootings occurred, Jack Logan unfurled a banner that read, “Put Down the
Guns, Young People.” Jareem Brady, 42, stood talking animatedly next to Mr.
Logan’s banner, but said that racial discrimination was a bigger issue than
guns. “That’s what this is about,” he said.
The silence is frustrating to some lawmakers. “Justified or not, there has
traditionally been a reluctance to talk about policy in the 24 hours after a
massive tragedy,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of
Connecticut, who continues to advocate gun legislation. “I really believe that
our silence is making us complicit in these murders.”
Americans have sent mixed messages on guns.
A Pew survey last year showed that 52 percent of Americans said they
thought it was important to protect gun ownership rights. That figure was up
from 29 percent in 2000. In a 2013 poll, Pew found that nearly 75 percent of
respondents supported expansion of background checks, which has been the
focus of much federal and state legislation.
Still, more, not fewer, guns is the solution many state lawmakers and the
National Rifle Association are pushing to combat violent episodes. On a
firearms Internet forum this week, an N.R.A. board member, Charles Cotton,
indirectly blamed Emanuel A.M.E.’s pastor, Clementa C. Pinckney, for his own
violent death, by criticizing Mr. Pinckney’s votes as a South Carolina state
senator against proposals that would allow gun owners to conceal their
weapons when they carry them in public.
“Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly
allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead,” Mr. Cotton wrote.
Mr. Murphy recently introduced legislation to help states develop
licensing programs similar to Connecticut’s relatively new handgun purchasing
law, which helps prevent those who would not pass a background check from
buying guns.
Mr. Thompson, the California Democrat, said he was waiting to address
guns publicly: “I think it is important to pay respect to the victims.” He added,
“I will never stop working on gun issues.”
But most lawmakers have turned to mental health legislation, including
Senator Murphy, who is working with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of
Louisiana, on a bill to overhaul the nation’s mental health programs. Both men
have also teamed up with Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of
Pennsylvania, who just introduced a mental health bill of his own, an area
where there will likely be broad, bipartisan support in Congress.
“There have been too many days since December 2012 that have brought
that sinking feeling back to my stomach,” Senator Murphy said. He added: “I
never feel lonely on issues related to gun violence because 90 percent of the
American people agree with me and the vast majority of gun owners want the
kind of reform that failed in the Senate two years ago. There is a reckoning. I
just can’t tell you how we get there.”

0,Texas Lawmakers Pass a Bill Allowing Guns at Colleges,"HOUSTON — Students and faculty members at public and private universities
in Texas could be allowed to carry concealed handguns into classrooms,
dormitories and other buildings under a bill passed over the weekend by the
Republican-dominated Legislature. The measure is being hailed as a victory by
gun rights advocates and criticized by many students and professors as
irresponsible and unnecessary.
The so-called campus-carry bill is expected to be signed into law by the
Republican governor, Greg Abbott. It would take effect in August 2016 at
universities and August 2017 at community colleges.
Supporters say it will make college campuses safer by not preventing
licensed gun owners from defending themselves and possibly saving lives
should a mass shooting occur, such as the one that unfolded at Virginia Tech
University in 2007.
Opponents say the notion that armed students would make a campus safer
is an illusion that will have a chilling effect on campus life. Professors said they
worry about inviting a student into their offices to talk about a failing grade if
they think that student is armed. And Democratic lawmakers and some
university leaders worry about increased security costs and the bill’s effect on
recruiting potential teachers and students from other states.
“The perception in academia will be that Texas is a free-fire zone with
yokels in the classrooms packing heat,” said Lynn W. Tatum, a professor at
Baylor University in Waco and the former president of the Texas conference of
the American Association of University Professors.
Texas will be one of eight states to allow the carrying of concealed
weapons on public college campuses, joining Colorado, Idaho, Kansas,
Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures. Nineteen others ban concealed weapons on
campus, including California, Florida and New York, and 23 others, including
Alabama and Arizona, leave the decision to the colleges or state board of
regents.
The bill that passed in Texas was something of a compromise that allows
private universities to opt out and public ones to designate parts of their
campuses as gun-free zones. But coming at a time when legislatures have
allowed guns at places from bars to houses of worship, it reflects the seemingly
limitless legislative clout of gun interests, particularly in Republicandominated
states.
One of the most prominent opponents of the campus-carry bill was an
unlikely figure — a former member of the Navy SEALs. Adm. William H.
McRaven, the former commander of United States Special Operations forces
who directed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, is now the chancellor of the
15-campus University of Texas System.
“I’m a guy that loves my guns,” Admiral McRaven said. “I have all sorts of
guns. I just don’t think bringing guns on campus is going to make us any safer.
If you’ve ever been shot at, which I have, then you have an appreciation for
what a gun can do.”
In addition to the campus-carry bill, Republican lawmakers also approved
an open-carry bill, which gives those licensed to have a concealed weapon the
option of carrying it openly in a holster, although open carry will not be
allowed on a college campus. The debate over both bills made gun rights a
dominant issue of the legislative session.
One of the bill’s chief architects was Senator Brian Birdwell, a Republican
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel wounded in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on
the Pentagon. Those backing it included local and national gun rights groups,
including Students for Concealed Carry and the state affiliate of the National
Rifle Association; Tea Party activists; and Sheriff Parnell McNamara of
McLennan County, which includes Waco. Other law enforcement officials
testified against the bill, including Adrian Garcia, who at the time was the
sheriff of Harris County, which includes Houston.
Supporters said that because Texans licensed to have concealed firearms
must be 21 years or older, the number of the state’s 850,000 license holders
who will ultimately carry on campus will be small, and will most likely be older
community college students more interested in protecting themselves as they
walk to their cars at night on campus than in carrying their weapons to a
fraternity party.
“An armed society is a safe society, so any time you have gun control, there
is far more opportunity to become victims,” said State Representative
Jonathan Stickland, a Republican and Tea Party favorite who often does his
legislative work at the Capitol wearing his concealed .40-caliber semiautomatic
pistol. “The criminals aren’t going to obey the laws. It’s the responsible folks
who we should be encouraging to protect themselves in the community they
live in.”
At the University of Texas at Austin, interviews with more than a dozen
students Tuesday found little support for campus carry. The university was the
scene of the nation’s first campus mass shooting on Aug. 1, 1966, when a
sniper, Charles Whitman, fired at people from the school’s clock tower in a day
of violence that left 16 people dead. The campus-carry law will take effect there
Aug. 1, 2016, exactly 50 years later.
“I don’t think guns should be allowed, because that’s pretty scary,” said
Sarah Wang, 18, a computer science major and sophomore who stood near the
tower. “We’ve already seen so many instances where people get hurt because
there are guns in schools.”
In some ways, the legislative battle over the bill was symbolic. For years,
Texans who were licensed by the state to carry a concealed firearm had never
been prohibited under the law from walking on or through the grounds of most
college campuses with their weapon. The bill gives those licensed to carry a
concealed firearm the right to have their firearms while they are inside
buildings and clarifies that they can be armed while on campus, although
several caveats pushed by Democratic lawmakers will dampen the impact of
the legislation.
The bill gives private and independent colleges the option of opting out
entirely. Public colleges have no such option, but lawmakers allowed university
presidents at public institutions to come up with concealed-weapons
regulations that could let them establish gun-free zones on their campuses.
The bill says university officials can establish “reasonable rules,” but states
those regulations cannot “generally prohibit” license holders from carrying
concealed handguns on campus.
“While the passage of campus carry is disappointing, the legislation is
better than it could have been in that we will be able to exercise some local
control,” said Neal J. Smatresk, president of the University of North Texas, a
public institution in Denton. “We need to review the legislation thoroughly to
ensure that we understand our latitude in controlling concealed carry on
campus.”
The Texas version of campus carry is more watered down than the laws
passed by other states. In Utah, the presidents of the public colleges have no
discretion to write concealed-handgun rules. At Southern Utah University in
Cedar City, students and faculty can have concealed weapon just about
anywhere on campus — in classrooms, dormitory buildings and at sporting
events.
“It’s never been an issue,” said Rick Brown, the university’s chief of police.
The only episode he could recall was the day a few years ago when a
teacher found a loaded clip in a classroom after class was dismissed and
notified the campus police. Mr. Brown said the clip apparently fell out of a
student’s backpack during class.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,New York Times,06-02-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-guns-on-campus.html,10-06-2015
0,"Year After Death, Business as Usual at Arizona Gun Range","WHITE HILLS, Ariz. — Antonio Nárdiz, a Spanish tourist from Bilbao, said he
had chosen a family vacation to America for one specific reason: to fulfill his
sons’ dreams of firing real machine guns. In Spain, he noted, 10-year-old Jon
and 12-year-old Toni, like all other civilians, are forbidden to use automatic
weapons.
Mr. Nárdiz, 47, had heard that a family trip to an American gun range
turned tragic last year when a 9-year-old girl lost control of an Uzi submachine
gun, killing her instructor. So when Mr. Nárdiz selected that same range for his
family’s adventure — a place called Last Stop, just an hour’s drive from Las
Vegas — he called ahead to ask about security. Someone told him, “It’s
practically impossible for an accident to occur,” he said.
In the year since a New Jersey girl visited Last Stop and accidentally killed
Charles Vacca, a 39-year-old father of four, little has changed in the nation’s
tourist-oriented machine gun ranges. Last Stop’s range, which receives 100 to
200 visitors a week, is one of about a dozen places in the Las Vegas area that
offer machine gun adventures.
“I promised that one day I would bring them to fire guns,” Mr. Nárdiz said
just after his children had used automatic weapons to pound bullets into a dirtpacked
berm. “So I looked on the Internet, and I found this place. Everyone
spoke very highly of it. And the truth is that it’s fantastic.”
Mr. Vacca’s death on Aug. 25 prompted a brief but impassioned
conversation: Should Arizona and other states continue to allow children to
fire automatic weapons? A video of the girl and the gun in the moments before
Mr. Vacca’s death — she wore pink shorts and a ponytail — helped fuel the
debate.
This summer, the owner of Last Stop placed the blame squarely on his
employee, saying that while Mr. Vacca had been a beloved instructor, he had
died because he broke a company rule by standing next to the girl, not behind
her. The power of the gun in the hands of a preteen, the owner said, was not to
blame.
“We operate at the highest — a higher level of safety than most of the gun
ranges I’ve visited all over the world,” said the owner, Sam Scarmardo, 63.
Since Mr. Vacca’s death, he said, “there really wasn’t an awful lot of safety
improvement.”
Workers at several Las Vegas ranges said they still allowed children to
shoot, noting that they had long worked with young people and were well
equipped to do so. The Range 702 in Las Vegas, for example, allows people
ages 10 and up to shoot and has benches that instructors can adjust to different
heights.
Last Stop is a gas station and burger joint near the Nevada border. Mr.
Scarmardo added the range in 2013, and it is associated with a company called
Bullets and Burgers that picks up families and party groups at Las Vegas hotels
and brings them here to shoot guns and then enjoy a hamburger and a beer.
The company promises visitors a “Desert Storm atmosphere” and the
opportunity to shoot “the actual firearms” used in movies like “Rambo: First
Blood Part II.”
To many visitors, the experience is as quintessentially American as a
roller-coaster ride at Disney World or a boat tour at Niagara Falls.
“This is the American dream, right?” said Daniel Calvo, 31, a Spanish
tourist who had just sent a burst of bullets flying as five friends in flip-flops
and shorts cheered him on. “The guns, the trip to the Grand Canyon, the trip to
Las Vegas.”
After Mr. Vacca’s death, a sheriff’s investigation ruled the killing an
accident, and an inspection of the range by the Arizona Division of
Occupational Safety and Health found only violations it deemed minor, like
failing to train an employee in the safe use of work-related chemicals.
Mr. Scarmardo said he had decided after the accident to raise the age
requirement for shooting to 12, from 9, though employees are allowed to waive
that rule when they deem a child large and mature enough to handle a
powerful weapon.
“If you’ve got a kid who is five feet tall and as mature as a 25-year-old, he
can shoot,” Mr. Scarmardo said.
He added that children were typically restricted to using M16s or belt-fed
guns that rest on a table or other surface, though a range employee later said
he was unaware of that rule.
Nearly all instructors have military experience and receive two weeks of
training before they can assist clients. Tourists receive a safety briefing of five
to 10 minutes before they pull a trigger.
After Mr. Vacca’s death, legislators in at least two states, Arizona and
Louisiana, tried to pass laws that would have set a minimum age for handling
an automatic weapon. Both efforts failed. State Representative Victoria Steele,
a Democrat who proposed the Arizona bill, said her colleagues would not
consider supporting a bill that restricted gun use, fearing a backlash from the
National Rifle Association.
Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have laws that restrict
firearm use by children in some way, according to the Law Center to Prevent
Gun Violence.
In the days after Mr. Vacca’s death, his children released a video in which
they forgave the girl, who had come here with her parents and brother. In their
first statement since the video, the children — Ashley, 20, Elizabeth, 16, Tylor,
15, and Christopher, 12 — said through lawyers that they wanted legislation
that would set age minimums for using automatic weapons.
“They say over and over again: We don’t want this to happen again,” said
Marc Lamber, a lawyer for the Vacca family. “What do we need to do to stop
this from happening again?”
The family has decided not to sue the range or the girl, he said, choosing
to focus on changing the law. “Children shouldn’t be firing automatic
weapons,” Mr. Lamber added. “It’s just a matter of common sense.” The
parents of the girl, identified by police as the MacLachlans, declined to
comment.
On a recent weekday, Mr. Calvo, one of the Spanish tourists, was surprised
to learn from a reporter that Last Stop was the scene of the killing he had
heard about last year. One of his friends, Samuel Pueyo, 29, said: “Shooting is
fine as an experience, but for adults — not for children. It’s not ethical for a
child.”
But Mr. Nárdiz said he felt very safe, and his children, Jon and Toni,
agreed.
“Oh, my God,” Jon said, rattling off the names of the guns he had fired:
the MP5, the M4. “At the beginning it was a little scary, but it was so much
fun.” ",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,New York Times,08-22-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/year-after-death-business-as-usual-at-gun-range.html,10-06-2015
0,Jeb Bush Is Criticized for Saying ‘Stuff Happens’ in Reaction to Shootings,"GREENVILLE, S.C. — Jeb Bush invited a firestorm on Friday by saying that “stuff happens” in reference to renewed calls for legislative action after tragedies like the mass shooting in Oregon.

“I had this challenge as governor because we had — look, stuff happens,” he said at a forum in South Carolina. “There’s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”

The inelegant phrase immediately set off a wave of criticism from observers suggesting he was playing down the scourge of gun violence and the tragedy on Thursday, in which a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Roseburg, Ore.

Mr Bush, taking questions from the state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, was speaking about a pattern of proposing legislative responses that he said did not halt the tragedies they were meant to stop.

Asked afterward about the “stuff happens” comment, Mr. Bush said, “it wasn’t a mistake,” and requested that a reporter point out “what I said wrong.”

“Things happen all the time,” Mr. Bush said. “Things. Is that better?”

Asked what he meant, Mr. Bush said he was talking more generally about the tendency to pass laws in response to tragic events.

“Tragedies,” he said. “A child drowned in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools. Well it may not change it. Or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event. And the cumulative effect of this is, in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder to protect liberty.”

Mr. Bush said he was not referring specifically to Oregon when he said “stuff happens.”

At the forum at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., Mr. Bush boasted of his pro-gun record as Florida governor, recalling awards he received from the National Rifle Association and noting that he once received a gun from the group’s former president, Charlton Heston.

At a news conference in Washington, President Obama was asked to respond to Mr. Bush’s comments after being read a small portion of them.

“I don’t even think I have to react to that one,” Mr. Obama said, adding, “The American people should hear that.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Allie Brandenburger, said in an email that Mr. Bush’s critics were “taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy.”

“It is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush’s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy,” she said.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,New York Times,06-02-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/02/jeb-bush-is-criticized-for-saying-stuff-happens-in-reaction-to-oregon-shooting/,10-06-2015
0,At least 10 dead including gunman after Oregon college campus shooting,"It’s a tragedy that has become almost a routine — a young man goes on a shooting rampage at an American school, leaving behind nothing but bodies, grief and unanswered questions.
At least 10 are dead, including the shooter, and seven are injured after a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday. Police say the male shooter died in a shootout with police, who arrived at the scene within minutes of receiving an emergency phone call that came in at 10:38 a.m. local time.
“It has been a terrible day,” said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin during a news conference.
Hanlan said that police cornered the shooter in a campus building and exchanged gunfire.
“The shooter threat was neutralized,” he said.
Late Thursday, a government official identified the shooter as Chris Harper Mercer, 26. A law enforcement official said the shooter had three weapons, handguns and at least one long gun, the New York Times reported.
Hanlin made no guesses as to the shooter’s motive and said the investigation is still ongoing and will likely be a long one.
The sheriff’s department could only confirm 10 dead and seven injured at this time, Hanlin said. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum had earlier reported that there were at least 13 dead and 20 injured.
The college in rural southwestern Oregon has about 3,000 students and is busy on weekday mornings, officials said.
Kortney Moore told local newspaper the Roseburg News-Review that she saw her writing teacher get shot in the head by a stray bullet that went through a window. The 18-year-old said she heard the shooter enter a nearby classroom in Snyder Hall and order people to get on the ground.
He lined people up and asked them to state their religion before opening fire, she said.
Brady Winder, 23, told the newspaper that he had been in the classroom next door.
He heard a thud and then gunfire before seeing students run out of a classroom “like ants,” adding that people were screaming, “Get out!”
He said he saw one woman swim across a creek to get away.
It is the 45th school shooting in the United States this year, and the 142nd since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., according to gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand Action.
U.S. President Barack Obama made an address expressing his condolences and begging lawmakers to change the gun control laws in America.
“We see one of these every few months,” Obama lamented. “Each time this happens I’m going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say we can actually do something about it. But we’re going to have to change our laws.”
If the news of another school shooting feels routine, Obama argued, so too does the response on both sides of the gun-control debate.
Calls for stricter gun regulations in the U.S. have met with fierce opposition in Congress, and many expressed outrage on social media that today’s tragedy could have been prevented.
But those against tighter gun regulations accuse anti-gun advocates of “politicizing” the tragedy.
Hanlin, the sheriff overseeing the investigation, has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation.
He told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate wouldn’t prevent criminals from getting firearms. Hanlin also sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden in 2013, after the Sandy Hook shootings. Hanlin said he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions “offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.”
In the aftermath of the shooting, students who weren’t injured were evacuated to a nearby fairground where they were offered counselling. It was intended to be a place where their parents could pick them up.
But in the panic, many parents still didn’t know who was safe and who was in hospital.
“It is extremely sad to watch these families wait for the last bus,” said interim college president Rita Cavin.
Jessica Chandler, of Myrtle Creek, south of Roseburg, was at the fairground desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes.
“I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s wounded. I have no idea where she’s at,” Chandler said.
Carnes’ best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital, but she had not been able to find her at area medical centres.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Toronto Star,10-01-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/10/01/active-shooter-on-oregon-college-campus.html,10-06-2015
0,Paris attack: Rally the largest in French history as 3M take to the streets,"PARIS—France’s Interior Ministry said the Paris rally for unity against terrorism on Sunday was the largest demonstration in France’s history — a march organized to show harmony after three days of attacks that left 17 dead.
Calling the rally “unprecedented,” the ministry said the demonstrators were so numerous they spread beyond the official march route, making them impossible to count.
French media estimated up to 3 million took part, more than the numbers who took to Paris streets when the Allies liberated the city from the Nazis in World War II.
Their arms linked, more than 40 world leaders headed the sombre procession, setting aside their differences for a manifestation that French President François Hollande said turned the city into “the capital of the world.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood near Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also marched.
The deadly attacks on a satirical newspaper, kosher market and police marked a turning point for France that some compared to Sept. 11. In the weeks and months ahead, the cruelty will test how attached the French — an estimated 5 million of whom are Muslims — really are to their liberties and to each other.
“Our entire country will rise up toward something better,” Hollande said Sunday.
The aftermath of the attacks remained raw, withvideo emerging of one of the gunmen killed during police raids pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group and detailing how the attacks were going to unfold. Also, a new shooting was linked to that gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, who was killed Friday along with the brothers behind a massacre at satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in nearly simultaneous raids by security forces.
Rallies were planned throughout France and major cities around the world, including London, Madrid and New York — all attacked by al-Qaida-linked extremists — as well as Toronto, Montreal, Cairo, Sydney, Stockholm, Tokyo and elsewhere.
Children, grandparents, Muslims, Jews, Christians, workers, bosses — all joined together in streets and plazas thronged with crowds throughout eastern Paris.
On Paris’ Republic Square, deafening applause rang out as the world leaders walked past, amid tight security and an atmosphere of togetherness amid adversity. Families of the victims, holding each other for support, marched in the front along with the leaders, along with journalists working for newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the target of the attack that started three days of terror. Several wept openly.
“I Am Charlie,” read legions of posters and banners. Many waved editorial cartoons, and the French tricolour and other national flags.
The leaders marched down Voltaire Boulevard — named after the Enlightenment-era figure who symbolizes France’s attachment to freedom of expression. One marcher bore a banner with his famed pledge: “I do not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death to defend your right to say it.”
“It’s important to be here for freedom for tolerance and for all the victims. It’s sad we had to get this point for people to react against intolerance racism and fascism,” said Caroline Van Ruymbeke, 32.
The three days of terror began Wednesday when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honour of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly’s satire. Charlie Hebdo assailed Christianity, Judaism as well as officialdom of all stripes with its brand of sometimes crude satire that sought to put a thumb in the eye of authority and convention.
On Thursday, police said Coulibaly killed a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and on Friday, the attackers converged. While the Kouachi brothers holed up in a printing plant near Charles de Gaulle airport, Coulibaly seized hostages inside a kosher market. It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids at the printing plant and the market that left all three gunmen dead. Four hostages at the market were also killed.
Five people who were held in connection with the attacks were freed late Saturday, leaving no one in custody, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Coulibaly’s widow is still being sought and was last traced near the Turkey-Syrian border.
Early Sunday, police in Germany detained two men suspected of an arson attack against a newspaper that republished cartoons from Charlie Hebdo. No one was injured in that attack.
“The terrorists want two things: they want to scare us and they want to divide us. We must do the opposite. We must stand up and we must stay united,” French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told French TV channel iTele on Sunday.
France remains on high alert while investigators determine whether the attackers were part of a larger extremist network. More than 5,500 police and soldiers were being deployed on Sunday across France, about half of them to protect the march. The others were guarding synagogues, mosques, schools and other sites around France.
“I hope that we will again be able to say we are happy to be Jews in France,” said Haim Korsia, the chief rabbi in France, who planned to attend the rally.
At an international conference in India, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world stood with the people of France “not just in anger and in outrage, but in solidarity and commitment to the cause of confronting extremism and in the cause that extremists fear so much and that has always united our countries: freedom.”
Posthumous video emerged Sunday of Coulibaly, who prosecutors said was newly linked by ballistics tests to a third shooting — the Wednesday attack on a jogger in a Paris suburb that left the 32-year-old man gravely injured. In the video, Coulibaly speaks fluent French and broken Arabic, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group and detailing the terror operation he said was about to unfold.

0,Valentine’s Day massacre foiled in Halifax,"HALIFAX—Nova Scotia’s RCMP say an alleged plan by at least two suspects to carry out “mass killings” of civilians in a public place in the Halifax-area on Valentine’s Day has been foiled.
Asst. Commissioner Brian Brennan says a man who was found dead in a Halifax-area home early Friday intended to go to a public place with a woman and open fire on citizens before killing themselves.
Police received information from the public on Thursday morning of a potential significant weapons-related threat. The information suggested a 19-year-old Halifax-area man and a 23-year old woman from Geneva, Ill., had access to firearms, Brennan said.
“We received a threat that individuals were planning on targeting a public venue in Halifax, to go there and commit mass killings of civilians and to ultimately kill themselves,” Brennan said in a phone interview Friday night.
“Given the public venue that we believe was to be targeted, there was the potential for significant casualties and injury to citizens.”
Brennan would not say which venue was being targeted.
He says two other male suspects, ages 20 and 17, were also involved, although he says investigators were still trying to determine what their role was.
Brennan said firearms have been seized, although he could not say what kind, how many, or where the weapons were seized.
“The weapons seized had the ability to inflict a lot of casualties if used in a populated area,” said Brennan.
Police say they found the 19-year-old man dead at a home in the Halifax-area around 1:20 a.m. Friday.
Brennan would not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his death, saying the issue has been referred to the province’s Serious Incident Response Team, which reviews all serious incidents involving police in the province.
He said the 20-year-old man and 23-year-old woman were arrested around 2 a.m. at the Halifax airport. Brennan said the woman was arriving on a plane and the man was there to meet her.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested around 11 a.m. in the Halifax area, he said. Brennan said all three suspects remain in police custody and there’s no word on charges.
Brennan would not characterize the alleged plot as terrorism, saying the views of the individuals “were not based in religion or culture.”
He added that he’s “extremely confident” that all participants in the incident have been arrested.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Toronto Star,02-13-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/02/13/halifax-shooting-plot-stopped-by-police.html,10-06-2015
0,How 'American Sniper' plays in Baghdad,"When Gaith Mohammed, a young man in his twenties with a degree in accounting, went to see American Sniper during its opening week at Baghdad’s Mansour Mall, he says the theatre was full and rowdy.
“Some people watching were just concentrating, but others were screaming ‘F--k, shoot him! He has an IED, don’t wait for permission!!’” Mohammed laughed, recounting the film’s many tense scenes when U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, radios in for authorization to take out a potential threat.
The film, set during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and released on Christmas Day, hit nerves in the U.S. immediately. Some critics and commentators lauded it as patriotic and unflinching; others dismissed it as reductionist and racist.
Many people also objected to the film's portrayal of Kyle — a man who described Iraqis as “savages” in his memoir — as a hero.
Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie is based on a book by the late Kyle, now known as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. It has broken records, topped box office sales and racked up Oscar nominations, including one for best picture.
It’s been stirring controversy in Iraq, too.
In Baghdad, where much of the film is set, the movie drew full crowds at one of the city’s new upscale cinemas. Dressed in a fur-collared coat and loafers, Mohammed says many of the showings were sold out, and he knows of people who had to book their tickets a day in advance during opening week.
But after just a week on screens, the Mansour Mall theatre pulled the movie. A theatre employee sitting at the box office says management made the decision “because the hero of this film boasts of killing more than 160 Muslims.” The employee declined to give his name because he did not have permission to speak to journalists.
Mansour Mall attracts a largely upscale crowd in Baghdad. Behind tall gates and multiple layers of security complete with metal detectors and X-ray belts, the theatres here show a mix of Western and Arab films. Moviegoers interviewed at the mall say big budget action movies are usually the most popular, but romantic comedies and family dramas also do well.
Mohammed, who lived through the events in Baghdad the film depicts, admits that scenes where women and children were killed were hard for him to watch. But all in all he liked the movie.
“I love watching war movies because especially now they give me the strength to face ISIS,” he said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State. When asked if he thought the movie was racist or anti-Arab — a charge made by some critics in the West — he replied, “No, why? The sniper was killing terrorists, the only thing that bothered me was when he said he didn’t know anything about the Qur’an!”
But not all Iraqis were cheering on “Chief” Kyle’s kills. Wael, a government ministry employee in his thirties, says the film was too violent. He’s happy it’s no longer being shown in some Baghdad theatres.
“To some extent, I considered it against all Muslims,” he said. He also referred to the opening scene in Fallujah where a woman and child are killed.
“The sniper, he has a chance to hit the child and his mother in their foot or anywhere without killing them, but he didn’t because he’s bloodthirsty like all the American troops.”
At the Mansour Mall foodcourt outside the theatre, Omar Jalal, a university student, says he’s upset American Sniper is no longer being shown.
Jalal says the movie doesn’t strike him as racist or anti-Arab. He says he finds the main character appealing regardless of the fact that he’s an American soldier killing Iraqis during the U.S.-led occupation of his home country.
“He was a hero and he went through difficult training,” Jalal explained, saying Chris Kyle was just serving his country, a universal duty for all men. “Besides,” he shrugged, “it’s just a movie, and I like war movies. If they are true or not, whatever!”",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Toronto Star,01-29-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/01/29/how-american-sniper-plays-in-baghdad.html,10-07-2015
0,City of Light defies darkness after Charlie Hebdo attack: DiManno,"PARIS—Darkness falling on the City of Light.
The Eiffel Tower, usually luminously ablaze, blinkered its 20,000 bulbs and blinked briefly to black Thursday night.
Like a flame, extinguished.
Black, for mourning, as the shadow of terrorism lies menacingly across this bewildered city and this stricken nation.
But then suddenly flashing back to sparkly radiance. As Paris, defiant, has so vigorously repelled the objectives of fear and coercion and homicidal religious righteousness unleashed in the massacre at a satirical weekly magazine.
Who are they, these audacious gunmen? That’s now well enough known, as the suspects have been identified. Where are they? In the wind. On the run. Eluding, as of early Friday morning, a massive police dragnet concentrated around a rural village 80 kilometres northeast of here.
Their hijacked car abandoned, the pair of brothers fled on foot into a densely wooded area, according to the latest reports. Thousands of hectares of forest criss-crossed by footpaths, studded with hiding places.
But if they’re breathing, if their bodies were emitting heat in the cold night, they might show up on thermal imaging sensors brought to the dramatic manhunt by France’s military, as helicopters buzzed overhead.
This city, however, has barely had a chance to exhale amidst the mounting melodrama. Too many questions, worries, hang pendulously.
Paris is on edge. But it doesn’t want to be. It’s as if resilience, courage in the face of trauma, is all that citizens can control while unprecedented events swirl around them.
A couple of miles from the Eiffel Tower, pinpricks of light, hundreds and hundreds, flickered in the cool and damp evening air. Tiny votive candles lit in requiem for the dozen journalists and cartoonists and police officers slain in Wednesday morning’s stunning assault on the Charlie Hebdo offices. For the second night in a row, a massive crowd gathered spontaneously in the Place de la République — citadel of the French Republic’s democratic values — standing shoulder to shoulder at the feet of Marianne, the personification of France, black arm band fastened to the statue’s arm, as younger demonstrators clambered over the monument, leading the assembled in full-throated cheers:
WE ARE NOT AFRAID!
CHARLIE ISN’T DEAD!
I AM CHARLIE!
Counter-chants of bravado against the declaration made by one of the assailants, as he fled the scene of carnage: “We have killed Charlie Hebdo!”
No, they haven’t. The magazine will publish next Wednesday, as their murdered editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, and his staff would have wanted — a million issues set to roll out, more than ever before. Their lampooning voice, in words and drawings, will not be silence. Radical Islam is not off limits. It has, rather, been exposed yet again for the villainy at its merciless heart.
Around the République monument — liberté, égalité, fraternité, France’s national motto, inscribed on its plinth — poignant memorials have sprung up, piles of crayons and markers and pens and paintbrushes, the tools of the cartoonist’s trade, as understood by the public.
Revulsion perhaps best expressed in an Australian editorial caricaturist yesterday, of a terrorist standing over a dead cartoonist’s body: “He drew first!”
In the morning, an expression of solidarity at a rally organized nearby by France’s journalism unions, in one of the few countries where trade unions still have political traction. At high noon, on what was declared a national day of mourning, the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral tolling in solemn lamentation, hundreds prayed for the victims, including the eight wounded, four critically. Flags throughout the country flew at half-mast. And a minute of silence — a moment of national unity — was marked throughout the city, where even the Metro subway cars came to a halt in the tunnels and commuters stood to honour the dead. In schools, children hushed themselves, wide-eyed by events they may or may not understand. One Muslim child, captured by a photographer, holding a sign that read: “Not in my name.”
France has not given any indication of cracking open along fault lines of religious divisions. At the Place de la République, there were women wearing hijabs, warmly greeted. Although just-below-the-surface ruptures may shortly be bored open by the country’s far right politicians. “Our culture was attacked,” National Front leader Marine Le Pen, stated yesterday. “War has been declared on our way of life.”
Then she called for a referendum on the death penalty, which was abolished in France in 1981.
This is no war. This was a skirmish — with obviously widely radiating repercussions — as Islamic militants shift their operational tactics from the spectacular of 9/11 to smaller targeted missions that can engender just as much dread: the armed and fanatic lone wolf, or known wolf, as one of the brother suspects was convicted for aiding and abetting others to join jihadist movements, sentenced to 18 months in 2008.
This is however — and despite the firm pronouncements of defiance — a city of leeriness and confusion and anxiety.
Police sirens wail and it might be nothing or it could be something. Police vans burned rubber on the streets as rain fell all day in Paris. Hundreds of extra police and army troops have been added to the security ranks, yet another metropolis marked by the presence of the military in its midst — 200 soldiers from parachute regiments across the country brought to the capital.
Security officials fear copycat attacks or a secondary ambush. Could it really be possible that the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo operation — and it looks very much like an operation, carefully orchestrated, with a getaway plan attached — would so carelessly leave a personal ID card in the vehicle they abandoned afterward, leading immediately and directly to the French-born brothers, and police releasing photos of the suspects: Cherif and Said Kouachi, 32 and 34? The brothers were born in eastern Paris to Algerian parents who died when the boys were still children. They grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes.
Are they amateurs or trained jihadists?
While the enhanced security presence is necessary to protect Muslim places of worship as required — at least two mosques attacked in France over the past 48 hours, as well as a kebab shop, though no injuries were reported — the core fear is that this event was not plotted as a one-off. Or, even more chaotically and impossible to avert, that other like-minded malcontents will be inspired to launch their own assaults.
A fever pitch was hit Thursday morning when two police officers were gunned down in the southern Montrouge district of Paris by a man wearing a bulletproof vest, who fled. The female officer was killed. Last night, police were maintaining they did not believe the two events were linked but a second terrorism investigation was opened.
Nine people had been detained by late Thursday, though it’s unclear what their connection might be to either attack.
Police convoys carrying heavily armoured and masked anti-terrorism units raced to the scene around the villages of Corcy and Longpoint, holding journalists back four kilometres from the district of their sweep.
The fugitives had struck a service station nearby earlier in the day, robbing the operator of food and fuel, which further suggests they may not have been adequately prepared for an effective getaway. Some reports cast the men as operates of Al Qaeda in Yemen, others to the Islamic State. Both were definitely known to police and each had been on no-fly lists.
The helter-skelter nature of their escape is in marked contrast to the methodical orderliness of their butchery at Charlie Hebdo, where they attacked in the middle of the magazine’s weekly editorial meeting, apparently knowing in advance who would be in attendance and proceeding as if operating from a manifest list: calling out the names of those they intended to kill, shooting them in bursts, yet separating out some of the women, as one of the survivors told French magazine L’Humanité afterward. Freelance reporter Sigolene Vinson, who’d gone in Wednesday to attend the editorial meeting around the old U-shaped wooded desk, said the men had spared her, one of them stating: “I’m not killing you because you are a woman and we don’t kill women, but you have to convert to Islam.”
All for cartoons, for parody of the prophet Muhammad that, as in Denmark before, aggrieved the righteously radical, Charlie Hebdo a thorn in the side of pious Muslims as it was to Christian evangelicals and right-wing French politicians and any other target that seized its gleeful imagination.
“The lions of Islam have taken revenge on the heretics in the name of our Prophet,” IS said approvingly in a released statement.
Nearly three centuries ago, French writer and philosopher Voltaire encapsulated the freedom of expression that such jihadists cannot abide:
“I do not agree with what you have to say, but I’ll defend to the death your right to say it.”",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Toronto Star,01-08-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/01/08/city_of_lights_confronts_its_darkest_hour_dimanno.html,10-07-2015
0,"Jerry Dior, Designer of Major League Baseball’s Logo, Dies at 82","Jerry Dior, a graphic designer who created one of the most instantly recognizable logos in the history of American marketing — the silhouetted batter that has long symbolized Major League Baseball — but who received official credit for it only 40 years after the fact, died on May 10 at his home in Edison, N.J. He was 82.

The cause was cancer, his wife, Lita, said. His death was not made public until this week.

Adopted in 1969 to honor professional baseball’s centennial, the red-white-and-blue logo depicts a stylized batter facing an oncoming ball. Now ubiquitous, it appears on the caps, jerseys and helmets of major league players; on umpires’ uniforms; on television graphics; and on billions of dollars’ worth of licensed memorabilia annually.

Mr. Dior designed the logo in 1968, while working for Sandgren & Murtha, a New York City marketing concern. At the time, it seemed a routine assignment — an afternoon’s work, he later said — little different from his other projects there, which included package designs for Kellogg’s and Nabisco.

As was customary with work-for-hire designs, Mr. Dior received no royalties for his baseball logo, and no public credit. He did not expect to (his is an inherently anonymous calling), nor did he expect his work to endure: Logos are ephemeral things, with clients inclined to revamp them every few years.

But this particular logo did endure. By 2008, as ESPN.com wrote that year, it had become “a masterpiece of modern brand design” that was “more iconic and visible than ever.”

Yet Mr. Dior, who had never thought to retain a documentary record of the assignment, remained unacknowledged. It was not money he longed for, he said, but the simple act of recognition.

“Every now and then I tell someone the story about the logo, and their eyes go gaga, and I say to myself, ‘Hmm, do they really believe me or not?’ ” he told ESPN.com. “I want some sort of foothold or something, so I can prove that I really did this.”

Jerry Nicholas Dior was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1932; his mother was a homemaker, his father a dressmaker. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island and studied on scholarship at the Art Students League of New York. During the Korean War, he served stateside in the Army.

At Sandgren & Murtha, Mr. Dior was glad to land the M.L.B. assignment. A lifelong baseball fan, he adored the Dodgers until they traduced him by quitting Brooklyn in 1957, after which he threw his support to the Yankees.

Per his instructions, he drew a generic baseball player. (In interviews years later, Mr. Dior stressed that the figure was not modeled on Harmon Killebrew as many people, including Killebrew himself, believed.) He executed the design in Magic Marker, originally making it blue and green before switching to a patriotic palette.

“It just came to me,” Mr. Dior told The Wall Street Journal in 2008. “I did the rough sketch and cleaned it up a bit, and that was that. I never thought anything about it until I turned on the television and saw it on the New York Mets’ uniforms,” where it was emblazoned for the 1969 World Series.

Mr. Dior left Sandgren & Murtha shortly after designing the logo, and in later years he was a freelance graphic artist. But over time, especially as a string of professional sports logos, the National Basketball Association’s among them, were created as deliberate echoes of his design, the anonymity began to gnaw at him. He and his wife petitioned Major League Baseball for acknowledgment, to no avail.

Then, in 2008, The Journal profiled Mr. Dior, quoting former colleagues who attested to his authorship of the design. Other news organizations took up the story, creating a groundswell of support.

In 2009, after conducting its own inquiry, Major League Baseball officially recognized Mr. Dior as the logo’s creator, holding pregame ceremonies in his honor at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field.

“Jerry Dior created a symbol that has stood the test of time,” Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, said in a statement that year. “Forty years after its introduction, the ‘silhouetted batter’ is instantly recognized worldwide as the official emblem of Major League Baseball.”

Besides his wife, the former Lita Zweier, Mr. Dior’s survivors include four children, Mitchell, Rick, Jed and Donna Dior, and four grandchildren.

“I don’t think he ever thought he would be recognized and celebrated the way he was,” Mrs. Dior said of her husband in an interview on Friday. In 2009, Mr. Dior himself described the day he was first acknowledged as “one of the most exciting days of my life.”

In 2008, with recognition still eluding him, Mr. Dior was asked by ESPN.com how well he thought his logo had weathered the passing years.

“It holds up today as well as it did back then,” he said. “I truly feel it’s part of baseball. So I added a little something to the game, and I’m very proud of that.”",Soft News,Sports,New York Times,05-29-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/sports/baseball/jerry-dior-designer-of-major-league-baseballs-logo-dies-at-82.html,10-14-2015
0,"Pitino Mum, Questions Continue About Escort Allegations","LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Louisville coach Rick Pitino has apparently said all he plans to say for now about the troubling allegations outlined in a book by an escort that has led to a sex scandal looming over his men's basketball program.

Pitino was mum about the allegations on Saturday, but questions continue to swirl after the online release of Katrina Powell's book, ""Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen."" The 104-page book was published by an affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal and is scheduled for release Oct. 12, though the publisher said it could be sooner.

Kate Snedeker, a spokeswoman for IBJ Book Publishing LLC, said that Powell is not doing interviews.

While Pitino and Powell aren't talking about the book, Louisville confirmed Friday it has been investigating her allegations that Andre McGee brought escorts to dorm parties and paid the women to dance and strip, and have sex with recruits and players. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to join the staff at Missouri-Kansas City, which has placed him on paid administrative leave.

McGee could not be reached for comment and messages left with his Louisville attorney, Scott Cox, have not been returned.

Pitino was questioned about the allegations again after Saturday's Red-White scrimmage, but repeatedly said his focus is on coaching.

""I'm just going to concentrate on basketball,"" Pitino said Saturday, adding that he has not read the book and has no plans to read it. ""When adversity hits, the strong survive. ... Idleness is what makes the mind wander, so the best thing I can do is work, work, work.""

The coach also doesn't want players talking about it. He said his current roster had nothing to do with the allegations and has instructed them not to discuss the situation.

""We told them it's not your concern,"" he said, ""and I've been told to coach basketball and not do anything else. Not get involved in this.""

Cardinals forward Mangok Mathiang said it's out of the players' control.

""All we're trying to focus on is the season coming up and the teams we're going to play,"" said the 6-foot-10 junior, who sat out the scrimmage with an eye injury. ""There's always going to be adversity and we've been through it plenty of times before.""

As for the investigation, Mathiang added: ""Whatever comes out, comes out.""

UMKC head coach Kareem Richardson is also trying to focus on basketball on his campus. The Louisville assistant from 2012-13 and McGee's current boss, did say the matter is a ""serious concern.""

""We all need to allow the process to run its course without interference,"" he added in a statement Saturday. ""In the meantime, our coaches and student-athletes are focused on academics and basketball as the season gets under way.""

Louisville has retained Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, which assists schools in NCAA cases, to review the allegations. It is unclear if university police have begun an investigation. The age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18.

University officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA.

Powell said in the book that during a four-year period many of the activities took place in the players' dormitory.

The book said that Powell brought women to 22 parties from 2010 to 2014 at Billy Minardi Hall, which houses Cardinals basketball players. The woman said that she and three of her daughters, along with other women, danced and stripped for Louisville recruits and players and performed sex acts with them.

The 43-year-old Powell also said McGee paid her $10,000 for the visits plus tips and offered recruits alcohol at those parties.

In the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door. The process evolved to the point where the escorts entered and left the building through the front entrance and had become familiar to staff.

McGee started 57 games at Louisville from 2005-09. He played professionally in Europe before becoming a program assistant in 2010, and he was promoted to director of basketball operations in 2012.

The publishing company said it paid investigators and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Dick Cady to vet Powell's story, and based much of it on journal entries, photos and text messages.

With the allegations engulfing he program, Louisville fans showed their support at Saturday's scrimmage for Pitino and his players, greeting them with cheers as they entered the court at the KFC Yum! Center.

""Everybody wants to band together,"" Mathiang said. ""We can't let nothing like this come between us.""",Soft News,Sports,New York Times,10-03-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/03/us/ap-bkc-louisville-escorts.html,10-14-2015
0,Elena Delle Donne Emerges as Face of the W.N.B.A.,"UNCASVILLE, Conn. — After Elena Delle Donne was selected No. 2 in the 2013 W.N.B.A. draft, people wondered if she would fulfill the lofty expectations that accompanied such a distinction and become a transcendent player for a league continually fighting for recognition in American sports.

Delle Donne was overpowering at the college level at Delaware, which is not a powerhouse program like Connecticut, where she briefly went before choosing to play closer to her home.

With the league’s best players gathered at Mohegan Sun Arena for Saturday’s W.N.B.A. All-Star Game, Delle Donne’s colleagues, including Brittney Griner — the player selected No. 1 in 2013 — and the league president are acknowledging that she has arrived at that moment.

“She’s doing what everybody expected,” Griner said. “Elena, she’s a dominant player. It’s good for the league, how everybody always is talking about Delle Donne.”

Griner’s teammate Diana Taurasi, often considered the best women’s basketball player in the world, is sitting out the W.N.B.A. season at the request of the Russian team she plays for during the winter. Other stars, like the 2014 most valuable player, Maya Moore, are consistent all-around threats, but no player has grabbed the mantle in Taurasi’s absence like Delle Donne, the leader of the Chicago Sky.

“I feel like I’ve worked my entire life for opportunities like these,” Delle Donne, 25, said. “Obviously, there’s a ton of incredible players in the league that could step up any week, any month and be phenomenal. I’m comfortable in the role because I put in that much work. People who work this hard deserve things like that.”

In her first two years with the Sky, the 6-foot-5 Delle Donne established herself as one of the best pure scorers in the W.N.B.A., averaging 18 points a game. This season, she leads the league in scoring at 24.5 points a game and is on pace to challenge Taurasi’s single-season scoring record of 860 points.

“She is deadly in that 15-foot area,” San Antonio Stars guard Kayla McBride said. “Her 3-point game and her rebounding on top of that? She’s averaging a double-double and making it look easy. You can throw double teams at her, whatever you want to try and get her out of her comfort zone, but it’s kind of hard to find where she’s not comfortable on the court.”

One area where Delle Donne lacked proficiency in recent years was rebounding. Sky Coach Pokey Chatman challenged Delle Donne to improve her rebounding during the off-season.

Instead of competing overseas to earn extra money like a majority of W.N.B.A. players, Delle Donne stayed home and worked on her craft.

This season, she is averaging a career-high 9.8 rebounds a game, more than twice as many as last season. Delle Donne, who often plays guard, is second in the league in total rebounds (167), behind Tulsa Shock center Courtney Paris.

Chatman said she now entered every game believing she had the best player in the league on her roster in Delle Donne.

“I say that not against any other player,” Chatman said. “I’m aware of the things that she’s doing that may not show up on the stat sheet or highlights. She allows me to play five different defenses; she plays four different positions. That, to me, is what separates her.”

Delle Donne experienced a turning point on June 24 in a 45-point effort against the Atlanta Dream. She displayed a full arsenal of offensive moves — behind-the-back dribbles leading to up-and-under baskets in the post, crossover pull-up jumpers and finger-roll layups.

Watching Delle Donne that night, Dream guard Shoni Schimmel took note of how aggressive she had become in drawing contact and earning free throws. Delle Donne finished 19 for 19 from the foul line in the 100-96 overtime victory. This season, she has made 119 of 125 free throws.

“She’s the best,” Dream forward Angel McCoughtry said. “No one can guard her.”

Delle Donne and Chatman credited the team’s new point guard, Cappie Pondexter, with adding a new level of confidence to Delle Donne’s catalog. Together, they have led the Sky to an 11-6 record and second place in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break.

“Her skill level is one of a kind,” Pondexter said of Delle Donne.

For the first time in three years, Delle Donne is also playing without pain. She has been named an All-Star three times, and as a testament to her popularity among fans, she was the leading vote-getter twice, including this year. But she missed the 2013 and 2014 games because of concussion symptoms and ailments related to Lyme disease.

“I feel like more than anything, I’ve been healthy this season,” Delle Donne said.

With a clean bill of health, Delle Donne has ascended in becoming the league’s most recognizable player, replete with regular national television appearances.

Tamika Catchings, one of the league’s marquee players over the last decade, said Delle Donne had long possessed the basketball talent to be considered the best and now had to grow into accepting the public responsibility of representing an entire league.

0,Judge Erases Tom Brady’s Suspension; N.F.L. Says It Will Appeal,"In Roger Goodell’s nearly decade-long zeal to establish order in the National Football League, he has handed down penalties for everything from domestic violence to dogfighting to deflating footballs.

But as was made apparent again Thursday, when a federal judge threw out a four-game suspension he assessed against the league’s biggest star, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, the commissioner continues to stumble in policing America’s most popular sport and making the tough calls stick. Goodell had suspended Brady in connection with accusations that he played a role in deflating footballs for competitive advantage in a January championship game.

Like his predecessors in the N.F.L. and in other leagues, who for decades have had broad powers to protect the integrity of their sports, Goodell has made progress prosecuting players for using steroids, recreational drugs and other banned substances detectable with science.

Players armed with high-priced lawyers and publicists, and backed by a players’ union led by a former prosecutor, have mined sometimes arcane labor law to argue they were denied due process and to resist Goodell’s self-proclaimed goals to rein in misconduct.

“It really is exceptional how the federal courts have taken on the role of super-arbitrator of the N.F.L.’s disciplinary standards,” said Michael LeRoy, a sports labor law specialist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “Commissioners have traditionally been godlike authorities dating back to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The fact that you can go to court and get a judge to tell the commissioner what he can and can’t do is extraordinary. It feels there are three parties at the bargaining table: the N.F.L., the union and the courts.”

The Brady case is emerging as the most vivid example of Goodell’s efforts and their pitfalls.

In vacating Brady’s suspension, handed down in May after a league investigative report determined the quarterback was most likely aware that two team equipment staff members had deflated balls in an apparent bid to give him a better grip on them, Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan did not focus on whether Brady had tampered with the game balls. He did not question the outcome of the game, a 45-7 Patriots victory over the Indianapolis Colts as the team marched on to win the Super Bowl.

Instead, he focused on the narrower question of whether the collective bargaining agreement between the N.F.L. and the players’ union gave Goodell the authority to carry out the suspension, and whether Brady was treated fairly during his attempt to overturn the punishment.

Judge Berman, in a 40-page decision that the N.F.L. has indicated it plans to appeal, found several “significant legal deficiencies” in the N.F.L. case. He ruled that Brady was not treated fairly and could not be suspended for deflating footballs because he was not aware such misconduct could lead to the kind of punishment he received.

“General awareness” of others’ misconduct, a reference to equipment handlers who may have actually deflated the balls, was not enough to suspend him, the judge said.

“The court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and noncooperation with the ensuing investigation,” Berman wrote.

“No N.F.L. policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others,” he added.

Even if the league believed Brady had obstructed the investigation, by having a cellphone destroyed before it could be fully examined, as the N.F.L. asserted he had done, the judge sided with Brady’s argument that “there is no evidence of a record of past suspensions based purely on obstructing a league investigation.”

He found that the N.F.L. did not give Brady adequate notice of the potential penalty for the misconduct he was accused of and that he had been denied sufficient access to the N.F.L.’s investigative files and to a top league legal official reviewing the case.

The way is cleared for Brady to play in the Patriots’ opening game Sept. 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Foxborough, Mass. Already, the case had made for a protracted spectacle pored over and at times ridiculed on social media. There was the morning Brady, a player most likely bound for the Hall of Fame, walked into the sober confines of a federal courthouse in Manhattan — with the ensuing jostle of the paparazzi and even a courtroom sketch that many felt maligned him and caused an Internet sensation. The judge himself at one point seemed to wonder if there were not more important matters in the world.

Now, the N.F.L. may brace for a nationally televised hero’s welcome for Brady accepting adulation from hometown fans not just for winning last season’s Super Bowl, but for winning what at times has seemed like a personal showdown between the commissioner and one of his most marketable players.

If Goodell thought he could win the day in court, he may have to rethink the strategy or take the chance that appellate judges might be more sympathetic on further review.

In recent years, judges have found themselves enmeshed in cases involving players suspended for beating their children, punching their girlfriends and other criminal behavior far removed from the field of play. In the N.F.L., many of these cases fall under the personal conduct policy that legal experts say often falls short of clarity. This has allowed Goodell to penalize players, but also left him exposed to allegations that he has abused his powers.

Lawyers are split on how the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit might rule. The league may argue that the labor agreement gives the commissioner wide latitude to take action against misconduct, even if his methods are imperfect, logic that judges have used to uphold the vast majority of arbitration rulings.

But the appeals court may also agree with Berman, said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law at Fordham University, because of all the procedural flaws he identified in the league’s handling of the case.",Soft News,Sports,New York Times,09-03-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/sports/football/tom-brady-suspension-deflategate.html,10-15-2015
0,N.F.L. Will Stream Game From London Next Season,"PHOENIX — The N.F.L. will begin experimenting with streaming games worldwide next season as it searches for more broadcast revenue and ways to reach the growing number of consumers who do not pay for cable and satellite television.

The owners of the league’s 32 teams, who are holding their annual meeting here, were told that the Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game Oct. 25 in London would be available for free to viewers around the world.

The game will still be shown on television in the Buffalo and the Jacksonville markets. But by live-streaming the game on its website, the league will be able to bypass cable and satellite companies that traditionally take a cut of the revenue from broadcasting games.

The N.F.L., joining other content producers who are seeking to reach consumers directly, is looking for ways to reach consumers who do not have cable subscriptions.

“We’re testing alternative ways to distribute games,” said Brian Rolapp, the executive vice president of media at the N.F.L.

He said that the league’s current model of showing games on network television remains solid, but there are millions of homes without pay television packages and that could accelerate.

“If the world ever changes, we want to be prepared,” he said.

By streaming the game itself, the league can also reach fans in markets overseas where it is expensive to set up individual broadcast deals with local cable and satellite companies to carry games, according to Marc Ganis, a consultant to several N.F.L. teams. (An N.F.L. spokesman said the league was studying whether to hold the 2017 Pro Bowl in Brazil.)

Streaming games could also give the league more leverage with CBS, NBC and other networks when they negotiate television rights deals because the league would have the capability of showing more games itself, Ganis said.

The N.F.L. is still seeking an Internet distributor for the game, and that distributor is expected to keep the advertising revenue, Rolapp said. It is unclear whether the league will expand the number of games streamed and how soon, he added.

Separately, the league said that it would not black out games in local markets when teams failed to sell out their stadiums next season. This so-called blackout policy began in 1973 as a way to encourage fans to buy tickets to games rather than watch them free on television. Under the policy, a home game could be shown in a team’s local market if the game was sold out 72 hours in advance of kickoff.

As team ticket sales have improved, the number of games blacked out fell to zero last season and to two in 2013. The owners voted Monday to suspend the policy for the 2015 season and evaluate the results.

The N.F.L.’s decision comes after the Federal Communications Commission in September repealed its sport blackout rules, which prohibited cable and satellite operators from importing the signal of a game when it was blacked out locally.

The F.C.C.’s ruling did not affect the league’s ability to enforce its blackout policy through contractual arrangements.",Soft News,Sports,New York Times,03-23-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/sports/football/nfl-will-stream-game-from-london-next-season.html,10-15-2015
0,Blue Jays end 22-year wait for the post-season: Griffin,"The Blue Jays’ magic number has morphed into a Blue Jays magic moment.
The Jays are finally and officially guaranteed a spot in the playoffs for the first time in 22 long, painful seasons. And not just by some convoluted twist of permutations and combinations but by their play on the field.
Sure, it’s just the first step. Sure, the Jays are simply assured of a wild-card berth. There was champagne after the 10-8 win over the Rays on Saturday, that had waited, even though the numbers showed they had clinched even before David Price toed the rubber. But there is still work to be done. It was almost like a clubhouse celebration with training wheels, although for guys like Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, R.A. Dickey and manager John Gibbons, all veterans dancing for the first time, the moment had to be special.
The Jays will tell you the bar of their success will be set at nothing short of an AL East crown over the Yankees and, further, to first place overall, ahead of Kansas City, which would gain them home-field advantage throughout. Those are the magic numbers that will count as champagne-worthy.
But getting a foot in the door is a necessary and important first step that guarantees meaningful baseball games in October, in Toronto, for the first time since Joe Carter’s dramatic walk-off blast against Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series accompanied by Tom Cheek’s magical call of “Touch ’em all, Joe.” Perspective? Jays closer Roberto Osuna was not yet born.
Simply by the numbers, the Jays played 22 seasons and 3,499 games, including Friday’s series opener against the Rays, without qualifying for the post-season. Sometimes I think it’s my fault. I began covering the Jays, writing columns on opening day of the 1995 schedule, a season that was delayed because of the late settlement of the 1994 strike by Sonia Sotomayor, now a Supreme Court justice, on the eve of what would have been an opening day for the Jays in Dunedin, Fla., with replacement players.
That’s a playoff-less drought of 20 seasons for the primary major-league team that I have been covering. In a previous life as media relations guy with the Montreal Expos, I spent 22 seasons with a team that earned a berth in just one post-season, the strike-interrupted 1981 campaign, advancing to within one win of playing the Yankees in the World Series. Other than that, 41 years of nada.
The following is a list of the only six seasons during that long playoff drought in which the Jays finished with a single-digit deficit in either the division or the wild-card race, six years in which they teased the fans and then backed away from the playoff table and failed again.
2000: Third place in the AL East, 4.5 games behind the Yankees. In manager Jim Fregosi’s second and final season, lefty David Wells spearheaded the rotation with 20 wins. The Jays finished behind the Yankees and Red Sox, but came as close as they had to winning the AL East. The Jays won four in a row in the third week of September to close within 4.5 games, but faded to 2-8 down the stretch to drop to third.
1998: Four games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The Yankees swept away the East with 11 wins, but the Jays battled the Red Sox for the wild card in manager Tim Johnson’s only season. This was the first time the Jays went large in this stretch adding DH Jose Canseco, catcher Darrin Fletcher and closer Randy Myers to an already powerful lineup and deep rotation. The proximity to the Sox was somewhat a mirage because the Jays won win six of seven in the final week to pull back to within four games.
2014: Five games behind the A’s for the wild card. The Jays had an opportunity to participate in the race last year with two wild cards up for grabs, but the Royals finished with 89 wins and the A’s with 88. The Jays were in year two of manager John Gibbons’ second tour of duty, led by five pitchers with 11 or more wins and more solid work by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. The Jays were just 3.5 games behind the Royals on Sept. 17, then lost seven straight to make a strong finish after that meaningless.
2006: Eight games behind the Tigers for the wild card. This was Gibbons’ first tour with the Jays and his best record as manager until this year, winning 87 games. Lefty B.J. Ryan notched 38 saves and Vernon Wells hit .303 with 32 homers and 106 RBIs. Third baseman Troy Glaus slammed 38 homers with 104 RBIs. Once again, this wild-card race was not as close as it seems, as the Tigers, who had 82 wins by Aug. 27, faded down the stretch and finished with 95 wins and the wild card, then went to the World Series.
2003: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The best season for manager Carlos Tosca resulted in 86 wins, but a 15-game deficit to the Yankees and a nine-game gap to the wild-card Red Sox. Roy Halladay won 22 games and worked 266 innings, while Carlos Delgado and Wells combined for 75 homers and 262 RBIs. The Jays were 72-72 on Sept. 9 and charged hard down the stretch, going 14-4 to provide false home for the future. They were never close to the wild-card despite the numbers.
2008: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. Gibbons was fired in June while just four games under .500, replaced by Cito Gaston. The Jays responded to the familiar guidance of their World Series manager, learning to once again go to the plate with a plan, an approach. Halladay and A.J. Burnett combined for 38 wins, while Ryan had 32 saves. The Jays won 10 in a row in September to pull within seven games of the Red Sox, but were 8-10 in the final three weeks to finish comfortably out of it.
2015: Playoff bound. Finally the Jays are back in the playoffs, but with still more work to do to ensure the best possible seeding. Catcher Russell Martin has helped four different teams to the post-season in his first season with them — the Dodgers (2006), the Yankees (2011), the Pirates (2013) and the Jays (2015). That’s not just luck.

0,Sizzling slugger Edwin Encarnacion notches hat trick for Blue Jays: DiManno,"PANDEMONIUM: A state of uproar, shortened to roar for our purposes. Which is what Edwin Encarnacion detonated with three home runs. That was 1,136 feet of dinger all together.
Pandemonium: The term for a flock of parrots. Which is what Double-E, on triple long balls, had figuratively perched on his right arm as he circled the bases Saturday afternoon — a pantomime that has evolved from chicken wing, first time we saw the whimsical gesture, to exotic toucan.
Last belt was a seventh-inning grand slam, ninth career, third this season. Nine runs driven in on the day for EE, tying a club record and extending his hitting streak to a major-league-leading 24 games.
En-sanity.
Then came the lids, dozens of them flung onto the field, because even a sell-out baseball crowd is never far from its point-of-reference hockey roots — hat trick at the Rogers Centre.
Encarnacion was puzzled when it started raining chapeaus, as were many of his ’mates in the dugout, until Dioner Navarro provided an explanation. “He tell me, like, when they score three goals — I think? — they do that. It made me feel happy.”
The manager too was taken aback. “I hadn’t seen it before. Don’t they normally throw octopuses or something?”
Octopi, John Gibbons. And that’s only at The Joe, where the other sports team from Detroit plays, not the outfit the Blue Jays routed on Saturday 15-1 as they continued their explosively awesome ways.
Big innings. Humongous power. Scary torque.
Really, it’s getting ridiculous, especially as the Jays have been cutting a swath through August: 20-5 and the month’s not done yet.
It’s been a top-to-bottom of the roster lollapalooza — Toronto 1.5 games up on the Yankees — with Encarnacion and Josh Donaldson leading the un-dog-days of summer charge. For EE, a six-pack of three-plus RBI efforts in his last 17 contests.
One can get smothered in the stats. The more telling gauge, on this occasion, was that lit-up smile on Encarnacion’s face. Sweetest smile on the team. Only chore was standing up in front of the cameras in the clubhouse afterwards. It is always a discomfiting demand for Encarnacion, who’s still shy speaking in English. He prefers smaller gatherings at his cubicle, with only the writers posing questions.
“I know this is the bigger game,” he said, when asked where this memorable outing ranked. “I feel happy. And I thank God for giving me this game like this.”
At the plate in the seventh, bases loaded, Encarnacion said he wasn’t envisioning grand salami. “No, I never thinking about that. I was just thinking about taking good AB, looking for my pitch.”
Fastball down the middle from reliever Alex Wilson and Encarnacion feasted on it.
“It’s very fun. But it’s more fun that we’re winning games. That’s what we’ve been doing, winning games. Having fun, everybody, the team.”
How demoralizing it must be for opposing pitchers, having to contend with The Four Men of the Apocalypse at the top of Toronto’s batting order colossi, and then everybody else because there’s not a single weak link, as 18 hits, including four HRs Saturday proved yet again. Only Jose Bautista failed to get a hit, though he walked twice and accounted for two runs.
“I don’t think it can get any better,” marveled Gibbons, speaking specifically about his first basemen-DH. “When I was here coaching first base, Carlos Delgado hit four in one game. Don’t know how many RBIs he had.
“(Encarnacion) is some kind of locked in. When he gets going there’s nobody better, nobody more dangerous.”
The Jays aren’t just beating teams, they’re annihilating them.
“To score as many runs as we’ve had — big, big innings like we’d had — it surprises the hell out of me to be honest with you,” said the skipper. “I can’t say you start expecting it. What it does is, you’re never really out of a game.”
Except they are expecting it. This is how the Jays roll — ML-leading 709 runs, best run-differential in the majors.
For Encarnacion, the only regret was that his young son hadn’t been on hand to witness dad’s record-book day. Eddie Jr. has gone back to the Dominican with school starting. Back on the island, no one has ever seen Encarnacion crank three homers in one day.
“That doesn’t happen in the Dominican. The parks are too big.”
Encarnacion’s pyrotechnics eclipsed what was also a momentous game for several teammates.
Ben Revere extended his own hitting streak to eight games with a double on four hits and run scored. But his most impressive play was a spectacular catch at the wall in the first, when starter Drew Hutchison was still looking for his groove and giving up some alarming long fly ball outs. On that at-bat to Victor Martinez, Hutch visibly flinched as the ball carried and carried. Revere bounced off the ’pen fence to get it in his glove.
“Victor, I’ve been watching him my whole life, he’s got a lot of power,” said Revere. “He kind of got me turned around a little bit. I thought I had another step to brace myself. Hit the chain fence pretty hard. Just trying to win good defence. Defence wins championships, so just doing my part.”
Took enough of a bruising boing off that fence, however, that Revere required an hour-long soak in the hot-tub post-game.
You might recall that the Toronto surge began on July 29, with the arrival of Troy Tulowitzki, who homered that night — now that was storybook epic — against Philadelphia. Revere was leading off for the Phillies in that game. Made it just under the trade deadline for transformation shortly thereafter into a Blue Jay.
Feels like he stepped into heaven, reeled in by GM Alex Anthopoulos, coming over here, being part of this.
“When I got that call from Alex, it was definitely: Open the gates. It was one of those deals where you drop down on your knees and pray, getting out of that situation (in Philadelphia).”
Three hits — all carbon copies, singles through the hole into centre — for the always defensively stalwart Ryan Goins too. For good measure, his first career stolen base and a run scored by tagging up on a Donaldson sac fly — from second, goodness — when ex-Jay Anthony Gose apparently forgot how many outs there were, no throw.
“Just being relaxed, going out there with a clear mind, I think that helps a lot. Just getting comfortable and trying to be the best I can be for this team.”
Best team in baseball since the all-star break.
The dictionary provides a third definition for pandemonium: “The abode of all demons, hell.”
Hell to pay, playing Toronto: Demonic Jays.

0,Nick Kyrgios fined by ATP for ‘insulting remark’ at Rogers Cup,"The ATP fined Nick Kyrgios $10,000 (U.S.) on Thursday for his “insulting remark” toward French Open champion Stan Wawrinka during a match at the Rogers Cup.
Wawrinka had urged tennis authorities to take action in a Twitter post earlier Thursday.
On Wednesday night, a courtside microphone picked up Kyrgios saying that fellow Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis had slept with a player who is reportedly Wawrinka’s girlfriend.
Wawrinka later tweeted: “There is no need for this kind of behaviour on or off the court and I hope the governing body of this sport does not stand for this.”
He called the 20-year-old’s Australian’s words “not only unacceptable but also beyond belief.”
Kyrgios posted an apology Thursday on his Facebook page.
“I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the comments I made during the match last night vs Stan Wawrinka,” he said. “My comments were made in the heat of the moment and were unacceptable on many levels. In addition to the private apology I’ve made, I would like to make a public apology as well. I take full responsibility for my actions and regret what happened.”
The $10,000 fine is the maximum for incidents of verbal abuse or unsportsmanlike conduct.
The 30-year-old Wawrinka, ranked fifth in the world, announced in April that he had separated from his wife, with whom he has a daughter. The Swiss player has since been linked with 19-year-old Donna Vekic of Croatia, who is ranked 127th.
Vekic played mixed doubles with Kokkinakis, also 19 and ranked No. 76, at the 2014 Australian Open as a wild-card entry.
Kyrgios beat Wawrinka on Wednesday when the Swiss player retired with a lower-back injury while trailing 4-0 in the third set.
In a post-match interview on court, Kyrgios said Wawrinka had provoked him.
“He was getting a bit lippy at me so, I don’t know, it’s just in-the-moment sort of stuff,” Kyrgios said. “I don’t really know, I just said it.”
Wawrinka’s coach, Magnus Norman, also criticized Kyrgios, who has been at the centre of controversy in recent weeks.
“That was really really low Nick Kyrgios,” Norman wrote on Twitter. “Hope for u that u have people around that will teach u a thing or 2 about life tonight. Very bad.”
At Wimbledon last month, Kyrgios was booed by spectators in a fourth-round loss to Richard Gasquet of France. Kyrgios appeared to make little attempt to return Gasquet’s serve during the third game of the second set after a dispute with the chair umpire.
That incident prompted Australian swimming great Dawn Fraser to question the character of Kyrgios and suggest he could leave the country and return to where his parents came from.
Kyrgios, who was born in Australia to a father born in Greece and mother born in Malaysia, replied on Twitter that Fraser was a “blatant racist.” She later apologized.",Soft News,Sports,Toronto Star,08-13-2015,http://www.thestar.com/sports/tennis/2015/08/13/nick-kyrgioss-outburst-puts-australian-tennis-back-in-unsavoury-spotlight.html,10-15-2015
0,"Kayakers land Canada’s first Pan Am Games gold
","It is agony and it is joy — two minutes of intense emotions on either end of the spectrum — and for four Canadian paddlers it created a moment they will cherish.
The women’s K-4 500 team of Michelle Russell, Emilie Fournel, KC Fraser and Hannah Vaughan won Canada’s first gold of the Pan Am Games in the first medal event early Saturday morning in Welland, kickstarting an excellent day for the host nation.
The exuberance after the race was “indescribable,” Fraser said. The couple of minutes before it was anything but.
“When we paddle, our face is total agony, our lips are going sideways, our eyes are closed, we’re seeing stars,” said Fournel, a 28-year-old Montrealer. “And then within two seconds, this changes into a smile. You cross the line and you see you’ve won. It’s a pretty incredible feeling.
“You get the stress feeling at the beginning of the race. The race goes and you get the crazy pain feeling, and then you cross the line and it’s total joy. It’s everything in two minutes.”
Canada’s time of one minute 36.495 seconds was 1.17 seconds better than the second-place Cubans and 1.23 seconds in front of Argentina.
Being able to put the hosts on the medal board right off the bat was not only an accomplishment the women were proud of, but also a message to the rest of the 720-member Canadian contingent — the country’s largest ever for a multi-sport Games.
With team officials setting a best-ever goal of a second-place finish, winning quickly may set a tone.
“I was a little bit nervous, but incredibly excited to be able to kick the Games off on the right note for Canada,” said Vaughan. “When you’re an athlete, you learn to use momentum to your advantage . . . in any sport, I think, and I hope this medal can help carry Canada through to the rest of the Games.”
The robust, loud crowd at the Welland Flatwater Centre certainly helped generate some adrenaline among the women, who were competing at the most significant home event of their careers. They have trained and competed on the course since it opened, but Saturday was the first time they had a packed grandstand cheering them on.
“You just hear the crowd screaming so loud . . . and it just gives you that drive,” said Fraser. “It was like, ‘Okay, I’m doing it for all of you.’ ”
And in Fournel’s case, one fan in particular stood out.
“There was a little kid and he was all shy,” she said of the post-race celebration. “He came to me and said, ‘That was the best thing I’ve seen in all my life,’ and then he ran away.
“Crossing the line and getting this medal was really special, but being able to see all these people being out there for us was even better.”
Russell, from Fall River, N.S., had more business as she also qualified for Monday’s K-1 500-metre final. She will compete in the K-1 200 on Sunday morning, too, while Fournel and Vaughan, of Halifax, will race in the K-2 500-metre final Tuesday.",Soft News,Sports,Toronto Star,07-11-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2015/07/11/canada-grabs-first-pan-am-gold-in-kayaking.html,10-15-2015
0,Kentucky Derby winner American Pharoah can prove he’s a ‘great horse’ at the Preakness,"BALTIMORE—From a Kentucky horse farm to a sales ring in Saratoga to Bob Baffert’s barn at Santa Anita, American Pharoah gave every indication he’s a champion in the making.
So what if part of his tail is missing and he has cotton stuffed in his ears before races? To owner and breeder Ahmed Zayat, his Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness favourite is the horse of a lifetime.
“He is sheer brilliance and comes with unbelievable character,” said Zayat, who was just warming up. “He is a character. He is a horse that is kind, sweet, heady, classy, beautiful. It’s very rare to have a horse that has it all. He does everything as effortlessly as you can ever think.”
In the months after the bay colt was foaled at Stockplace Farm, outside Lexington, Ky., on Feb. 2, 2012, then moved to Vinery farm, Zayat received glowing reports, particularly about the way he acted around other horses.
“Usually, when they are young, they’re silly, they hit each other and jump on each other like little kids,” Zayat said. “I kept getting told he’s acting so mature and confident, like ‘I’m the leader of this group.’ ”
Right now, he’s leading many to believe he can win the Preakness on Saturday, set up a Triple Crown attempt in three weeks at the Belmont Stakes and end a record 37-year gap since Affirmed swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont.
“I am not going ahead of myself,” Zayat said. “We have to win the Preakness and have to see what happens before allowing myself to think of glory.”
Zayat, who has spent millions on horses since diving headfirst into the business 10 years ago, also is proud American Pharoah is a homebred, a son of his Derby runner-up Pioneerof the Nile and grandson of another Derby runner-up, Empire Maker. His mother is a horse named for Zayat’s daughter, Emma, Littleprincessemma.
“A to Z, he is Zayat blood,” the owner said of American Pharoah. “His dad is the first horse I bred who won a Grade 1. It’s like saying your first team ever won the Super Bowl. And now he comes and wins the Derby and avenges the losses of his dad and grandfather?”
At Vinery, it was Frances Relihan, operations manager at the time, who told Zayat his colt stood out.
“She told me he is ‘the best foal she ever saw,’ ” Zayat recalled. “He was just showing tremendous leadership qualities.”
And then it was on to Taylor Made, where the sales team convinced Zayat his colt could raise Pioneerof the Nile’s profile with breeders, owners and buyers.
So into the ring he went at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga selected yearling sale, but with a caveat. Zayat would not sell for under $1 million. As it turned out, Zayat bought him back for $300,000.
On to Ocala, Fla., where American Pharoah learned how to be a racehorse. The breaking process went well, and Zayat called in trainers for his “breeze show” to showcase his latest crop.
Baffert immediately stated lobbying Zayat’s son Justin, the general manager of Zayat Stables.
“As soon as I saw this horse work on the farm, I sent him a video and Bob said to me, ‘Justin, remember the Breeders’ Cup is in California this year,” Justin Zayat said. “He wanted our horse. He saw how good he was from Day One. If you want to give a horse time to prepare for the Derby, you’re going to give him to Bob Baffert.”
All did not go well when American Pharoah arrived in Baffert’s barn at Santa Anita. The colt, who, according to Zayat, lost part of his tail when Preakness rival Mr. Z bit it when they were in the field, was a sensitive sort. Distracted occasionally. It showed in his first race. Under Martin Garcia, he ran second most of the race, went wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch and finished fifth going 5 and a half furlongs at Del Mar.
Baffert went the cotton route for a fix — cotton in the ears (earplugs if you will). It’s standard operating procedure before each race now. Not much acting up anymore, and no losses since.
With a new rider in Victor Espinoza, American Pharoah won the Del Mar Futurity and the FrontRunner Stakes with ease. He would have been the favourite for the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, but Baffert noticed something wrong — a slight discomfort in the colt’s left front foot. American Pharoah missed the race, still was voted two-year-old champion and didn’t return to the races for nearly five and a half months.
“When he got hurt it was the most gut wrenching thing of my life,” Justin Zayat said. “When he came back it wasn’t a sigh of relief, it was more of just happiness to see him back, proud of him.”
The comeback was a splashing success. He romped in the Rebel over a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, winning by 6 and one-quarter lengths. Then he clobbered the field by eight lengths in the Arkansas Derby three weeks before the Derby.
Sent off as the Derby favourite, American Pharoah struggled most of the way in third place, then fought for the lead coming out of the far turn. He overtook stablemate Dortmund, then outduelled Firing Line and won by a length. If nothing else, it showed American Pharoah could still win despite not running his best race.
“The sign of a great horse is one that has everything go against him and still wins,” Ahmed Zayat said.
Baffert won’t argue. He loves what he sees.
“As always, he just floats over the track,” the five-time Preakness winning trainer said Thursday after American Pharoah and stablemate Dortmund galloped around Pimlico Race Course for the first time. “He’s a very sound and healthy horse. He just moves over the ground really well. He’s just brilliant. Does everything so effortlessly.”

0,"Sit Less, Live Longer?","If people need motivation to get up from their office chairs or couches and become less sedentary, two useful new studies could provide the impetus. One found that sitting less can slow the aging process within cells, and the other helpfully underscores that standing up — even if you are standing still — can be good for you as well.

For most of us nowadays, sitting is our most common waking activity, with many of us sitting for eight hours or more every day. Even people who exercise for an hour or so tend to spend most of the remaining hours of the day in a chair.

The health consequences of this sedentariness are well-documented. Past studies have found that the more hours that people spend sitting, the more likely they are to develop diabetes, heart disease and other conditions, and potentially to die prematurely — even if they exercise regularly.

But most of these studies were associational, meaning that they found a link between sitting and illness, but could not prove whether or how sitting actually causes ill health.

So for the most groundbreaking of the new studies, which was published this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, scientists in Sweden decided to mount an actual experiment, in which they would alter the amount of time that people spent exercising and sitting, and track certain physiological results. In particular, with this experiment, the scientists were interested in whether changes in sedentary time would affect people’s telomeres.

If you are unfamiliar with the componentry of your genes, telomeres are the tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands. They shorten and fray as a cell ages, although the process is not strictly chronological. Obesity, illness and other conditions can accelerate the shortening, causing cells to age prematurely, while some evidence suggests that healthy lifestyles may preserve telomere length, delaying cell aging.

For the new experiment, the Swedish scientists recruited a group of sedentary, overweight men and women, all aged 68, and drew blood, in order to measure the length of telomeres in the volunteers’ white blood cells. Then half of the volunteers began an individualized, moderate exercise program, designed to improve their general health. They also were advised to sit less.

The other volunteers were told to continue with their normal lives, although the scientists urged them to try to lose weight and be healthy, without offering any specific methods.

After six months, the volunteers all returned for a second blood draw and to complete questionnaires about their daily activities. These showed that those in the exercise group were, not surprisingly, exercising more than they had been previously. But they were also, for the most part, sitting substantially less than before.

And when the scientists compared telomeres, they found that the telomeres in the volunteers who were sitting the least had lengthened. Their cells seemed to be growing physiologically younger.

Meanwhile, in the control group telomeres generally were shorter than they had been six months before.

But perhaps most interesting, there was little correlation between exercise and telomere length. In fact, the volunteers in the exercise group who had worked out the most during the past six months tended now to have slightly less lengthening and even some shortening, compared to those who had exercised less but stood up more.

Reducing sedentary time had lengthened telomeres, the scientists concluded, while exercising had played little role.

Exactly what the volunteers did in lieu of sitting is impossible to say with precision, said Per Sjögren, a professor of public health at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led the study, because the researchers did not track their volunteers’ movement patterns with monitors. But “it’s most likely,” he said, that “sitting time was predominantly replaced with low-intensity activities,” and in particular with time spent standing up.

Which makes the second new study of sedentary behavior particularly relevant. Standing is not, after all, physically demanding for most people, and some scientists have questioned whether merely standing up — without also moving about and walking — is sufficiently healthy or if standing merely replaces one type of sedentariness with another.

If so, standing could be expected to increase health problems and premature death, as sitting has been shown to do.

To find out whether that situation held true, Peter Katzmarzyk, a professor of public health at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., and an expert on sedentary behavior, turned to a large database of self-reported information about physical activity among Canadian adults. He noted the amount of time that the men and women had reported standing on most days over the course of a decade or more and crosschecked that data with death records, to see whether people who stood more died younger.

The results, published in May in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, are soothing if predictable. Dr. Katzmarzyk found no link between standing and premature death. Rather, as he writes in the study, “mortality rates declined at higher levels of standing,” suggesting that standing is not sedentary or hazardous, a conclusion with which our telomeres would likely concur.",Health/Science,Health,New York Times,09-17-2015,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/sit-less-live-longer/,10-20-2015
0,Fatal Accidents as a Global Health Crisis,"Worried about what to worry about? Accidents should move higher up your list.

Worldwide, road injuries kill more people than AIDS. Falls kill nearly three times as many people as brain cancer. Drowning claims more lives than mothers dying in childbirth. Both fire and poisonings have many times more fatal victims than natural disasters. In 2013, the combined death toll from all unintentional injuries was 3.5 million people. Only heart disease and stroke were greater killers.

These findings, published late last year in the British medical journal The Lancet, are from the “Global Burden of Disease” study, an international collaboration led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which tracks the annual toll of 240 causes of death for men and women in 20 age groups across 188 countries. The study isn't mere morbid fascination. Look beneath the top-level results and you also see huge variations among countries that are economic peers. This is actually encouraging news: It means that some countries have figured out a much better way to curb accidental deaths — and that other countries might be able to follow suit.

In France and Spain, according to the study’s authors, people die from transport injuries at roughly the same rate, but the French are twice as likely to die from falls, even when you adjust for the country’s older population. In Britain and the United States, deaths from falls are almost equivalent, but Americans are twice as likely to die from poisonings, again adjusted for age differences. Why?

If Russia could emulate Brazil, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from fire by 80 percent. If India could copy China, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from drowning by 30 percent. How?

The Global Burden of Disease study does not answer these questions directly, but it makes clear where to start looking for best practices. Individual countries can see in what areas they’re leading or lagging, often for the first time, then look to peers for advice or vice versa. Injury prevention may get one of the biggest boosts because global public health leaders have often ignored injuries as health risks, focusing instead on major diseases.

Take drowning. For decades, it has been one of the 20 biggest killers worldwide, but the World Health Organization issued its first report dedicated to drowning only in November 2014.

Effective prevention strategies include teaching swimming, providing life jackets, fencing off open water and training emergency medical responders. Drowning deaths also tend to decline as countries urbanize and when income and education increase. China, which both urbanized and started prevention programs, saw drowning deaths plunge from 190,000 in 1990 to 64,000 in 2013, Global Burden found. In India, drowning deaths barely budged, falling from an estimated 91,000 to 88,000 in the same period. David Meddings, an epidemiologist who was executive editor of the W.H.O. report, noted that China’s gains may partly reflect changes in the way deaths are reported, but that the improvement was still powerful.

“I don’t know why in India there has been economic development but drowning has not declined,” Dr. Meddings said.

Progress in reducing the 237,000 global deaths a year from fire is equally variable. It makes sense that more Russians than Brazilians die from fire: Russia has fearsome winters, and many fires are caused by heaters. But climate does not explain why the age-standardized death rate from fire was halved between 1990 and 2013 in Brazil, according to Global Burden figures, while in Russia, where more than 10,000 people die every year from fire, it did not decline at all.

“Outdated infrastructure” — wooden buildings with barred windows and sparking heaters — “is the major cause,” said Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow and a contributor to the new report. “Every winter, we have had cases where small hospitals or rural facilities for aged people were destroyed by fire. Dozens of people died in one moment.”

Show policy makers the larger data and what other countries are doing, Dr. Vlassov said, and there’s a better chance they will take appropriate action. “For example,” he said, “in Russia, very strong legislation was introduced in relation to smoking almost two years ago. Smoking in public places almost disappeared.”

Poisonings kill fewer people than drowning or fire worldwide — about 98,000 in 2013 — but are still a major health threat, claiming roughly 2,200 lives annually in the United States alone, according to Global Burden data. The puzzle is why the age-standardized death rate from poisonings in the United States is so much higher than in Britain.

“Is it because we have more availability of things that other countries have locked down?” said Jay Schauben, a clinical toxicologist, director of the Florida/USVI Poison Information Center in Jacksonville, and president of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. “Is it we sell things here that other countries have banned? Is it a difference in the health care system, or because people are afraid of seeking health care because of the cost, and therefore they stay at home and die? Is it a difference in the population and behavioral use patterns?”

Any one — or all — of these factors could explain the vastly different poisoning numbers, said Dr. Schauben, who is unaffiliated with the Global Burden of Disease study. So could disparate standards for reporting cause of death. “How many of the unknown deaths do the medical examiners pursue down to the level of determining whether it’s a poisoning death?” he said.

Dr. Schauben notes that international associations of clinical toxicologists meet together annually to compare protocols and patient outcomes, but that a comprehensive tally of national and international poisoning fatalities is new and that many poisoning victims never reach a hospital or poison control center. “This is the first time I’ve seen the death rates,” he said. “Poison centers only know about cases that are reported to us.”

The Global Burden study exists, in part, to provide this kind of all-encompassing view of global, regional and national health, as well as to track progress or setbacks place by place, population by population. The project, which includes more than 1,000 scientists in 106 countries, began in the 1990s at the World Bank and World Health Organization and is now led by independent academic scientists with major funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The new article in The Lancet is intended to be the first of a series of annual updates on death, disability and risk factors (like alcohol abuse, air pollution or lack of physical activity), providing the health equivalent of leading economic indicators. Where data on causes of death is sparse, the Global Burden team fills in the gaps as best it can with statistical modeling. The findings are therefore provisional — the best available evidence, not the final word. Still, broad trends suggest that accident prevention continues to be neglected as a public health issue worldwide.

The largest category of fatal accidents is transport injuries. In 1990, according to Global Burden figures, these were the 10th-leading global killer. By 2013, they were fifth, ahead of malaria, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis or any kind of cancer. In part, this is because of progress against disease. But it also because as incomes have risen worldwide, more people are buying — and crashing — motorbikes and cars.

Research on transport injury prevention shows that collective action is as important as individual efforts. Motorcycle helmets, car seatbelts and sober drivers are important, but so are safe vehicles, consistent law enforcement and reliable infrastructure. At stake are the lives of more than 1.4 million people who die annually in transit.

The World Bank has made reducing transport deaths a major investment priority, and Michael Bloomberg is the leading philanthropist for global injury prevention efforts, as Bill Gates is for children’s vaccines. But no one tracks overall aid money to accident prevention, even though unintentional injuries cause 6.36 percent of global deaths.

If public health leaders are to catch up on accident prevention, the Global Burden of Disease study findings can help them see where and how.

“Now that somebody’s done the work and we recognize that there’s a difference we may not have seen before, we can go to work and ask why,” Dr. Schauben said",Health/Science,Health,New York Times,02-16-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/upshot/fatal-accidents-as-a-global-health-crisis.html,10-20-2015
0,Shorter Stature May Pose Higher Risk of Heart Disease,"To the surprise of researchers who had thought the very notion a joke, an international consortium of investigators reported on Wednesday that shorter stature increases the risk of heart disease.

After gathering genetic data from nearly 200,000 men and women worldwide, the investigators found that each extra 2.5 inches of height brings a 13.5 percent reduction in heart disease risk. The relationship is present throughout the range of adult heights.

A person who is five feet tall has a 30 percent greater chance of developing heart disease than someone who is 5 feet 6, said a lead author of the new study, Sir Nilesh Samani, a professor of cardiology at the University of Leicester in England.

Of course, the increased risk pales in comparison to that caused by smoking, which elevates the odds of getting heart disease by 200 to 300 percent.

There is nothing people can do about their height, but the researchers hope the finding will lead to the discovery of new links to heart disease. The paper was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

No one was more surprised by the result than heart disease experts, although they have known about a purported association between height and heart disease for more than half a century. It was first pointed out in 1951 by Dr. Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist who was President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s physician.

He observed that 97 men and three women who had a heart attack before age 40 and were admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital were two inches shorter on average than 146 healthy men.

Since then, experts have noted that shorter people are more likely to get heart disease in a variety of populations and ethnic groups, even after accounting for such risk factors as smoking and cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. But few researchers took the finding seriously.

Height was just a marker for some other problem causing heart disease, most scientists said — perhaps a poor diet, or infectious diseases in childhood that led to a lifelong weakness of the heart.

“This idea that shorter stature is associated with coronary artery disease is something we would laugh about,” said Dr. Michael Lauer, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. “We would think about it as yet another example of epidemiology going amok.”

Dr. Samani and his colleagues realized that if there was a real link, genetic variations that resulted in short stature would also result in a greater risk of heart disease.

Previous research had identified 180 genetic variants that control height. To find out if those variants also affected heart disease risk, Dr. Samani and his colleagues examined the genetic profiles of more than 200,000 people whose DNA had been analyzed in a variety of other studies.

People with the genetic variants were more prone to heart disease, the scientists found. But what was the connection? Did the genes controlling height also affect obesity, diabetes or blood pressure?

Dr. Samani and his colleagues found just one link, and it was a very small one: The genetic variants associated with shorter stature also were linked to slightly higher levels of LDL, the form of cholesterol that increases heart disease risk, and to slightly higher levels of triglycerides, blood fats that are also a risk.

But that was not enough to account for all of the increased risk, noted Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, an author of the paper and director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. The rest, the researchers speculated, may come from poorly understood mechanisms, governed by height genes, that control the development of both blood vessels and bones.

Not everyone is impressed by the new report. Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of deCODE Genetics, said the increase in heart disease risk was real but so small as to be not very meaningful. “It’s a weak effect,” he said.

Others, like Dr. Lauer, find the new report an exciting taste of the science to come. Until recently, heart disease research focused on factors that greatly increase risk, like cholesterol levels. Research into the genetic underpinnings of disease may point to more “low-hanging fruit” in “other orchards we haven’t seen,” Dr. Lauer said.

Studies of huge DNA databases, like the new research, show the power of genetics to resolve questions that had seemed unanswerable.

“The Achilles’ heel of epidemiology has been the inability to distinguish between associations that are correlations and those that are causal,” Dr. Lauer said. Until now, the only way to do that was through large, expensive and time-consuming randomized controlled clinical trials.

For example, the Women’s Health Initiative studied whether taking hormones after menopause could reduce the risk of heart disease, which seemed well established. Thousands of women were told to take hormones after menopause, or not to. After years of study and millions of dollars, the result was clear: The hormones did not protect against heart disease.

Of course, no randomized trial can test whether height is linked to heart disease risk. But genetic variations are distributed at random in populations, and genes are not affected by lifestyle or environmental factors that have to be accounted for when researchers analyze data they get by simply observing populations.

In a sense, Dr. Lauer said, we are nature’s random experiments.",Health/Science,Health,New York Times,04-08-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/health/shorter-stature-may-pose-higher-risk-of-heart-disease.html,10-20-2015
0,"Drug Prices Soar, Prompting Calls for Justification","As complaints grow about exorbitant drug prices, pharmaceutical companies are coming under pressure to disclose the development costs and profits of those medicines and the rationale for charging what they do.

So-called pharmaceutical cost transparency bills have been introduced in at least six state legislatures in the last year, aiming to make drug companies justify their prices, which are often attributed to high research and development costs.

“If a prescription drug demands an outrageous price tag, the public, insurers and federal, state and local governments should have access to the information that supposedly justifies the cost,” says the preamble of a bill introduced in the New York State Senate in May.

In an article being published Thursday, more than 100 prominent oncologists called for support of a grass-roots movement to stem the rapid increases of prices of cancer drugs, including by letting Medicare negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and letting patients import less expensive medicines from Canada.

“There is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices,” the doctors wrote in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. “This raises the question of whether current pricing of cancer drugs is based on reasonable expectation of return on investment or whether it is based on what prices the market can bear.”

Pressure is mounting from elsewhere as well. The top Republican and Democrat on the United States Senate Finance Committee last year demanded detailed cost data from Gilead Sciences, whose hepatitis C drugs, which cost $1,000 a pill or more, have strained the budgets of state and federal health programs. The U.A.W. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust tried to make Gilead, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Celgene and other companies report to their shareholders more about how they set prices and the risks to their businesses from resistance to high drug prices.

The trust cited the more than $300,000 per year price of Vertex’s cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and roughly $150,000 for Celgene’s cancer drug Revlimid.

Even former President Bill Clinton, in a speech to pharmaceutical executives in Philadelphia last month, said it would be in the industry’s best interest to say more about its costs and pricing.

“Explain, explain, explain and disclose, disclose, disclose,” Mr. Clinton said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. “Don’t expect everybody to love you, but at least they will hear your side of the story.”

The pharmaceutical industry has already had the veil lifted on various practices. Drug companies now have to report the payments, including meals and entertainment, that they make to doctors for research, consulting and giving promotional speeches. The companies have also had to disclose more results of their clinical trials and in some cases have started to provide raw data to outsiders.

It is unclear if cost and pricing will become the next such area. The state bills, which are supported by some health insurers and consumer groups, have not progressed. The two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have not reported the results of their inquiry. And shareholders of Gilead, Vertex and Celgene voted down the resolutions proposed by the U.A.W. trust, though the trust says it reached settlements with Eli Lilly and with two other drug companies it would not identify.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry trade groups say the transparency bills would be costly to comply with and would provide misleading information.

Even some people concerned about drug prices say that the cost to develop a particular drug has little to do with that drug’s price and that knowing such information will not keep prices down.

“The past R&D cost is really kind of a red herring,” said Len Nichols, a health care economist at George Mason University, referring to research and development. “The current revenue doesn’t pay for past R&D; it pays for current R&D.”

Prices for cancer drugs, some of which extend lives by only a couple of months, routinely exceed $100,000 a year, and some new ones exceed $150,000. And it is not unusual for the list prices of existing drugs to rise 10 percent or more year after year, far beyond the rate of inflation. The prices of older drugs for multiple sclerosis have risen from about $10,000 per year in the late 1990s to more than $60,000 now, according to a study, even as competition in the market has intensified with the introduction of new products.

Cost transparency bills have also been introduced in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

Three of the bills require disclosures for drugs costing $10,000 or more per year. The others have different criteria. Besides development costs, some of the bills would require disclosure of the costs of manufacturing, marketing and advertising. At least some of the bills also ask for a history of price increases, the profit attributable to the drug and how much a company spends in providing financial assistance to patients using the drug.

Two of the bills would allow the states to act on the information, not just require disclosure. Pennsylvania’s would allow insurers to refuse to pay for a drug if the manufacturer did not file the required report. In Massachusetts, a state commission would be able to set a maximum price for a drug if it determined that the price set by the manufacturer was significantly high compared with the benefits, costs or prices in other countries.

Most of the bills have not been acted upon, though hearings were held in California and Oregon.

The sponsor of the California bill, Assemblyman David Chiu, pulled it back shortly before a committee was to vote on it, apparently because it did not have sufficient support. The bill could be picked up again next year.

“This is a new topic for many of my colleagues to grapple with,” said Mr. Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco. He said the bill was necessary because “greater transparency leads to better policy results.”

Mitch Greenlick, a Democrat from Portland who is chairman of the Health Care Committee in Oregon’s House of Representatives, said the bill was prepared with input from the health insurance industry, but was “not ready for prime time.” He added that the issue would be further studied.

“What are we going to do with that information?” he said. “It’s interesting to have, I suppose, but the drug companies are shameless, and they charge what they can get away with.”

Insurers and consumer groups told the Oregon Legislature that more disclosure was needed because the state had to decide whether to pay for certain drugs. Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry said the bill was unfair and would discourage industry investment in Oregon.

Lori Reilly, executive vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry’s main trade group, said it was misleading to look only at the cost of developing a particular drug because that ignored the money spent on the drugs that fail during development. Only about 12 percent of drugs tested in people reach the market, she said.

Ms. Reilly said that publicly traded drug companies already disclosed their overall research and development costs, as well as other financial information. She also said that focusing on costs ignored the value of the drugs. Some drugs, for instance, can save money for the health system over all by keeping people out of the hospital, she said.

Pharmaceutical executives do not typically tie the price of any particular drug to its development cost. But they do say that their sales have to recoup their investment in research and development if the companies are to stay in business.

They often cite the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, which last year said companies spent an average of $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market, up from an estimate of $800 million in 2003. That includes the cost of failures. And almost half the figure is opportunity cost, the amount a company might have earned if it had invested money elsewhere rather than spending it on drug development.

Critics are skeptical of that figure, saying that the Tufts center gets funding from the pharmaceutical industry and uses data supplied by the drug companies, but does not disclose which drugs are used as the basis of the estimates.

Pharmaceutical executives often say they price the drugs based on the value they provide, though often a detailed explanation of that is not provided. In many cases, it appears, the price of new drugs is set in comparison to rival drugs already on the market, and usually a bit higher. Companies then can raise their prices for the older drugs.

“We all look at each other and keep pace with each other,” said a director of one multiple sclerosis drug developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Honestly, there is no science to it.”

John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a group of insurers, consumer organizations, labor unions and employers concerned about drug prices, said his group hoped to introduce transparency legislation in Congress, but aimed at determining how drug companies estimate the value of their drugs, not the research and development costs.

“The industry has used R&D costs for the justification, but anyone who is reasonably sophisticated understands those are sunk costs and have little to do with pricing,” Mr. Rother said. “The more important information is any calculation of value. If the drug actually cures people, then what costs in health care are you saving?”

Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School and critic of some drug company practices, said the industry “has brought this on itself by charging prices that are so astonishing, it makes citizens wonder, ‘Where did this figure come from?’ ”",Health/Science,Health,New York Times,07-23-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/business/drug-companies-pushed-from-far-and-wide-to-explain-high-prices.html,10-20-2015
0,"Americans Are
Finally Eating Less","After decades of worsening diets and sharp increases in obesity, Americans’
eating habits have begun changing for the better.
Calories consumed daily by the typical American adult, which peaked
around 2003, are in the midst of their first sustained decline since federal
statistics began to track the subject, more than 40 years ago. The number of
calories that the average American child takes in daily has fallen even more —
by at least 9 percent.
The declines cut across most major demographic groups — including
higher- and lower-income families, and blacks and whites — though they vary
somewhat by group.
In the most striking shift, the amount of full-calorie soda drunk by the
average American has dropped 25 percent since the late 1990s.
As calorie consumption has declined, obesity rates appear to have stopped
rising for adults and school-aged children and have come down for the
youngest children, suggesting the calorie reductions are making a difference.
The reversal appears to stem from people’s growing realization that they
were harming their health by eating and drinking too much. The awareness
began to build in the late 1990s, thanks to a burst of scientific research about
the costs of obesity, and to public health campaigns in recent years.
The encouraging data does not mean an end to the obesity epidemic:
More than a third of American adults are still considered obese, putting them
at increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Americans are still
eating far too few fruits and vegetables and far too much junk food, even if
they are eating somewhat less of it, experts say.
But the changes in eating habits suggest that what once seemed an
inexorable decline in health may finally be changing course. Since the mid-
1970s, when American eating habits began to rapidly change, calorie
consumption had been on a near-steady incline.
“I think people are hearing the message, and diet is slowly improving,”
said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition
Science and Policy at Tufts University.
Barry Popkin, a University of North Carolina professor who has studied
food data extensively, described the development as a “turning point.
There is no perfect way to measure American calorie consumption. But
three large sources of data about diet all point in the same direction. Detailed
daily food diaries tracked by government researchers, data from food bar
codes and estimates of food production all show reductions in the calories
consumed by the average American since the early 2000s. Those signals, along
with the flattening of the national obesity rate, have convinced many public
health researchers that the changes are meaningful.
The eating changes have been the most substantial in households with
children. Becky Lopes-Filho’s 4-year-old son, Sebastian, has always been at
the top of the growth chart for weight. Ms. Lopes-Filho, 35, is the operations
manager of a pizzeria in Cambridge, Mass., and her son, like her, loves food.
As he has gotten older, she has grown more concerned about his cravings for
sweets. Instead of a cookie every day now, she said, she has been trying to limit
him to one a week. “If he was given access, he would just go nuts,” she said.
“He, I think, would tend to be a super obese kid.”
There is no single moment when American attitudes toward eating
changed, but researchers point to a 1999 study as a breakthrough. That year,
researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a
paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association that turned into
something of a blockbuster.
The paper included bright blue maps illustrating worsening obesity rates
in the 1980s and 1990s in all 50 states. Researchers knew the obesity rate was
rising, but Dr. Ali Mokdad, the paper’s lead author, said that when he
presented the maps at conferences, even the experts were gasping. A year
later, he published another paper, with a similar set of maps, showing a related
explosion in diabetes diagnoses. “People became more aware of it in a very
visual and impactful way,” said Hank Cardello, a former food industry
executive who is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
policy center. “That created a lot of attention and concern.”
Shortly afterward, the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, issued a report
— “Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity” —
modeled on the famous 1964 surgeon general’s report on tobacco. The 2001
report summarized the increasing evidence that obesity was a risk factor for
several chronic diseases, and said controlling children’s weight should be a
priority, to prevent the onset of obesity-related illnesses.
Slowly, the messages appear to have sunk in with the public. By 2003, 60
percent of Americans said they wanted to lose weight, according to Gallup, up
from 52 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in the 1950s.
The Obama administration has increased pressure. The Affordable Care
Act, passed in 2010, required chain restaurants to publish the calorie content
of their meals. The federal government has also changed requirements,
making school lunches healthier, although the effort has created some
backlash.
Several cities have gone further. Philadelphia subsidizes produce
purchases for the poor. New York limits the kind of food available in day care
centers. Berkeley, Calif., last year became the first city in the United States to
tax sugar-sweetened beverages. The evidence for the effectiveness of these
interventions is mixed, but their popularity reflects public health officials’
emphasis on diet and obesity.
Still, the timeline of the calorie declines suggests that people started
eating a little less before policy makers got involved. That follows the pattern
for tobacco use, which peaked right around the time of the 1964 surgeon
general’s report. The policy changes that many credit with the country’s sharp
reductions in smoking — advertising bans, warning labels, taxes and
restrictions on smoking in public — came later, accelerating change after
attitudes had already begun to shift.
The anti-obesity public health campaigns have focused on one subject
more than any other: beverages.
Anti-soda messages hit their target. Americans, on average, purchased
about 40 gallons of full-calorie soda a year in 1998, according to sales data
from the industry trade publication Beverage Digest analyzed by the Center for
Science in the Public Interest. That fell to 30 gallons in 2014, about the level
that Americans bought in 1980, before the obesity rates took off.
“I think the attitude more and more in this country is that it’s not a good
idea to consume a lot of soda,” said Dr. Satcher, now a professor at the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.
Beverage companies have reacted by marketing diet drinks and investing
heavily in new products, including iced teas and flavored water. “A lot of the
changes we are seeing are consumer-driven,” said John Sicher, Beverage
Digest’s publisher.
Outside of beverages, there are few clear trends. Experts who have
examined the data say the reductions do not mean that Americans are flocking
to farmer’s markets and abandoning fast food. Consumption of fruits and
vegetables remains low; consumption of desserts remains high. Instead,
people appear to be eating a little less of everything. Although consumption in
nearly every category has been “cut some,” said Mr. Popkin, “the food part of
our diet is horrendous and remains horrendous.”
The calorie reductions are seen across nearly every demographic group,
but not equally. White families have reduced their calorie consumption more
than black and Hispanic families. Most starkly, families with children have cut
back more than households with adults living alone, further evidence, experts
say, that the public health emphasis on childhood obesity is driving the
changes.
Ms. Lopes-Filho said she’s seen how her concern about her son’s diet has
subtly changed her own eating habits. “I think I’m still sneaking stuff behind
his back, but I have tried to change,” she said. “I haven’t been drinking soda or
doing a lot of sugary drinks in a while, but all because of him — because I know
that if I have it, he’s going to want it. And there’s really no fair way to say, ‘No,
this is Mommy’s drink.’ ”
Perhaps the biggest caveat to the trend is that it does not appear to extend
to the very heaviest Americans. Among the most overweight people, weight
and waist circumference have all continued rising in recent years.
The recent calorie reductions appear to be good news, but they, alone, will
not be enough to reverse the obesity epidemic. A paper by Kevin Hall, a
researcher at the National Institutes of Health, estimated that for Americans
to return to the body weights of 1978 by 2020, an average adult would need to
reduce calorie consumption by 220 calories a day. The recent reductions
represent just a fraction of that change.
“This was like a freight train going downhill without brakes,” Kelly
Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, said.
“Anything slowing it down is good.”

0,Clara Hughes didn’t even tell her mom she was depressed,"When Olympian Clara Hughes agreed to speak publicly for the first time in 2010 about her experience with depression, she wasn’t sure anyone would care. But one of the people closest to Hughes didn’t know about her struggle more than 10 years after she sought help.
“My mother found out on TV,” said Hughes, 42.
Hughes, one of few athletes who have competed in both the summer and Winter Olympics, became a spokesperson for Bell in 2010, when the company announced it was committing $50 million to mental health initiatives.
“I had such a hard time with it that I didn’t talk to her for three months after the campaign because I felt so bad that I hadn’t told her,” said Hughes, who’ll be in Toronto on Tuesday for a screening of a documentary about her epic 2010 cycling journey to raise the problem’s profile.
A history of mental illness in her family is what kept Hughes from sharing her diagnosis with her mother. Hughes’ sister suffered from bipolar disorder and depression while her father struggled with addiction. With her mother was trying to manage it all, Hughes said she didn’t want to be a burden.
While training as a cyclist in the mid-1990s, Hughes started to sink into depression, although she didn’t call it that at the time.
“No matter what I won, I still had this void and darkness and often times feelings of self-loathing and worthlessness inside,” she said.
Even after bringing home two bronze medals from the Atlanta summer games in 1996, the feelings persisted and Hughes spiralled into depression for the next two years. At a training camp the winter after returning from Atlanta, a national team doctor talked to Hughes about depression and suggested ways to get help.
“I walked out the meeting thinking, you’re not going to tell me what’s wrong with me, there’s nothing wrong with me. I’m a great athlete, I’ll get through this — I’ll just train harder,” she said.
But the reality was she couldn’t focus — barely able to race her bike and crashing it when she did.
“I was in such a fog,” said Hughes.
When she finally sought support, it was there for her but she realizes not everyone is so lucky. That’s why she decided to speak up about her own struggle after hearing that Bell, a sponsor for many years, was launching a charitable campaign focusing on mental illness in 2010.
She hopes having more public figures come forward with their experiences with mental illness will help more “real people” share their stories.
Last year, Hughes completed a cycling journey spanning 110 days and covering more than 11,000 kilometres across Canada to bring more attention to the issue. The documentary on the ride, Clara’s Big Ride, will be aired on CTV on Bell Let’s Talk day, on Wednesday.
One day of the year, Bell adds five cents to existing funds dedicated to mental illness programs for every text message and mobile and long distance call made by Bell customers. A year after its launch, the company included social media as part of the campaign to let those who didn’t have Bell phones participate.
Since the first Let’s Talk day in 2011, $17.5 million has been added to the pot, totalling a $67.5 million commitment from Bell.
“Mental health as a sector has been, I believe, underfunded systematically forever,” said chair of the initiative, Mary Deacon.
Bell has spent about $10 million a year of that money supporting over 250 organizations across the country — from psychiatric units in hospitals to community-based programs, according to Deacon.
Dismantling stigma is high on her agenda.
“The more we talk as individuals and communities, the more this will become a priority issue for action,” Deacon said.
But talking is not always as easy as it seems, even for Olympians. Hughes said when she finally faced her mother, she simply asked Hughes why she didn’t tell her before.
“One of the biggest regrets that I have is not talking to my mom about it and letting her support me,” said Hughes.",Health/Science,Health,Toronto Star,01-25-2015,http://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2015/01/25/olympian-didnt-even-tell-her-mom-she-was-depressed.html,10-20-2015
0,Participaction report urges parents to get their kids outside,"Canadian kids are woefully inactive and should be encouraged to play in natural settings and take risks, according to an annual report released Tuesday.
The Participaction Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth says parents who are overprotective of their child’s play, or keep them indoors because it’s perceived to be safer, are actually hurting their child’s long-term health.
“Get kids outside,” says Dr. Mark Tremblay, chief scientific officer of the report and director of the Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research Group at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (HALO-CHEO).
“They will be more active as a result and less sedentary ... And, a higher danger lurks on the Internet, indoors.”
Among the grades in the report card was a D minus for overall physical activity, in part because just nine per cent of 5- to 17-year-olds meet daily recommendations of at least one hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. (The grade remains unchanged for three years in a row.) By comparison, 70 per cent of 3- and 4-year-olds get the recommended 180 minutes a day of activity.
The report card, titled The Biggest Risk is Keeping Kids Indoors, is based on data from various sources, including peer-reviewed research. For the first time in 11 years, the report includes a position statement developed by HALO-CHEO and 12 other organizations, which promotes active outdoor play. It also contains recommendations aimed at, for instance, parents, educators, health professionals, municipalities, even attorneys general.
Toronto mom Jaimie Cowles, whose children spend as much time playing outdoors as possible, needs no convincing of its benefits. While at the park, she doesn’t really supervise her kids, Hanna, 7, and Ben, 5. Instead, she lets them explore and play on their own, which builds social skills and self-assurance.
“It’s allowed them to take small risks that will give them the tools they need to take bigger risks later,” says Cowles. “They can assess what’s going to be ‘dangerous’ — obviously, we’re not exposing them to actual danger but what they perceive to be dangerous.”
Tremblay says parents who over-supervise their children are minimizing their child’s resiliency, decision-making capabilities and executive functioning.
“These are, of course, the features that we want our kids to develop. And in order for them to develop, you’ve got to allow them to take some risks. ”
Sure, your kid may come home with a scraped knee, he says, adding serious injuries happen periodically and catastrophic injuries occur very rarely. But that’s no justification for over-supervising kids or prohibiting active outdoor play because the long-term consequences of sedentary behaviour are a variety of mental and physical health issues, including the development of heart disease, obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.
“Sanitizing and bubble wrapping the entire population to prevent what, in many cases is the unpreventable, is sacrificing the whole population,” he says. “Mental and emotional health issues are on the rise like crazy now because kids have no ability to deal with things. We’ve never given them a chance .”
Tremblay, who is 54, would like to see a shift away from so-called helicopter-parenting, to the kind of parenting he and many adults grew up with, which some refer to as free-range parenting. His childhood was filled with long days spent discovering the outdoors with other kids, climbing trees, biking on hills and building forts.
“We’re actually compromising healthy child development by hovering over them so much, keeping them sanitized and indoors, with the misguided belief that that’s the safest thing for them.”",Health/Science,Health,Toronto Star,06-09-2015,http://www.thestar.com/life/2015/06/09/participaction-report-urges-parents-to-get-their-kids-outside.html,10-20-2015
0,"'Female Viagra' okayed in U.S., may come to Canada","“If the manufacturer really wanted to get it to the market in Canada they would do it,” Cassels said. “If they’ve been able to overcome the hurdles of the FDA, Health Canada is going to be a cakewalk.”
According to Sprout, HSDD affects up to one in 10 American women. It’s characterized as an unexplained persistent lack of sexual thoughts, fantasies, responsiveness and desire to engage in sex, which causes personal distress.
Addyi, which is taken daily, can cause severely low blood pressure and loss of consciousness – risks that increase if consumed with alcohol or certain medicines. Common adverse reactions include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dry mouth.
FDA approval was, in part, based on three randomized trials involving about 2,400 premenopausal women with HSDD. On average, Addyi boosted the number of “satisfying sexual events” from 0.5 to one additional event per month, as compared with those who took the placebo.
The drug has overcome numerous hurdles, opposition and criticism. It was rejected by the FDA as a desire drug in 2010 and 2013. Then Sprout and other drug companies with sexual pharmaceuticals in the pipeline sponsored the campaign Even the Score. It resembled a grassroots, social media campaign accusing the FDA of sexism for not having approved this drug for women, while claiming men had similar drugs to help them treat male sexual dysfunction.
“Even the Score. . . It’s time to level the playing field when it comes to the treatment of women’s sexual dysfunction,” reads the campaign’s website.
Thea Cacchioni, an assistant professor of women’s studies at the University of Victoria who testified before the FDA in 2010 and was critical of the drug, suspects public pressure influenced the agency’s most recent decision. In addition to Even the Score, there was compelling testimony at the most recent FDA hearing.
“There were many patients and doctors, who were sponsored by Sprout, and they gave very emotional pleas and spoke a lot about the demand for the drug,” Cacchioni said in an interview. “The FDA panel members barely had anything positive to say about the drug.”
Cacchioni has been studying the race by pharmaceutical companies to launch a sexual drug for women for years and recently published the book Big Pharma, Women, and the Labour of Love.
She doesn’t believe that the benefits of Addyi, when weighed against its risks, have been proven, particularly when compared with the benefits of sex therapy, sex education and sex counselling. She’s also concerned that the drug was tested on a young and healthy population – the average age of the participants in the trials was 36 – saying “we don’t know what a drug is really going to do until it goes out into a wider population.”
Her comments are echoed, in part, by Cassels. “When you take a drug and give it to healthy people, you have to be absolutely certain that drug is not going to have any adverse effect. And, in the clinical studies of this drug, we’ve seen that there are people being harmed by it.”
Cassels, who along with Ray Moynihan co-wrote Selling Sickness: How the World’s Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies Are Turning Us All Into Patients, believes the industry has created disorders, such as HSDD, in an effort to market drugs.
“The main hurdle (for approval) was to try and define the disease,” Cassels said. “And I think (Sprout) bamboozled the FDA into considering this a disease.”
Cassels said it’s a misnomer to refer to Addyi as the female Viagra or pink Viagra because Viagra has nothing to do with desire. Rather, it’s aimed at increasing blood flow to the genitals for men.
At the extreme end, he believes there are women who aren’t interested in having sex. But Cassels suspects that’s not who the drug maker will target.
“This drug will be marketed to everyone who doesn’t want to have sex, for whatever reason – the ‘Not tonight, honey, I have a headache’ market.
“The market has been shaped around turning lack of desire into a disease and I think it’s highly problematic,” Cassels said.
“This idea that you can tamper with and increase sexual desire with a pill – this is the brave new world.”",Health/Science,Health,Toronto Star,08-19-2015,http://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/19/female-viagra-okayed-in-us-may-come-to-canada.html,10-20-2015
0,"Four measles cases confirmed in Toronto, no known link or source case","Public health officials are urging Torontonians to check their vaccination records after a measles outbreak with no known link between victims hit the city Monday.
Lab tests confirmed four people, including two children under the age of 2 and two adults, are infected with the potentially deadly disease, Toronto Public Health announced. One was hospitalized, but officials would not release other health or personal details, citing privacy reasons.
“The message is that measles is circulating in Toronto,” said Dr. Lisa Berger, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “There has been spread somewhere.”
Berger said that in three of the four cases, the individuals had not been vaccinated against the disease. In the fourth case, the person received only one dose of the double-dose vaccination, she said.
None are from the same family and there is no source case, said Berger.
“It’s always concerning to me when we get cases of a disease that has been eliminated in Ontario,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, medical director of Immunization and Vaccine Preventable Diseases with Public Health Ontario.
The last endemic case of measles in Canada was in 1997, with recent outbreaks the result of imported viruses from endemic regions, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.
In Ontario, the number of reported cases per year has fluctuated from three to 22 over the past five years, said Deeks.
“Will I be surprised if we see subsequent cases from this? Absolutely not,” said Deeks.
The Toronto outbreak is the first in Ontario this year.
It comes just days after a measles outbreak that originated at Disneyland in December spread to 100 people.
Berger said none of the victims had travelled outside Toronto in the past 21 days, nor had they been in contact with anyone who had travelled.
Canadian children typically receive two doses of the combined measles vaccine — MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox) — which is more than 90 percent effective.
Deeks said that in Ontario, vaccination rates have hovered around 95 per cent for 17-year-olds for the past five years. However, Ontario has seen a “slight increase” of “conscientious objectors” to vaccines in recent years.
Jane Heffernan, associate professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at York University and director of the Centre for Disease Modelling, said people may oppose vaccinating children because the effects of diseases are less visible today than they once were.
“We don’t see very many cases now, and that may, in some people’s minds, sway them to be more hesitant towards having their children vaccinated … because it’s hard to assess the risk of infection when you don’t see it,” she said.
Controversial anti-vaccine movements have gained attention in recent years, notably after actress Jenny McCarthy linked vaccinations with her son’s autism, which is not supported by scientific evidence.
On Monday, Health Minister Eric Hoskins said parents who don’t get their children vaccinated for measles risk boosting the spread of the ""dangerous"" disease.
""Parents really need to look at the evidence ... we need to continue to educate the population,"" he told reporters. ""There are gains that can be made.""
Ontario children must be vaccinated against measles to attend school — however, parents may submit a statement of conscience or religious belief to exempt children from vaccine requirements.
Toronto Public Health is urging Torontonians to check their medical records to ensure they are fully vaccinated. People who show symptoms should call their health-care provider and notify medical offices before showing up.
Measles is a highly contagious, potentially fatal disease. Symptoms include a high fever, cold-like symptoms, sore eyes or sensitivity to light and a red rash that starts on the face and neck and spreads to the rest of the body. Serious cases can result in pneumonia, blindness, and encephalitis — swelling of the brain — which can lead to death.
Most people recover within 10 days.
The TPH investigation into the outbreak is ongoing, said Berger.

0,Protesters rally against sex-ed curriculum,"With the first day of school on the horizon, parents, children and concerned residents rallied at MPPs’ offices Wednesday morning to protest the Ontario government’s new sexual education curriculum.
In Toronto, more than 50 protesters showed up at Premier Kathleen Wynne’s office at Eglinton Ave. E. to voice their concerns.
Parents with young and school-aged children in tow climbed out of a school bus and stood in front of the office, fighting the sounds of nearby traffic with shouts of “shame” and calling on Wynne’s government to “let kids be kids.”
The protests were organized by Campaign Life Coalition, which opposes changes – the first in 17 years – made to the sex-ed curriculum. The demonstrators outside of Wynne’s office mostly consisted of Thorncliffe Parents Association supporters.
Campaign Life Coalition was hoping to see simultaneous demonstrations begin at 11 a.m. at the office of each of the province’s 107 MPPs in a bid to “stop radical sex ed,” according to its website.

At the Carlton St. office of Glen Murray, only three protesters showed up, two of whom worked in the same building as the Liberal MPP.
Four police officers attended the office in anticipation of a larger protest, which didn’t materialize.
One of the officers said two people had interrupted a news conference involving Murray around 10 a.m. at the Evergreen centre on Yonge St., but it wasn’t clear what they were shouting.
Outside Murray’s office, Sean Hart said he was encouraged to protest by the “mind control” of children in the government’s sex education curriculum, which he said was reminiscent of George Orwell’s 1984.
Wearing a bright safety vest and clutching a microphone, 11-year-old Manahil Khalil revved up the crowd outside of Wynne’s constituency office, calling on parents to take their kids out of school to make a stand.
It would be a way to protest the “dirty curriculum”, which she called “gross”.
According to Khalil, the type of detail in the new curriculum, which Khalil said she hasn’t read, is too much to be exposed to in the classroom.
“My parents they know the best for me and they’ll know what time I’ll be ready for this,” Khalil said.
A few protesters argued the Wynne government didn’t consult enough with parents in their community, and by so doing, disregarded their religious values.
It’s a big concern for Naz Ghani, who brought her two young children along to the rally. Ghani is worried the curriculum will edge out longstanding religious and cultural values in her family, which could cause arguments at home.
Ghani is also concerned about the portion of the curriculum about gender identity.
“We have our system that if she’s a girl then she is proud of being a girl, and if he’s a boy, he’s proud of being a boy,” she said, adding she is worried the gender identity section could lead to “confusion”.
Wendy Cassibault, a retired Toronto teacher who still works with high school youth, said the controversial snew curriculum is “indoctrination of children and it’s corrupt. It shouldn’t be imposing those values on our children — let them be children,” she said.",Health/Science,Health,Toronto Star,09-02-2015,http://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/09/02/live-sex-ed-curriculum-protests-planned-across-the-province.html,10-20-2015
0,Obama Vetoes Bill Pushing Pipeline Approval,"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Tuesday rejected an attempt by lawmakers to force his hand on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, using his veto pen to sweep aside one of the first major challenges to his authority by the new Republican Congress.

With no fanfare and a 104-word letter to the Senate, Mr. Obama vetoed legislation to authorize construction of a 1,179-mile pipeline that would carry 800,000 barrels of heavy petroleum a day from the oil sands of Alberta to ports and refineries on the Gulf Coast.

In exercising the unique power of the Oval Office for only the third time since his election in 2008, Mr. Obama accused lawmakers of seeking to circumvent the administration’s approval process for the pipeline by cutting short “consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest.”

By rejecting the legislation, Mr. Obama retains the right to make a final judgment on the pipeline on his own timeline. But he did little to calm the political debate over Keystone, which has become a symbol of the continuing struggle between environmentalists and conservatives.
 
Backers of the pipeline denounced Mr. Obama’s actions and vowed to keep fighting for its construction.

The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, called the president’s veto “a national embarrassment” and accused Mr. Obama of being “too close to environmental extremists” and “too invested in left-fringe politics.”

Environmentalists quickly hailed the decision, which they said clearly indicated Mr. Obama’s intention to reject the pipeline’s construction. The White House has said the president will decide whether to allow the pipeline when all of the environmental reviews are completed in the coming weeks.

“Republicans in Congress continued to waste everyone’s time with a bill destined to go nowhere, just to satisfy the agenda of their big oil allies,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. “The president has all the evidence he needs to reject Keystone XL now, and we are confident that he will.”

Since 2011, the proposed Keystone pipeline has emerged as a broader symbol of the partisan political clash over energy, climate change and the economy.

Most energy policy experts say the project will have a minimal impact on jobs and climate. But Republicans insist that the pipeline will increase employment by linking the United States to an energy supply from a friendly neighbor. Environmentalists say it will contribute to ecological destruction and damaging climate change.

Mr. Obama has hinted that he thinks both sides have inflated their arguments, but he has not said what he will decide.

In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama urged lawmakers to move past the pipeline debate, calling for passage of a comprehensive infrastructure plan. “Let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,” he said.

Republican leaders had promised to use the veto, which was expected, to denounce Mr. Obama as a partisan obstructionist. They made good on that promise minutes after the president’s veto message was read on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday.

“The fact he vetoed the bipartisan Keystone Pipeline in private shows how out of step he is with the priorities of the American people, who overwhelmingly support this vital jobs and infrastructure project,” Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.

In recent months, the environmental activists — who have spent years marching, protesting and getting arrested outside the White House in their quest to persuade Mr. Obama to reject the project — have said they are increasingly optimistic that their efforts will succeed.

“Hopefully the ongoing legislative charade has strengthened his commitment to do the right thing,” said Bill McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, which has led the campaign to urge Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline.

The debate began in 2008, when the TransCanada Corporation applied for a permit to construct the pipeline. The State Department is required to determine whether the pipeline is in the national interest, but the last word on whether the project will go forward ultimately rests with the president.

Mr. Obama has delayed making that decision until all the legal and environmental reviews of the process are completed. He has said a critical factor in his decision will be whether the project contributes to climate change.

more carbon pollution than conventionally extracted oil.

But the review said the pipeline was unlikely to contribute to a significant increase in planet-warming greenhouse gases because the fuel would probably be extracted from the oil sands and sold with or without construction of the pipeline.

This month, environmentalists pointed to a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency that they said proved that the pipeline could add to greenhouse gases.

The question of whether to build the pipeline comes as Mr. Obama hopes to make climate change policy a cornerstone of his legacy. This summer, the E.P.A. is expected to issue sweeping regulations to cut greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, a move experts say would have vastly more impact on the nation’s carbon footprint than construction of the Keystone pipeline.

In December, world leaders hope to sign a global United Nations accord in Paris that would commit every nation in the world to enacting plans to reduce its rates of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. In the coming months, countries are expected to begin putting forward those policies for cutting carbon emissions.

While the Keystone pipeline is not expected to be part of the United States climate change plan, a public presidential decision on the project could be interpreted as a message about Mr. Obama’s symbolic commitment to the issue of climate change.

Until that decision is made, however, both sides of the Keystone fight are stepping up their tactics. Environmental groups are planning more marches and White House petitions, while Republicans in Congress are looking for ways to bring the Keystone measure back to Mr. Obama’s desk.

Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who sponsored the Keystone bill, said he would consider adding language requiring construction of the pipeline to other legislation, such as spending bills to fund federal agencies, which could make a veto far more politically risky for Mr. Obama.

A final decision by the president could come soon. Last month, a court in Nebraska reached a verdict in a case about the pipeline’s route through the state, clearing the way for construction. And this month, final reviews of the pipeline by eight federal agencies were completed.

However, Mr. Obama is under no legal obligation to make a final decision, and there is no official timetable for a decision. He could approve or deny the project at any time — or leave the decision to the next president.",Health/Science,Environment,New York Times,02-25-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/us/politics/as-expected-obama-vetoes-keystone-xl-pipeline-bill.html,10-27-2015
0,"Pope Francis, in Sweeping Encyclical, Calls for Swift Action on Climate Change","VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Thursday called for a radical transformation of politics, economics and individual lifestyles to confront environmental degradation and climate change, blending a biting critique of consumerism and irresponsible development with a plea for swift and unified global action.

The vision that Francis outlined in a 184-page papal encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He describes relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment and says apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness are to blame.

The most vulnerable victims, he declares, are the world’s poorest people, who are being dislocated and disregarded.
Francis, the first pope from the developing world, used the encyclical — titled “Laudato Si’,” or “Praise Be to You” — to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He places most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity, while warning of an “unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us” if corrective action is not taken swiftly. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he says, and are obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis.

“Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods,” he writes. “It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.”

The Vatican released the encyclical at noon on Thursday, three days after an Italian magazine posted a leaked draft online, to the fury of Vatican officials. The breach led to speculation that opponents of Francis in the Vatican wanted to embarrass him by undermining the release.

Even so, religious figures, environmentalists, scientists, executives and elected officials around the world awaited the official release, and scheduled news conferences or issued statements afterward. News media interest was enormous, in part because of Francis’ global popularity, but also because of the intriguing coalition he is proposing between faith and science.

“Humanity is faced with a crucial challenge that requires the development of adequate policies, which, moreover, are currently being discussed on the global agenda,” Cardinal Peter Turkson said at a news conference at the Vatican. “Certainly, ‘Laudato Si’ ’ can and must have an impact on important and urgent decisions to be made in this area.”

Francis has made it clear that he hopes the encyclical will influence energy and economic policy and stir a global movement. He calls on ordinary people to press politicians for change. Catholic bishops and priests around the world are expected to discuss the encyclical in services on Sunday. But Francis is also reaching for a wider audience, asking in the document “to address every person living on this planet.”

Even before the encyclical, the pope’s stance against environmental destruction and his demand for global action had already thrilled many scientists. Advocates of policies to combat climate change have said they hoped that Francis could lend a “moral dimension” to the debate.

“Within the scientific community, there is almost a code of honor that you will never transgress the red line between pure analysis and moral issues,” said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and chairman of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But we are now in a situation where we have to think about the consequences of our insight for society.”

Francis has been sharply criticized by those who question or deny the established science of human-caused climate change, and also by some conservative Roman Catholics, who see the encyclical as an attack on capitalism and as political meddling.

Governments are now developing domestic climate-change plans to prepare for a United Nations summit meeting on the issue in Paris in December. The meeting’s goal is to achieve a sweeping accord in which every nation would commit to new policies to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. Many governments have yet to present plans, including major emitters like Brazil, which has a large Catholic population. The encyclical is seen as an unsubtle nudge for action.

“It gives a lot of cover to political and economic leaders in those countries, as they make decisions on climate change policy,” said Timothy Wirth, vice chairman of the United Nations Foundation.

Catholic theologians say the overarching theme of the encyclical is “integral ecology,” which links care for the environment with a notion already well developed in Catholic teaching: that economic development, to be morally good and just, must take into account people’s need for things like freedom, education and meaningful work.

“The basic idea is, in order to love God, you have to love your fellow human beings, and you have to love and care for the rest of creation,” said Vincent Miller, who holds a chair in Catholic theology and culture at the University of Dayton, a Catholic college in Ohio. “It gives Francis a very traditional basis to argue for the inclusion of environmental concern at the center of Christian faith.”

He added: “Critics will say the church can’t teach policy, the church can’t teach politics. And Francis is saying, ‘No, these things are at the core of the church’s teaching.’ ”

Francis tapped a wide variety of sources in his encyclical, partly to underscore the universality of his message. He cites passages from his two papal predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, and draws prominently from a religious ally, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He also cites a ninth-century Sufi mystic, Ali al-Khawas.

The pope begins the encyclical with a hymn by St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals and the environment. He used the Book of Genesis to underpin his theological argument. But in a passage certain to rankle some Christians, he chastises those who cite Genesis as evidence that man has “dominion” over the earth that justifies practices like mountaintop mining or fishing with gill nets.

“This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church,” Francis writes. The Bible teaches human beings to “till and keep” the garden of the world, he says. “ ‘Tilling’ refers to cultivating, plowing or working, while ‘keeping’ means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving.”

His most stinging rebuke is a broad critique of profit-seeking and the undue influence of technology on society. He praises achievements in medicine, science and engineering, but says that “our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience.”

Central to Francis’ theme is the link between poverty and the planet’s fragility. The pope rejects the belief that technology and “current economics” will solve environmental problems, or “that the problems of global hunger and poverty will be resolved simply by market growth.”

“A huge indictment I see in this encyclical is that people have lost their sense of ultimate and proper goals of technology and economics,” said Christiana Z. Peppard, an assistant professor of theology, science and ethics at Fordham University in New York. “We are focused on short-term, consumerist patterns.”

Encyclicals are letters to the clergy and laity of the church that are considered authoritative. Catholics are expected to try to sincerely embrace their teachings. But more specific assertions in them can be categorized as “prudential judgments,” a phrase that some critics have invoked to reject Francis’ positions on issues like climate change or economic inequality.

Many conservatives will be pleased with the encyclical’s strong criticism of abortion, and its dismissal of arguments that population control can be an answer to poverty. However, Francis sharply criticizes the trading of carbon credits — a market-based system central to the European Union’s climate policy — and says it “may simply become a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors.”

Above all, Francis frames the encyclical as a call to action. He praises young people for being ready for change, and said “enforceable international agreements are urgently needed.” He cites Benedict in saying that advanced societies “must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles, while reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency.”

“All is not lost,” he writes. “Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start.”",Health/Science,Environment,New York Times,06-19-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html,10-27-2015
0,Move to Fight Obama’s Climate Plan Started Early,"WASHINGTON — In the early months of 2014, a group of about 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists and Republican political strategists began meeting regularly in the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often, according to some of the participants, in a conference room overlooking the White House. Their task was to start devising a legal strategy for dismantling the climate change regulations they feared were coming from President Obama.

The group — headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, and Peter Glaser, a prominent Washington lobbyist — was getting an early start.

By the time Mr. Obama announced the regulations at the White House on Monday, the small group that had begun its work at the Chamber of Commerce had expanded into a vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican governors and congressional leaders. And their plan was to challenge Mr. Obama at every opportunity and take the fight against what, if enacted, would be one of his signature accomplishments to the Supreme Court.

Within minutes of the announcement, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, stepped before a bank of cameras for a news conference at the Greenbrier resort in his home state. Flanked by Mike Duncan, the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, one of the nation’s top coal lobbying groups, and Greg Zoeller, the attorney general of Indiana, Mr. Morrisey announced that a group of at least 15 Republican state attorneys general were preparing to jointly file a legal challenge to Mr. Obama’s proposal.

“The final rule announced Monday blatantly disregards the rule of law and will severely harm West Virginia and the U.S. economy,” Mr. Morrisey said. “This rule represents the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation’s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats and based on an obscure, rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act.”

“Our coalition, in short order, will comprise of many states, consumers, mine workers, coal operators, utilities and businesses who are united in opposition to this radical and illegal policy,” he added.

While Mr. Obama had not even put forth a draft proposal of his plans when the group started its work, the president had made plain in several speeches that he intended to act forcefully on climate change — and that he would flex the muscle of his executive authority to do so. “If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he said in his 2013 State of the Union address. The lawyers and lobbyists wanted to be ready to fire back hard and fast when he did.

In devising its strategy, the group worked closely with the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader whose coal-producing home state also stands to suffer under the regulation. While Mr. McConnell opposes the climate change regulations, his advisers knew that he had little chance of enacting legislation to block them in Congress. Instead, Mr. McConnell has taken the unusual step of reaching out directly to governors and attorneys general, urging them to refuse to submit compliance plans for the regulations, and encouraging a state-by-state rejection of the rules.

Mr. Morrisey, whose coal-producing home state is also struggling with the nation’s highest unemployment rate, was chosen as the public face of the suit. But key strategists joining the original planning were Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a former attorney general there, and Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma. Both already had experience suing the Obama administration over major Clean Air Act regulations.

An important ally in the effort was the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative advocacy group that pushes policy through state legislatures. Typically, the council’s committees of corporate members will craft a model bill designed to push through policies it supports, such as rolling back environmental regulations.

At a July meeting in San Diego, ALEC’s energy committee — which includes Mr. Duncan, the coal lobbyist who also worked closely with Mr. McConnell on his tactics — enacted a model bill designed to directly support state attorneys general who legally challenge the climate change plan. According to a person present at that July meeting, the bill would allow states to create funds, which could be funded by corporate donations, to support legal challenges to the climate change rules.

While it is not unusual for major corporations to sue the federal government over environmental regulations, people involved in the effort to craft a legal strategy against the climate change rules said the time, labor and coordination of the effort were unusual. That effort reflects the sweeping scope of climate change regulations, which, unless struck down in the Supreme Court, could transform huge sectors of the economy, potentially crippling the coal industry and other industrial sectors whose economic well-being relies on coal.

The Obama administration contends that despite the massive scale of the challenges trained against it, the climate change plan is legally sound. “The final rule is built on a rock-solid legal foundation,” said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency.

“E.P.A. is using its clear authority under the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for air pollutants,” he said. “The rule is wholly consistent with the law, and we are confident it will withstand any and all legal challenges.”

But Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has worked closely with the group, says that the attorneys general will not back down. “This rule was more aggressive than any of us could have imagined,” he said. “There is no lack of state attorneys general who would like to put a bullet in this thing.” The rules, a final, stricter version of a plan that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014, assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants. States will be allowed to create their own plans to meet the requirements and will have to submit initial versions of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.

The most aggressive of the regulations requires that by 2030, the nation’s existing power plants must cut emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels, which is an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation.

The president on Monday called the new rules a public health imperative and “the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change.” He also sought to wrap the policy in the legitimacy of transcendental values, noting that Pope Francis issued an encyclical in June, calling action on the issue a “moral obligation.”

Even as Mr. Obama acknowledged the steep resistance from coal-producing states and industry critics, he said it was up to the United States to adopt tough standards so that other countries like China would feel compelled to take similar steps.

But Mr. McConnell made it clear he would do everything in his power to combat the rules, which he said the president had crafted because he was “tired of having to work with the Congress the people elected.”

“That’s why the administration is now trying to impose these deeply regressive regulations — regulations that may be illegal, that won’t meaningfully impact the global environment, and that are likely to harm middle- and lower-class Americans most — by executive fiat,” Mr. McConnell said. “It represents a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion,” he added.",Health/Science,Environment,New York Times,08-04-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/obama-unveils-plan-to-sharply-limit-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html,10-27-2015
0,"East Coast Braces for Hurricane Joaquin, Though Path Remains Uncertain","Parts of the eastern United States, already hit by heavy rains that have caused flooding, prepared on Thursday for even more rain as Hurricane Joaquin churned through the Bahamas on a path that could unleash more stormy weather and flooding along the Atlantic Coast.

The National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory that it had upgraded the storm to an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane. It has maximum sustained winds near 130 miles per hour, with strengthening possible in the next 24 hours.

It is expected during that period to turn toward the west and north on Thursday night, passing near or over portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Friday.

While forecasters say they have yet to pin down whether the storm will hit the Eastern Seaboard, many states are bracing for its fallout. Rain and winds have been buffeting much of the East Coast this week and they are likely to continue for the next few days, even if the center of Joaquin stays offshore, the center said. Two of the more reliable tracking models keep Joaquin offshore.

That uncertainty has prompted officials in states along the Atlantic to urge residents to take precautions. Several governors have declared a state of emergency for their state.

In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory has ordered state agencies to prepare for flooding in the state, which is already saturated by another storm system that unleashed several inches of rain. The emergency management agency said five to seven inches of rain could fall Thursday through Saturday, with more on Sunday as the hurricane nears. Some forecasts say that portions of the Carolinas could get up to 20 inches of rain.

In a news conference, Mr. McCrory said nearly the entire state was under flood watch even before Hurricane Joaquin. Equipment and boats were being prepared in case evacuations were needed. Crews from central Pennsylvania were on standby in case they needed to supplement any evacuation or clearing efforts on the coast.

“We hope that we have to respond to nothing,” he said in a news conference.

Referring to the hurricane’s path, he said, “The projections are all over the place at this point and time.”

“In the next 10-24 hours we will get more direction,” he said.

He said they were most concerned about the eastern parts of the state and the coastal Outer Banks, but the storm had the potential to affect the mountain areas, because of the potential of flooding streams.

In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, allowing state and local emergency responders to begin to prepare for the eight to 10 inches of rain forecast for Thursday and Friday, as well as for any effect on the state from Hurricane Joaquin, a statement said.

The governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, who is running for the Republican nomination for president, also declared a state of emergency and canceled campaign events for the weekend ahead to focus on the storm.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York activated the state emergency operations center in Albany in anticipation of heavy rain, high winds, coastal flooding and power failures as the hurricane makes its way up the coast, a statement said.

In South Carolina, the state’s emergency management division distributed the hurricane guide online including coastal evacuation maps, information about how to stay connected, and advice on storing bottled water and nonperishable food.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the forecasts from the National Hurricane Center,” the division director, Kim Stenson, said in a statement. “We are preparing for the possibility that this storm could affect South Carolina, we’re asking residents to do the same.”

Officials in Pennsylvania urged residents to watch for flooding and strong winds. “We are several days away from any impact from Hurricane Joaquin, but we’re expecting more rain this weekend so if you live in a flood-prone area, get ready,” said Richard D. Flinn Jr., director of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.

The Delaware Emergency Management Agency said it was monitoring the potential for coastal and inland flooding over the next several days as well as the track of the hurricane.

The National Hurricane Center said the forecasts were not definitive.

“Confidence in the details of the forecast after 72 hours remains low, as there have been some large changes in the model guidance overnight,” the center said. “The range of possible outcomes is still large, and the possibility of a hurricane landfall in the Carolinas still cannot be ruled out.”

Wherever the hurricane landed, the center said, “minor to moderate coastal flooding” could be expected in the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeast throughout the weekend.

The Bahamas will bear the brunt of the storm until at least Friday, as the storm drifts southwest before turning north to pummel the country’s central islands. Storm surges of five to eight feet were expected, forecasters said, and rainfall could total as much as 20 inches.
In general, the hurricane will start to head north from the Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center said a path toward the northwest and north is expected on Friday, and a faster motion toward the north is expected Friday night and Saturday.

But some of the data models that forecasters use, gleaned from aerial surveillance missions, show several possibilities for where the hurricane goes next.

One shows the possibility of the hurricane taking a sharp westward turn over the Carolinas in three to four days. Another model suggests that the hurricane will track toward Long Island and southern New England in five days.

A further possibility is that Hurricane Joaquin will move further east into the ocean in four to five days.",Health/Science,Environment,New York Times,10-01-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/hurricane-joaquin-strengthens-as-it-spins-toward-the-bahamas.html,10-27-2015
0,"Residents Sue Seattle, Saying New Trash Rules Violate Privacy","SEATTLE — Environmental goals about garbage in this and other like-minded cities increasingly come down to three words: Throw less away. So Seattle residents are given different bins to put out on the curb — one for yard and food waste, another for recycling — and are encouraged to use ever-tinier cans for the stuff that really is trash.

The rules were given teeth this year, when Seattle became one of the first cities in the nation to penalize residents for sorting poorly. If, on inspection, more than 10 percent of a garbage can’s contents should have properly been in another kind of bin, the trash collector can pin a bright red tag on the offender’s receptacle. Financial penalties have been authorized but not yet levied. A primary goal of the policy is to keep people from throwing food and recyclable materials into trash cans.

This week, a group of Seattle residents — while stressing that they agreed with the city’s goals — said the inspections violated their privacy, as protected by the Washington State Constitution. What people toss away, the group argued in a lawsuit filed on Thursday, is still theirs to protect, however much, especially in these warm days of summer and rot, they might want to get rid of it all as soon as possible.

“This case is not about composting — this is about tossing our privacy rights in the garbage,” said Sally Oljar, 60, a graphic designer and one of the plaintiffs. “An admirable goal does not justify a bad policy,” she added.

A lawyer for the city, John Schochet, declined to comment, saying his office was still studying the lawsuit.

Other cities, including San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, have statutes requiring residents to keep food waste out of the garbage, though neither has a mechanism of enforcement like Seattle’s. And some cities, including La Crosse, Wis., have experimented with cameras that track what comes out of a bin when it is dumped.

What constitutes improper snooping in the trash is a question that courts have dug into before. The United States Supreme Court, in a case in 1988, said that the decision to throw something away effectively puts that object into the public domain. The police do not need a warrant, the court ruled, to grab a suspect’s garbage and take it down to the station for examination in a drug case.

But lawyers for the plaintiffs in Seattle said that Washington law has mostly gone the other way. The state Constitution, they said, has stringent and specific language about privacy. And the Washington Supreme Court held in a case in 1990 that law enforcement officials needed a warrant to search a suspect’s trash for evidence in a criminal case.

“A person has a legitimate expectation that the contents of his or her garbage cans will remain private,” said the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in King County Superior Court. The eight plaintiffs are represented free of charge by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, conservative group that advocates property rights and limited government.

But if residents and businesses can be driven to distraction by garbage sorting, Seattle-style, pity even more the poor garbage collector.

What, after all, is 10 percent? And how should it be calculated? A training manual for trash collection workers, posted by the plaintiffs in their lawsuit, suggests gauging the percentage by visually dividing a can into 10 segments. “Use good judgment,” the training guide says. Trash workers cannot tear into a bag to search, the manual says, but must judge only on what they can see, either through clear plastic or after the contents have been dumped into the truck.

Formal legal proof of a 10 percent violation, the lawsuit said, would require hard math: The radius squared and the height of the can would have to be multiplied by Pi (3.14, not Pie, as in a thrown-away dessert) and then divided by 10. And even before then, the plaintiffs and their lawyers said, the sorting of what goes where can be complicated.

“I try to police our garbage,” said Brian T. Hodges, a lawyer for the group, “but I have teenagers.”",Health/Science,Environment,New York Times,07-18-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/us/residents-sue-seattle-saying-new-trash-rules-violate-privacy.html,10-27-2015

0,Dangerous and invasive' Khapra beetle intercepted at Pearson,"The Pan Am Games are over, but Toronto is still attracting travellers from around the world — some with more legs than others.
U.S border agents at the airport said Tuesday they found a large quantity of Khapra beetles, considered one of the world’s most destructive stored-product pests, in a plastic bag of dried beans.
The bag had been checked in by a passenger from Somalia and was on its way to Atlanta before being intercepted by U.S authorities.
The oval Khapra beetle, about 1.6-3 mm long, is particularly dangerous because, unlike other invasive species, it feeds on healthy grains. And once the insect buries itself inside a shipment, it becomes a haven for bacteria.
In the more severe cases, infested seeds can lose up to 70 per cent of their weight.
“They are difficult to control once they are established somewhere because they will attack any kind of stored product,” said Stéphanie Boucher, an entomologist at McGill University. Wheat, barley, rice, flower, pasta and even chocolate, she said, are all seen as food by the beetle.
While eating a single Khapra beetle won’t poison you, ingesting a large quantity of them could chafe your stomach lining, Boucher said. The bugs are covered with sharp, reddish-brown hairs.
The beetle, native to India, is also incredibly hard to kill. In California, where the species was first spotted in 1953, it took 13 years and $15 million to eradicate the bug. Many types of insecticide won’t have any effect, and the beetle can hide easily by burying itself in damaged grains.
“They are a major pest causing great loss of product,” Boucher said. “They will damage the grain, they will accelerate the mold and bacteria infestation. There are many parts of the world where they are stuck with this pest.”
The Khapra beetle is currently not established in Canada. But the Canadian Food Inspection Agency warns that, if introduced, the insect could have ""severe adverse effects on our grain and oilseed industries.""
According to American border officials, the seized bag was shipped to agriculture specialists in Boston and then returned to Canada, where it was incinerated.",Health/Science,Environment,Toronto Star,08-25-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/08/25/dangerous-and-invasive-khapra-beetle-intercepted-at-pearson.html,10-27-2015
0,Canada agrees to ‘low-carbon’ strategy at G7,"SCHLOSS ELMAU, GERMANY—Canada’s energy sector will have to transform itself to lower greenhouse gas emissions in the long term, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Monday.
He was commenting at the end of the G7 leaders’ summit, which called on its members to put their energy sectors on a low-carbon footing by 2050, a move with serious implications for Canada’s greenhouse-gas-emitting oilsands.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel fell short of her goal of pushing her fellow leaders to a broad, iron-clad commitment to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Instead, the G7 agreed to a full-blown no-carbon economy, but not until 2100.
“We commit to doing our part to achieve a low-carbon global economy in the long-term, including developing and deploying innovative technologies striving for a transformation of the energy sectors by 2050 and invite all countries to join us in this endeavour,” the leaders said in their final communique.
“To this end we also commit to develop long-term, national low-carbon strategies.”
Asked what this means for Canada’s energy sector, Harper said:
“Nobody’s going to start to shut down their industries or turn off the lights. We simply got to find a way to create lower-carbon emitting sources of energy.”
Harper took part the G7 leaders’ shortened talks on climate change as the summit entered its second and final day.
“All leaders understand that to achieve these kinds of milestones over the decades to come will require serious technological transformation,” Harper said.
The Canadian Press has been told by sources who saw the working draft of the G7’s climate-change communique that Canada and Japan worked behind the scenes to water down the statement.
Merkel placed the fight against climate change at the heart of her sweeping agenda.
She wanted the G7 summit to give France momentum when it hosts the United Nations climate change conference this December, which aims to reach a breakthrough agreement in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Merkel had been pushing the G7 to endorse a pledge to reach zero carbon emissions, but Canada and Japan were holdouts.
“Canada and Japan are the most concerned about this one,” said one source who was privy to discussions but would only speak on the condition of anonymity.
“The two of those countries have been the most difficult on every issue on climate. They don’t want any types of targets in there, so I think they are trying to make it as vague as possible at this point.”
Harper and Merkel spoke together on Sunday, but the prime minister’s office said they did not discuss climate change.
“It’s shocking that Mr. Harper didn’t even bother to bring up climate change as an issue for discussion during his bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel,” said New Democrat foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar.
He said Harper is out of touch and sidelining Canada internationally.
Harper’s office said in a statement that the French-led climate talks focused on the “collective response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the advancement of energy security in the face of escalating threats.”
It said the G7 leaders chose to devote a portion of the climate session to a discussion of global security threats posed by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria and the ongoing fight against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. Harper’s only bilateral meeting on Monday was with newly elected Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.
A senior Canadian government official, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said Canada endorses a statement by the G7 that would support the December climate change talks in France.
“We support agreement in Paris that includes all GHG emitting countries,” the official said, noting that in 2013 Canada’s emissions dropped 3.1 per cent from 2005 levels.
“We believe we have a fair and ambitious reduction target that is in line with other major industrialized economies. It reflects our national circumstance,” the Canadian official said.
Other groups disagree.
“It’s pretty clear that Canada and Japan are in a different place than the rest of the G7 on the issue of climate change,” said Jennifer Morgan, director of the global climate program at the Washington, D.C.-based World Resources Institute.",Health/Science,Environment,Toronto Star,06-08-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/06/08/canada-japan-said-blocking-g7-push-on-climate-change.html,10-27-2015
0,"CSIS warns of ‘extremist’ opposition to oil and gas sector
","OTTAWA—Canada’s spies are warning the federal government about an “extremist” threat to natural resource development, internal documents show.
“Extremists” have united both in person and online in their opposition to Canadian natural resource projects, according to a September 2014 “threat overview” prepared by CSIS for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney.
The heavily censored document does not outline specific threats or projects, nor does it single out particular groups. But it lists the threat between sections on terrorist travellers and a growing anti-Muslim movement advocating violence in Canada.
The CSIS report, obtained under Access to Information law, mirrors strong language in a January 2014 report from the RCMP warning of an “anti-Canadian petroleum movement.” The report, obtained by Greenpeace, said that movement is well financed and organized, and includes “peaceful activists, militants, and violent extremists.”
The RCMP specifically referred to 2013 shale gas protests in New Brunswick, where protesters from the Elsipogtog First Nation clashed with police.
Canada’s spies and police have monitored all manner of protests — including environmental activism — even if those demonstrations remained peaceful.
The Conservative government has defended the practice of monitoring that dissent, saying even peaceful protests can turn ugly and public safety must be maintained in the event of violence.
Activists have expressed concerns that expanded powers for CSIS, contained within the government’s anti-terror legislation, Bill C-51, will mean increased monitoring and “disruption” of environmental and First Nations protests.
Craig Forcese, who specializes in national security law and has been a vocal critic of Bill C-51, says violent protests may fall under CSIS’s purview. The question for Forcese, however, is how many people fall under CSIS’s definition of extremist.
“It’s not improper, it seems to me, to be concerned about someone who might be preparing a pipe bomb, or might be involved in the sabotage of a pipeline,” Forcese said in an interview Thursday.
“The question is how broad the brush stroke is, and that’s really difficult to answer.”
The Star requested an interview with Blaney’s office, and included specific questions about how the government defines “extremist” activity and what natural resource projects have been threatened by extremists.
“The safety and security of Canadians is of the utmost importance to our government, and we take any threat to the security of Canadians and their livelihood seriously,” said Blaney’s spokesperson, Jeremy Laurin, in a written statement.
“Our police officers have a mandate and responsibility to investigate threats as they arise.
“Our government respects and protects the right of Canadians to participate in lawful protest activities.""
NDP environment critic Megan Leslie said there are valid reasons to monitor people suspected of plotting attacks or violence. But Leslie worries that the “extremist” label could be applied too broadly.
“Because of the way (the government is) so carelessly using language, or purposefully using language to be very broad and apply to everyone, that’s where the danger lays,” Leslie said Wednesday.
“Either they’re tossing around words like ‘extremist’ willy-nilly, which is pretty terrible, or they’re doing it intentionally, which is just as terrible. People are going to get scooped up in this who are not threats to national security.”",Health/Science,Environment,Toronto Star,05-14-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/05/14/csis-warns-of-extremist-opposition-to-oil-and-gas-sector.html,10-27-2015

Even before he departed, Obama was making waves with a decision to rename Alaska’s famed Mount McKinley despite a backlash.
The gesture was a major show of solidarity with the Alaska Arctic’s native people, who have received less attention amid Obama’s recent efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans in the mainland U.S.
Obama announced that his administration is changing the name of North America’s tallest peak, the 6,193-metre Mount McKinley, to Denali, its traditional Athabascan name.
Obama’s move to strip the mountain of its name honouring former President William McKinley, who was assassinated, drew loud condemnations from lawmakers in his native state of Ohio.
Yet Obama was to navigate far more turbulent political waters in Anchorage, where his grand declarations on climate change have been met with skepticism by leaders in a state that’s heavily dependent on oil revenues, which have fallen precipitously.
At the same time, environmental groups warned that Obama hadn’t done enough to protect Alaska and the climate. They took particular offence at his administration’s move just a few weeks ago to give Royal Dutch Shell a final permit for expanded drilling off Alaska’s northwest coast.
“I share people’s concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well,” Obama said in his weekly address. Yet he said the U.S. economy still had to rely on oil and gas while it transitions to cleaner renewable fuels, and said his administration was ensuring those risks were minimized.
Obama was to hold a listening session with Alaska Natives before speaking at a climate-focused Arctic summit, which involves leaders from Arctic and non-Arctic nations.
Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are intensely focused on a global climate treaty that nations hope to finalize in December, as the president works to secure his environmental legacy before leaving office.
Obama has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 per cent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and planned to use the Alaska visit to press other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.
Kerry told reporters in Alaska on Sunday that climate change skeptics won’t be remembered kindly.
“I think the people who are slow to come to this table will be written up by historians as having been some of the folks most irresponsible in understanding and reacting to scientific analysis,” Kerry said.
Obama will also go on a boat tour Tuesday of Kenai Fjords National Park and to hike to Exit Glacier, a sprawling expanse of ice that is retreating, in what environmentalists say is a dramatic sign of warming temperatures.
In Dillingham, in southwest Alaska, Obama will meet Wednesday with fishermen locked in an conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world’s largest salmon fishery. Then he’ll fly north to Kotzebue in the Alaska Arctic to focus on the plight of rural, Native villages where livelihoods are threatened by climate change.",Health/Science,Environment,Toronto Star,08-31-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/08/31/obama-heads-into-turbulence-on-3-day-alaska-trip.html,10-27-2015
0,"Chris Christie Still Likes Donald Trump, Despite Comments on Immigrants","At a time when many Republicans are racing to distance themselves from Donald J. Trump, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is forging an unusual path: He’s taking pains to emphasize that, although he found Mr. Trump’s comments on illegal immigrants “inappropriate,” the real estate baron is a “friend,” the two are “close” and Mr. Trump is “a good guy.”

The tactic — a hate-the-sin, love-the-sinner approach to politics — is striking because Mr. Christie has long prided himself on the depth of his support from Latinos, who reacted with anger and dismay to Mr. Trump’s assertion that Mexicans sneaking across the border are rapists and criminals.

To be sure, Mr. Christie denounced Mr. Trump’s caustic words on immigrants on Mr. Christie’s second day as an official candidate for president, saying at a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., that “the comments were inappropriate and have no place in this race.”

But as for the man himself? Here’s a few of the nicer things Mr. Christie has had to say about Mr. Trump:

On July 1: Mr. Christie told Sean Hannity of Fox News that the first thing that came to mind when he heard Mr. Trump’s name was “a friend.”

On July 3: “I like Donald. He’s a good guy.”

On July 6: “He tries to provoke reaction, that’s part of who Donald is.” Mr. Christie also added that Mr. Trump is a “good friend.”

And Monday morning, on “Fox and Friends,” Mr. Christie said he had had enough with the Trump questions. “Donald is a friend, I’ve known him for 13 years, and I like him personally.”

He added: “But his comments were inappropriate. That’s now the 50th time I’ve said it. It’s going to be the last time I say it.”

The two have indeed been friends for a while. But Mr. Christie’s frequent pledges of friendship could be a curious and potentially treacherous path.

The governor has made outreach to the Latino community a centerpiece of both his record and his campaign: He won over 50 percent of the Latino vote in his re-election, a fact he regularly points out on the campaign trail, and he took a three-day trip to Mexico in September.

And the proposals that he has outlined on immigration and boarder security – that a fence along the southern border is ineffective and sends the wrong message – run in direct contrast to Mr. Trump’s promise to build as grand and imposing a border fence as humanly possible.

But perhaps those disagreements are best worked out among friends.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,New York Times,07-13-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/13/chris-christie-still-likes-donald-trump-despite-comments-on-immigrants/,11-15-2015
0,"Despite Good Intentions, Vacancies in Refugee Camp in Jordan for Syrians","AL AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — Here in Jordan’s vast northeastern desert, row after row of white steel shelters built specially for Syrian refugees sit empty.

Storefronts lining a street designed to mimic an urban souk are shuttered, the silence broken only by the punishing wind that is infamous here. Layers of sand coat the windows and floors.

Syrian families live in other parts of the camp, one of the only places left in Jordan where most new refugees are allowed to settle. But nearly 11 months after the camp opened, there are many areas that are deserted.

It was not supposed to be this way.

Built with tens of millions of dollars of international donor money, Azraq was meant to solve myriad problems for both Jordan and the Syrians who have flooded over the border since civil war began to tear apart their country in 2011.
For Jordan, the camp was expected to relieve the burden that hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians are placing on the country’s fragile economy and crowded cities. For the refugees, Azraq was expected to be something of a step up despite its remoteness, a better-planned camp designed around “villages” where people from the same Syrian towns and cities could cluster near shared schools and playgrounds.

Despite the good intentions, only about 14,500 refugees have settled here, although at least 60,000 had been expected to live at the camp by the end of last year.

The shortfall in the number is symbolic of a wider breakdown in the international system to save Syrians from a war that is entering its fifth year, with more neighboring countries making it harder for Syrians to flee across their borders and Western countries cutting back on aid and still mainly unwilling to resettle large numbers of the refugees.

“If we had the rate of arrivals that we had in 2012, Azraq today would have 200,000 people,” said Davide Terzi, Jordan’s chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration, the agency responsible for the transfer of refugees from the border area to refugee camps.

The main reason that Azraq is so empty, at least so far, appears to be fear. The camp opened last April, after Islamic State militants seized significant territory in Syria and became a dangerous new factor in the war, raising anxiety that its fighters would cross into Jordan along with refugees. After years when hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Syrians were allowed into Jordan each week, the kingdom has slowed that flood to a relative trickle.

Another reason for the slowdown, the United Nations refugee agency says, is Jordan’s worry that donor fatigue will leave it to care for a refugee population that is beginning to feel permanent, or at least long-term.

That fear rose in December, after a drop in donor funding led the World Food Program to briefly warn that it would have to cut off food aid for the hundreds of thousands living outside the camps.

But Azraq’s desolation has also complicated efforts to fill the camp. Of the more than 35,000 refugees brought to the camp, around 19,000 have left, starving the camp of the thriving street life that was supposed to entice people to stay, according to data provided by the government and aid agencies.

“When I first arrived and saw the camp, I almost had a heart attack,” said Ahmad Abed Rabo, 79, who arrived with his family last July. “The sense of emptiness and uncertainty overwhelmed me.”

More troubling for Jordan, aid agencies say the vast majority of those who left the camp settled illegally in the very cities and towns the camp was built to relieve. (At least 625,000 Syrians have settled in Jordan since the war started, and only about 100,000 are in camps, according to the United Nations refugee agency.)

At least in public, donors who poured money into the camp are not pushing Jordan — an active ally in the military fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL — to change its policies. Money spent on Azraq, they say, is part of a broader policy of supporting Jordan as it struggles to maintain its security in a turbulent region.

“There are hard choices to be made by the Jordanian government, and we understand,” Mr. Terzi said in an interview. “National security is paramount.”

When Azraq opened, it was one of four camps housing displaced Syrians. The largest camp, Zaatari, opened in 2012 and was initially known for its crime and chaos. Azraq was, in some ways, envisioned as the anti-Zaatari, a better-designed camp meant to build a cohesive community.

To avoid Zaatari’s cramped quarters, Azraq is four times the size and was designed with precision, rather than piecemeal as Zaatari was at a time when Jordan was scrambling to house the early flood of refugees.

Azraq’s designers have succeeded in some ways. Security has never been a big issue here, as it was at Zaatari, in part because of more policing.

Azraq also has a well-equipped hospital and a well-stocked supermarket, where refugees can spend food coupons provided by the World Food Program to buy hunks of cheese, olive oil, rice and nuts, reminders of home. And rather than the tents used at Zaatari, small shelters designed to better withstand heat and wind house Azraq’s residents.

Still, life in the camp is routinely harsh. There is electricity provided by generators only in very limited areas. Refugees, many of them former city dwellers, worry about the scorpions, and about snakes they fear will be attracted by the mice that have already overrun the camp.

But perhaps the biggest complaint is the lack of bustle that would naturally accompany a larger population.

“Azraq still needs to get that sense of community,” said Andrew Harper, the top official with the United Nations refugee agency in Jordan.

In addition to the more than 80,000 Syrians at Zaatari, a bustling street market created and run by the refugees has contributed to what aid officials and refugees call a sense of “dignity.”

“The market is where people meet and drink tea,” said Jina Krause-Vilmar, director at the Near East Foundation, a nonprofit organization helping vulnerable communities. “It’s where a sense of community is established.”

The street market at Azraq would go a long way toward relieving the bleakness, but it remains unopened, according to the United Nations and the spokesman for the Jordanian government, Mohammad Momani, because the government wants to impose taxes and possibly other fees on those who set up businesses. (Mr. Momani said he expected the market to open soon.)

A man who would identify himself only as Abu Eiad, 51, is one of those who left the camp, in his case for a northern Jordanian town. He arrived last June from Damascus after a grueling journey with two of his remaining three children. A son who joined the Free Syrian Army, an armed group fighting the Syrian government, had already been killed, and his wife died during fierce clashes on a visit to her family’s hometown, Dara’a.

But after living in the camp for one month, he could not take the rough conditions. He said he left legally through a temporary travel permit, but never returned.

“My health was deteriorating,” he said. “I couldn’t take my kids out of the shelter at night because I was afraid they would be bitten by hyenas or vicious animals in the desert.”

Aid workers said the tide might be turning somewhat at Azraq, with a small number of refugees recently leaving cities and towns for the camp, but only because they are desperate. Living outside the camp, they receive considerably less international help than they do inside, where they are entitled to free health care and larger food rations.

Abu Eiad said he would not be moving to the camp.

“It’s true that I am living in poverty here and my son is not attending school,” he said, referring to the town where he has been living, “but if I was forced to leave this place, I would return to Syria, not to the camp.”",Politics/Civics,Immigration,New York Times,03-16-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/world/middleeast/despite-good-intentions-vacancies-in-refugee-camp-for-syrians.html,11-15-2015
0,Walker Denies Remarks Indicating Change in Immigration Stance,"Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a possible candidate for president in 2016, told a private gathering of New Hampshire Republicans this month that he supported a pathway to legal status — but not citizenship — for undocumented immigrants in the United States, according to the chairwoman of the state’s Republican Party.

The chairwoman, Jennifer Horn, described Mr. Walker’s statements on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported that Mr. Walker had endorsed eventual citizenship for those immigrants, which many Republicans oppose.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Walker, Kirsten Kukowski, disputed those reports about Mr. Walker embracing a pathway to citizenship.

“Governor Walker has been very clear that he does not support amnesty and believes that border security must be established and the rule of law must be followed,” she said in a statement. “He does not support citizenship for illegal immigrants.” She did not respond to requests to provide any audio recording of Mr. Walker’s remarks at the Copper Door.

Mr. Walker tends to avoid phrases like “legal status” and “citizenship” in public, but has said emphatically that he opposes any amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Mr. Walker did once support a pathway to citizenship, but said he changed his mind after talking to governors of border states, among others. Any perceived reversal on the immigration issue would complicate Mr. Walker’s efforts to appeal to many conservative Republican primary voters and leave him open to criticism for changing positions.

Mr. Walker’s remarks came during a gathering with Republican activists after a dinner at the Copper Door restaurant in Bedford, N.H., where he ate with Ms. Horn and a few other guests.

After the dinner, a few Republican activists joined Mr. Walker for coffee and cake, and to ask him questions. One of the questions, according to Ms. Horn, was about Mr. Walker’s position on immigration.

Mr. Walker spoke for roughly three minutes about a process in which undocumented immigrants would be required to start the process anew and pay back taxes.

But Mr. Walker’s answer was apparently vague enough to prompt Ms. Horn to follow-up.

“To clarify, what you are saying is that you are advocating that the people who are already here, the 11-12 million people who are here illegally in our country, should have a path to legal status, not citizenship?” she asked.

“Yes,” Mr. Walker responded, according to Ms. Horn.

Another New Hampshire Republican who was there, Mark Vincent, chairman of the Hillsborough County Republican Committee, said he did not remember Mr. Walker ever using the word “citizenship” in his remarks.

“I remember him saying he supported a path to legal status,” said Mr. Vincent, who plans to remain neutral in the state’s 2016 Republican presidential primary.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,New York Times,03-26-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/26/walker-denies-remarks-indicating-change-in-immigration-stance/,11-15-2015
0,New York City From a Pint-Size Perspective,"Until my 8-year-old granddaughter, Emilia, and I pretended to be tourists in New York, it had honestly never occurred to me that Times Square might be the nicest neighborhood in the city. At the places where out-of-towners go, I was struck by how many young employees of these attractions asked us if we were enjoying ourselves, if we were having fun. More surprisingly, they seemed genuinely interested in our replies. They appeared to have been hired for their humorous, friendly dispositions.

I’ve lived in New York almost all my life, but not once have so many strangers inquired after my welfare and happiness as they did during the snowy February weekend and the subsequent Sunday in early March during which Emilia and I played tourist.

The project was Emilia’s idea. She’s at an age at which she has a spongelike relationship with information, and some of that new information concerns the city where she has lived all her life. She’d been saying she wanted to go to Times Square, where in fact she’s been — we’d seen “Matilda” and “The Lion King” on Broadway — but she didn’t know that. Maybe she was confused because Times Square was never presented to her as a destination, but rather as an obstacle course to be traversed between the subway and the theater.

She also asked to go to the top of the Empire State Building, where I had never been, and to visit the Statue of Liberty, where I hadn’t been since a day-camp field trip, during the summer after fifth grade. And though she’s been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we agreed we’d go there so she could help her grandmother tell other children (and their families) what they might like to see.

In fact, by the time we finished our pretend tour of New York, I wanted to urge all my out-of-town friends with children and grandchildren: Come visit! Bring the family! Whatever you’ve heard about the city being crowded or dirty or unfriendly isn’t true. It’s a playground for young and old!

Emilia and I started at the Empire State Building. The observatory entrance, on Fifth Avenue just south of 34th Street, is decorated with traces of Art Deco, a foretaste of the gleaming Art Deco sculptures and paneling employed throughout the building’s magnificent lobby. I’d been warned by friends to go early in the day. I’d also been advised to purchase tickets to the observatories (on the 86th and 102nd floor) online, in advance, so as to avoid the long lines and lengthy waits for the elevators.

At 10 in the morning in the dead of winter, the lines weren’t especially long, and we could probably have done without the (expensive) advance tickets, but the pile-up at the security checkpoint and the roped-off mazes prepared to keep crowds inching along made us realize that on another day, at another time, our experience could have been very different. The elevator rides were fast and fun, and I loved the view from the open observatory on the 86th floor and the smaller, enclosed one, higher up.

It was especially pleasant to take in the amazing 360-degree panorama without the crowds, which, I imagine, could make the observation deck feel like a rush-hour subway, 86 stories high. Emilia found the experience exciting, but less fun. She’s not an anxious or fearful child, but she is an honest one. She admitted that the view — we could see all the way into Brooklyn and pick out the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, near where she lives — was awesome. But there was something slightly sickening about looking down from that height. Once around each of the observatories and she was ready to go back down, though she smiled politely at the elevator operators and guards who asked if we had had a good time.

Another thing we did in advance, and which I tell everyone with children living in New York or planning a trip here to do ahead, is buy tickets for a play at the New Victory Theater. On 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the New Victory is a vintage theater refurbished just enough to retain plenty of funky charm. It specializes in children’s programming, featuring theater groups from all over the world. The shows we’ve liked best in the past have been the most circuslike.

This time we watched a performance titled “Cambuyon,” featuring a troupe (from Barcelona and the Canary Islands) of tap and hip-hop dancers, vocalists and percussionists, a riveting succession of numbers including a singer who could imitate all the instruments in a band and a pair or dancers — sisters, or Emilia thought, maybe twins — who could give the impression of dislocating and reattaching every joint in their bodies. The theater is staffed by city teenagers who couldn’t be nicer; tickets are reasonably priced, refreshments cheap, and no one hawks costly corporate souvenirs during intermission.

If we hadn’t had theater tickets for noon, we could have spent much longer at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, which was not only far more enjoyable than I’d imagined but potentially educational: I would have liked to have had the time and leisure to tell Emilia more about some of the figures we encountered: Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro and the Dalai Lama, among many others. But perhaps it was better that I simply followed her around as she ran to see the exhibits that most interested her: Taylor Swift, Abraham Lincoln and Amelia Earhart, whom she had learned all about in school.

After she overcame the initial creepiness (her word) of seeing people made of wax, she was in a state of pure delight. She asked to have her picture taken with “Judy Garland” as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” and would have climbed onto E.T.’s bicycle if there hadn’t been a line.

Flatteringly, she’d asked if there would be a statue of me. I said I imagined very few writers would be there, but in fact we saw likenesses of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Maya Angelou. It was interesting to see whom she recognized (Albert Einstein, Jimi Hendrix) and whom she didn’t (the Spice Girls and the Jonas Brothers are ancient history for an 8-year-old).

But it was no surprise that her absolute favorite moment of our entire pretend-tourist excursion was the chance to have her picture taken with statues of the Beatles. She’s going through an intense Beatlemania phase, and it thrilled her to sit at the feet of her idols. In the elevator going down, a young museum employee asked what Emilia had liked best, and they had a lively conversation about the Beatles.

As a responsible grandparent, I can usually hold out against requests for revolting quantities of sugar, but I’d be lying if I said we didn’t enjoy the Times Square M & M’s store, at Broadway and 49th Street, on the northern fringes of Times Square. The columns of colored candies (25,000 square feet of candy!) with levers that release precise helpings of sweetness into plastic bags had an amusing Willy Wonka fantasy element, and we promised each other (and, in absentia, Emilia’s mom and dad) that we would never again consume three-quarters of a pound of candy over a single weekend.

Saving the sweets for dessert, we walked around the neighborhood until we found a place where we felt like having lunch. Emilia’s out-of-towner facade cracked to reveal the cosmopolitan Brooklynite when she asked if we could eat at the Thai restaurant, Pongsri, on 48th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, where she ordered (and ate all of) a delicious pad thai.

As we traveled uptown to meet her grandpa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Emilia, who’s been there often, said that she would be our guide to what she considered the most child-friendly exhibits.

I was glad to see that the Egyptian tombs and the hall of the medieval knights in armor were as thrilling to her as they’d been to me, when I was her age. She’s especially fond of the galleries off the equestrian armor hall, which feature the imposing and terrifying masks, helmets and body armor favored by Japanese samurais.

Other big hits were the Temple of Dendur, where the large open areas, the windows looking out onto Central Park and the reflecting pool provide a welcome break from the more confining spaces of the traditional galleries.

Emilia, who is half Mexican, feels a kind of national pride in the collection of brilliantly decorative gold jewelry made by the ancient civilizations that inhabited Central America. And the Michael C. Rockefeller wing — with gigantic figures, as large as small buildings and fashioned by the Asmat, an ethnic group in New Guinea — is a perennial favorite.

As a general rule for museum-going with children, I prefer to see a couple of exhibits and then get out before exhaustion and boredom set in. But during this somewhat longer visit, Emilia handled the problem of visual-art overload (which even adults experience) by taking pictures with my phone (permitted, as long as there is no flash) of everything that caught her eye. At first I mistook this for a way of not really looking, but after a while I realized that it was her way of looking without having to worry about remembering what she’d seen.

The public cafeteria in the basement of the museum was a major success, with excellent food and a wide array of choices. Apparently having learned from the fast-food industry’s creative approach to packaging, the museum allows kids to choose their food and arrange it in cardboard containers designed to look like yellow New York taxi cabs.

Emilia was excited about our trip to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. She prepared by reading a children’s book, “You Wouldn’t Want to Be a Worker on the Statue of Liberty,” part of a witty and informative series, each emphasizing the hardship of building various world monuments (the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids). She had learned many interesting facts: Did I know that the statue used to be the color of a new penny?
Even on a cold and windy Sunday morning in March, the ferries to Lady Liberty and from there to Ellis Island and home were mobbed with tourists, the majority of whom seemed to have come from Europe and Asia. The ferry rides were brief and pleasant, in fact so brief I spent a good part of the trip from Battery Park to Liberty Island waiting in line for a soda at the snack bar.

To reach the statue’s pedestal required us to pass through tight security twice, once before boarding the boat and once at the entrance to the statue. And by the time we finished waiting on windy docks, shuffling slowly forward in crowds and being instructed to remove our watches and sweaters, I felt I was not only visiting the scene of my great-grandparents’ arrival at Ellis Island, but partly reliving it, minus the anti-lice fumigation and the mandatory dental exam.

In advance of our trip to the statue, we bought “platform access” tickets, which required a somewhat arduous climb up flights of stairs (the elevator seemed not to be working) at the end of which we were able to step out on a rather narrow platform from which we could see more of the New York skyline and the harbor, and less of the statue than we had from the ground. Happily, tickets to Lady Liberty’s crown, which involves a very long climb, were not available until the beginning of June.

Tickets to the Statue of Liberty allow passengers to take three ferry trips: from downtown Manhattan to Liberty Island, from there to Ellis Island, and back to Manhattan, though it’s possible to skip the Ellis Island portion and remain on the boat. On the day of our excursion, the ferry rides and the waits in line to board the boats were approximately the same length.

The Ellis Island Museum is housed in a historic and fascinatingly evocative structure; the restoration has preserved many of the original tiles and architectural details. And in the enormous, high-ceilinged registry room, we got the sense of what it might have been like to wait for one’s name to be called by immigration officials. But the museum exhibits (mostly large placards and captions) seemed old-fashioned and a little tired, and while a tech-savvy 8-year-old was able to figure out how the guided audio tour worked, her grandmother was not.

Our experience as pretend tourists occupied the better part of two days. We could have done it in a weekend if bad weather hadn’t forced us to wait two weeks between our trips to Times Square and the Statue of Liberty. The best part of the second day, we both agreed, was the ferry ride to Liberty Island.

As the statue comes slowly into view it’s impossible not to be struck by how beautiful, how powerfully meaningful, it is; and I found it moving to approach Ellis Island by boat and to know that my ancestors had made a similar journey during the first decade of the 20th century.

By the end of the day (a day during which I decided that if I were ever to do it again, let’s say when my 6-month-old grandson wants to play tourist, I’d go early on a weekday morning) I felt much as I imagine my great-grandmother must have felt at the end of her voyage: grateful and relieved. And it crossed my mind that no one had asked us if we were having a good time — even though we’d had such a good time pretending to be tourists in the exciting and surprisingly friendly city in which we live.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,New York Times,05-01-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/travel/new-york-city-from-a-pint-size-perspective.html,11-15-2015
0,Eastern Bloc’s Resistance to Refugees Highlights Europe’s Cultural and Political Divisions,"WARSAW — Even though the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been asked to accept just a tiny fraction of the refugees that Germany and other nations are taking, their fierce resistance now stands as the main impediment to a unified European response to the crisis.

Poland’s new president, Andrzej Duda, has complained about “dictates” from the European Union to accept migrants flowing onto the Continent from the Middle East and Africa.

Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, says his country will accept only Christian refugees as it would be “false solidarity” to force Muslims to settle in a country without a single mosque. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s hard-line prime minister, calls the influx a “rebellion by illegal migrants” and pledges a new crackdown this week.

The discord has further unsettled a union already shaky from struggles over the euro and the Greek financial crisis and now facing a historic influx of people attracted by Europe’s relative peace and prosperity.

When representatives of the European Union nations meet on Monday to take up a proposal for allocating refugees among them, Central and Eastern European nations are likely to be the most vocal opponents. Their stance — reflecting a mix of powerful far-right movements, nationalism, racial and religious prejudices as well as economic arguments that they are less able to afford to take in outsiders than their wealthier neighbors — is the latest evidence of the stubborn cultural and political divides that persist between East and West.

When joining the European Union — as the former Communist countries have done since 2004 — nations are asked to pledge support to a raft of so-called European values, including open markets, transparent government, respect for an independent media, open borders, cultural diversity, protection of minorities and a rejection of xenophobia.

But the reality is that the former Communist states have proved sluggish in actually absorbing many of these values and practicing them. Oligarchs, cronyism and endemic corruption remain a part of daily life in many of the countries, freedom of the press is in decline while rising nationalism and populist political movements have stirred anti-immigrant tensions.

“People must remember that Poland has been transitioning from communism for only 25 years,” Lech Walesa, who led that country’s independence movement, said in an interview. “Our salaries and houses are still smaller than those in the West. Many people here don’t believe that they have anything to share with migrants. Especially that they see that migrants are often well-dressed, sometimes better than many Poles.”

Few migrants, in fact, are particularly interested in settling in Eastern Europe, preferring to head to Germany or Scandinavia, where social welfare benefits are higher, employment opportunities greater and immigrant communities better established. In that sense, migrants are aligned with leaders in Eastern and Central European capitals, who frequently argue that the 28-member bloc should focus first on securing its borders and figuring out a way to end the war in Syria before talking about mandatory quotas for accepting refugees.

But as often as not, the political discourse in these countries has quickly moved toward a wariness of accepting racial and religious diversity.

“This refugee flow has outraged the right wing,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “If you scratch the surface, why are they so upset? It’s not about jobs or the ability to manage them or social welfare. What it is really about is that they are Muslim.”

Unlike countries in Western Europe, which have long histories of accepting immigrants from diverse cultures, the former Communist states tend to be highly homogeneous. Poland, for instance, is 98 percent white and 94 percent Catholic.

“And the countries that have very little diversity are some of the most virulently against refugees,” said Andrew Stroehlein, European media director for Human Rights Watch.

Even mainstream political leaders eager for closer ties to Brussels, the European Union’s headquarters, feel pressure to appeal to this growing nationalist wave.

“By toughening up their rhetoric and showing a strong hand toward the Roma minority, facing down the E.U. and refusing a common solution to the refugee crisis, they are trying to outbid the far right and keep the traditional political parties in power,” said Zuzana Kusá, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

There is also widespread disappointment with the pace of economic change since communism’s fall, and a sense that the countries are too poor to offer substantial support to immigrants.

“There is a long history of victimization in our region,” said Csaba Szaló, a professor of sociology at Masaryk University in Brno. “We are the ones who have always been victims of injustice, the ones who have suffered. And now there is somebody trying to grab that status. People find it very difficult to accept that somebody might suffer more than us.”

While rising xenophobia is playing a role, there are other factors behind the East-West divide, said Marcin Zaborowski, executive vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis and head of its Warsaw office.

“The primary reason for this difference in attitude is that we come from a region where the tradition of accepting culturally different refugees is very weak,” he said. “And now there is this wave of refugees from another continent that has no precedent, so people don’t know what to think.”

Most of the countries, like Poland, have “no proper infrastructure in place to deal with such cultural assimilation” and little appetite to spend precious resources building one, Mr. Zaborowski said.

As for the region’s seeming indifference to the migrants’ plight, that is partly because unlike France, Britain and Germany, the former Communist states have no history of colonialism, he said.

“The attitude is: We didn’t meddle in these countries that are now sending the refugees, like other nations did, and so we have no sense of guilt about our obligation to deal with them,” Mr. Zaborowski said.

And all of these attitudes blend together into a common aversion to being told what to do by Brussels.

In Hungary, Mr. Orban has taken a particularly uncompromising approach, demanding more help from Brussels in dealing with the tens of thousands who continue to enter his country while insisting that Hungary is under no obligation to endanger its traditional Christian values by accepting large numbers of Muslims.

On Tuesday, a new raft of refugee laws go into effect that will allow the Hungarian government to build new “transit zones” at the border where arrivals would have their asylum requests quickly reviewed — eight days, plus three more for an appeal, a pace that refugee advocates believe violates European Union due process rules.

But Hungary is not the only country that has taken a hard line or seen anti-immigrant protests.

Anti-immigrant marches have become a regular occurrence in Slovakia and some other nations.

In Estonia, the northernmost Baltic nation, which has a population of just 1.3 million, an agreement to accept fewer than 200 refugees over the next two years was enough to set off protests. Right-wing bikers demonstrated outside the country’s only refugee relocation facility in July, and earlier this month it was severely damaged in a fire.

Officials in Latvia said they would continue to resist mandatory requirements that they accept a set number of refugees while the parties in the ruling coalition appear unable to agree on whether to require a parliamentary vote on the issue.

“It would be very wrong and sad if this matter threatened the government,” said President Raimonds Vejonis.

Lithuanian officials said they were open to discussing the acceptance of more refugees, but only on a voluntary basis, and would continue to oppose a “permanent mechanism” that would allocate future refugees.

Bulgaria had agreed to accept 500 refugees, but under a new formula unveiled last week, it could be asked to take up to 2,000.

Talking by phone while driving from an economic conference in southern Poland, Robert Biedron, the mayor of the city of Slupsk, said he was ashamed of the reaction of many to the plight of the migrants. “There is always conflict around the world and people need help,” Mr. Biedron said. “Perhaps, someday again, the Polish people might need help. Do we want to hear, ‘Oh, Poles are a danger to society, you are different, you are not of our culture.’ ”

Already, he said, he has blocked many former friends on Facebook — “even well-educated people, who I thought were my friends” — over anti-immigrant comments they have posted.

“Here I am, driving on a road that was built with European Union money,” Mr. Biedron said. “It was built with money taken from taxpayers in Italy and Germany and France. Now we refuse to do our part? I am really ashamed.”

Mr. Walesa said he intended to do his part. Reacting to a call from Pope Francis that Catholics take in a refugee family, Mr. Walesa said he wanted to do just that, if he can talk his wife into it.

“She is reluctant,” he said. “She had to single-handedly raise our children and she’s exhausted. So I would have to be the one responsible for taking care of the migrants.”",Politics/Civics,Immigration,New York Times,09-12-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/europe/eastern-europe-migrant-refugee-crisis.html,11-15-2015
0,Temporary foreign workers help drive Fort McMurray’s 24-7 economy,"FORT MCMURRAY, ALTA.—Work in the oilsands never stops: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Christmas, New Year’s and long weekends.
Little surprise that the residents of Fort McMurray work the longest hours in Canada and earn the highest average annual household income: $191,507.
Because it’s a 24-7 economy, it’s not unusual to see pickup trucks lined up at the Tim Hortons drive-thru at 5 in the morning and continuing for the rest of the day. Earlier this year, the long lines were creating traffic hazards so the RCMP handed out $172 tickets to vehicles blocking adjacent roads.
Those Tim Hortons, McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s and A&W outlets are an essential part of life in hectic “Fort Mac” and, for the most part, they depend on temporary foreign workers, who earn between $15 and $18 an hour.
May, 36, who has been in Canada for three years, says she was recruited from the Philippines to work at a fast food counter.
“But I didn’t like it, so I switched and became a nanny.”
With the long work hours, and the number of households where both parents work in the oilpatch, there is a high demand for domestic help.
Earlier this year, Sara Dorow, a sociologist at the University of Alberta, completed a study of nannies working in Fort McMurray.
She estimates there are 600 to 1,000 nannies. Parents with two preschool-aged children save an average of $6,970 a year by hiring one. And the savings are greater with more children. Licensed daycare, if you can find it, costs between $1,300 and $2,000 a month for each space, she told the Edmonton Journal.
Wages for a nanny can run anywhere between $12 and $20 an hour.
Eighty per cent of families with nannies have at least one spouse working at an oilsands plant. “In other words, the oilsands industry is dependent on the sort of flexibility and consistency provided to its workers by live-in caregivers,” says Dorow.
Temporary foreign workers can also be found at Canadian Tire and Sobeys. Some, such as Luis, 49, drive trucks loaded with water to surrounding work camps. Others help to build the work camps or are employed as cleaners and housekeeping staff in the camps.

The Athabasca river flows past the growing suburbs of Fort McMurray, Alta. Temporary foreign workers have helped propel the city's booming economy, but recent rule changes have made it harder for them to stay on a long-term basis.

Most of the temporary foreign workers in Fort McMurray are from the Philippines, often sending money to their children and families back home.
Jonathan, 34, came to Canada five years ago and became a Canadian citizen in July. The truck driver says he sends 40 per cent of his earnings to the Philippines because his brother needs kidney dialysis.
He and 10 guest workers live in a small bungalow near the city centre. They pay rent totalling $5,800 a month.
Alma was a cleaner in Fort Mac. Even though she had worked in Canada for four years, she was sent back to the Philippines earlier this year after the federal government revised guest worker rules.
Before she left, she and some co-workers filed a complaint with their employer about overtime that was owed. The co-workers were subsequently fired.
Last year, the federal government announced changes to make it more difficult for temporary foreign workers to stay here on a long-term basis. Fort McMurray employers were outraged.
Wayne Bigelow, vice-president of operations for the three Tim Hortons franchises, told Fort McMurray Today that franchises might have to reduce hours and even close on certain days of the week.
“I think it will be mayhem in Fort McMurray if the temporary foreign workers have to leave,” says Jennifer Best, executive director of YMCA community programs.
Best estimates there are 3,500 guest workers in Fort McMurray alone staffing fast food chains, hotels and work camps.
Not everyone is happy about the presence of so many temporary workers. Earlier this year, the Fort McMurray Airport Authority announced it was planning to lay off permanent, unionized cleaning and security staff in favour of hiring guest workers at lower pay.
A telephone poll conducted by Environics on behalf of the Alberta Federation of Labour found 89 per cent of respondents were opposed to the plan. Fifty-four per cent thought the airport CEO should be fired.
In the end, the workers were laid off and offered their jobs back at a lower rate. And the new contractor was encouraged to hire Canadians first.
Temporary foreign workers may have become a necessity in Fort McMurray, but they are not always popular.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Toronto Star,09-04-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/atkinsonseries/2015/09/04/temporary-foreign-workers-help-drive-fort-mcmurrays-24-7-economy.html,11-15-2015
0,New law gives Ottawa the power to revoke citizenship of those convicted of serious crimes,"The federal government says it now has the power to revoke the citizenship of some Canadians convicted of terrorism, treason or espionage.
A controversial new law, first introduced last June, went into effect on Friday.
The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration says there are several serious crimes that could result in dual citizens losing their Canadian status.
The ministry says it would revoke citizenship for anyone found guilty of terrorism, treason and high treason, and spying for a foreign government.
The rules would also apply to dual citizens who take up arms against Canada by fighting in a foreign army or joining an international terrorist organization.
The new law has met with strong public criticism, and two Ontario lawyers have already launched a court case arguing it is unconstitutional.
Immigration Minister Chris Alexander argued the new rules are meant to confront what he described as the “ever-evolving threat of jihadi terrorism.”
“Our government knows that there is no higher purpose for any government than to ensure the safety and security of its citizens and we have never been afraid to call jihadi terrorism exactly what it is,” Alexander said Friday in Toronto.
He said the changes to the Citizenship Act will ensure that “those who wish to do us harm will not be able to exploit their Canadian citizenship to endanger Canadians or our free and democratic way of life.”
Critics have expressed concerns about the way in which the new law could be applied to certain high-profile cases.
When they were first announced, the New Democrats extracted a promise from the government that the new rules would not be used to target Egyptian-Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy, who was then a dual citizen.
Fahmy was convicted of supporting a terrorist group in a widely-denounced trial held in Egypt and was originally sentenced to seven years.
The Al Jazeera television producer later gave up his Egyptian citizenship in an unsuccessful bid to be deported back to Canada and is currently undergoing a new trial on terrorism charges.
In a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair argued that Fahmy’s case highlighted the risks inherent in the new legislation.
In October, Toronto-based lawyers Paul Slansky and Rocco Galati launched a constitutional court challenge against the new law. Federal Court Judge Donald Rennie dismissed the case earlier this year.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Toronto Star,05-29-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/05/29/new-law-gives-ottawa-the-power-to-revoke-citizenship-of-those-convicted-of-serious-crimes.html,11-15-2015
0,Stephen Harper denies report his office vetted refugee applications,"OTTAWA—Conservative Leader Stephen Harper says his government ordered an audit of Syrian refugees admitted to Canada to ensure security concerns were being addressed but has denied a report that his political staff were involved in vetting and approving applications.
The plight of Syrian refugees — and Canada’s response to the crisis — blew up on the campaign trail Thursday with a report that Conservatives delayed the intake of vulnerable refugees from war-torn Syria in the spring as the prime minister’s office got directly involved in processing immigration files.
The Globe and Mail reported that the Prime Minister’s Office intervened in the processing of Syrian refugees and declared that all applicants referred by the United Nations would require Harper’s approval.
Such files are normally handled by Citizenship and Immigration officials.
CTV News, quoting Citizenship and Immigration insiders, reported Thursday night that the PMO went through Syrian refugee applications to ensure that religious minorities such as Christians were being accepted over applications from Shia and Sunni Muslims.
The Conservatives told CTV that potential security threats prompted the delay of applications. But Citizenship and Immigration sources told the network that politics were also an influencing factor.

CTV reported that PMO staff reviewed the files to ensure the right refugees were accepted, such as those with established communities in Canada, which Conservatives could hopefully attract into their fold.
Earlier Thursday, Harper strenuously denied the suggestion that his staff were involved, saying they had no role in approving applications.
“Political staff are never involved in approving refugee applications. Such decisions are made by officials in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration,” Harper said at the start of a speech to a Vancouver-area audience.
The Globe and Mail also reported that the intake of Syrian refugees was paused as the government did an audit of the initial batch of 1,300 refugees accepted into the country.
Only UN-referred refugee files were audited as the government knows less about those cases when they arrive for processing than they do about refugees being brought to Canada by private groups, said a government source speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the system, Canadian Press reported.
Harper confirmed his office asked for an audit to confirm the government’s goals were being met.
“Our government has adopted a generous approach to the admission of refugees while ensuring the selection of the most vulnerable people and keeping our country safe and secure,” Harper said.
Harper said his office asked for an audit to ensure “these policy objectives are being met.
An official told the Star Thursday that the audit was sparked in part by open reports and intelligence reports raised concerns that Islamic State fighters were “actively” trying to infiltrate the flood of migrants and make their way to western countries.
“That is a very real concern,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The audit meant a pause of the intake of government-sponsored refugees for several weeks, but private sponsorships continued uninterrupted, the official said.
He said the audit was a “look at the process, not the worthiness of any particular file.”
Still, Harper’s political rivals were quick to jump on reports of his alleged involvement, warning that it may have delayed help to desperate refugees.
“Now, we learn it was Stephen Harper, himself, who prevented the arrival of Syrian families into Canada in the worst Syrian refugee crisis since World War II,” NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said during a morning campaign stop in Toronto.
Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said the news report was further proof of Harper’s meddling instincts and said it was another reason to toss the Conservatives out of government in the coming election.
Loly Rico, president of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the latest news could explain why Canada has been slow to accept refugees fleeing the civil war-torn country.
“Now, it’s understandable how low numbers on the resettlement will come in this year, because they delayed the process of selection, and also they’re selecting what type of refugees they (want),” Rico told the Star.
Lorne Waldman of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers said the PMO’s alleged intervention strongly suggested that it was the Conservative government’s plan to only take in Christian minorities from war-torn Syria.
“Canada’s response to the crisis had been pathetic because we’d been preventing people from coming,” Waldman said.
According to Waldman, all refugee applicants have to undergo security checks and some are then referred to an “enhanced security check,” if they fall under certain profiles, based on age or personal history.
Hanna Al-Khoulani of Mississauga have been waiting for 18 months on her refugee sponsorship for her nephew now stranded in Ivory Coast; she said she was surprised to learn Ottawa had put a hold on the government-assisted refugee program amid the PMO audit.
“The government has to do what it has to do, but they should have informed the public about it instead of keeping it a secret. That said, they should have continued the processing while they were doing the audit,” she said. “Any delay is unacceptable because so many people’s lives are in their hands.”
Ratna Omidvar, of Lifeline Syria and Global Diversity Exchange, said that political interference on individual files would be “highly unusual” especially since the United Nations refugee agency has already vetted the cases.
She said the cases referred to Canada for settlement are usually “highly vulnerable.”
“So a family in some gravity of danger is being left in limbo when it should be in safety,” Omidvar said. “The real issue is how fast we can bring refugees in fear of their lives to safety.”
Brian Dyck, chair of the Council of The Canadian Refugee Sponsorship Agreement Holders Association, said his group had been asking immigration officials since last year why there were so few profiles of Syrians in the selected pool for resettlement.
“We had no idea they had stopped processing UNHCR referred cases. There was no hint of a concern about security in our conversations,” Dyck told the Star.
Immigration Minister Chris Alexander said that the intake of refugees was paused so the government could ensure that “appropriate referral and screening procedures” were in place.
“Starting a new refugee resettlement program in a volatile conflict zone poses particular challenges,” Alexander said in a statement provided to the Star.
He called it a “prudent” step to ensure the integrity of the refugee system.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Toronto Star,08-10-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/10/08/prime-ministers-office-delayed-intake-of-syrian-refugees-report-says.html,11-16-2015
0,Former MP Dean Del Mastro gets month in jail for election fraud,"PETERBOROUGH, ONT.—A former MP who spoke for Prime Minister Stephen Harper when it came to electoral-fraud allegations was sentenced Thursday to one month in jail and barred from running for office for five years for “cheating” during an election campaign.
Dean Del Mastro deliberately broke spending rules then tried to cover up his crime, said Superior Court Justice Lisa Cameron, who ruled that incarceration was appropriate for the first-time offender.
“He was prepared not only to break the rules but to be deceitful about it,” Cameron said.
“This type of cheating and lying will result in serious sanctions.”
Cameron convicted the former Conservative MP for Peterborough last fall of violating the Canada Elections Act during the 2008 federal election. She found he had knowingly exceeded spending limits, failed to report a personal contribution of $21,000 to his campaign, and submitted a falsified document.
The offences were the very “antithesis” of democracy and an “affront” to the principles of Canada’s democratic system, Cameron said.

“Custody is required to reflect the need for denunciation and deterrence.”
Cameron refused a defence request to allow him to serve his jail time intermittently.
In addition to two one-month jail terms he will have to serve concurrently for the overspending, Cameron also imposed four months of house arrest, to start after he is released, for the false return he filed.
He will also have to pay $10,000 to the Peterborough Electoral District Association, and will be on probation for 18 months.
Del Mastro, 44, has already filed an appeal of the conviction and was to apply for bail at a hearing Friday. He was led away after the sentencing in handcuffs and shackles before being taken to a jail in nearby Lindsay. His wife was in tears.

Accountant Richard McCarthy, 68, who was Del Mastro’s agent, was given a two-month conditional sentence plus one year of probation for his role. Cameron said McCarthy had acquiesced to the machinations — or at least was “wilfully blind” to them — but was much less culpable.
Once Harper’s point man defending the Tories against allegations of electoral fraud, Del Mastro has maintained his innocence and once called the verdict the judge’s opinion. Going into the day’s proceedings, he said he was not worried by the prospect of a jail term.
“I prefer to do whatever’s necessary to stand for the truth,” he said.
In Ottawa, the New Democrats called Del Mastro the man Harper “handpicked” to be his party’s spokesman on ethics and noted other Tories have also been convicted for electoral fraud.
“Conservatives have now been convicted of cheating in every election they won,” the NDP said in a statement.
Michael Sona, a former Conservative staffer, was convicted last year in the 2011 robocalls scandal. The Conservative Party pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records in the 2006 election.
Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel said he didn’t think Del Mastro’s conviction and sentence would affect the Conservative banner.
“I think Canadians will be able to make the distinction between an individual and a political party,” he said in Quebec City.
Following the sentencing, Del Mastro’s lawyer expressed disappointment at the punishment. His client, Leo Adler said, was stunned.
“It’s a shock to anybody who has gone through their life without a single criminal blemish to all of a sudden be told that you have to go to jail,” Adler said outside court.
Prosecutor Tom Lemon said justice had been served by imprisoning Del Mastro.
“Anything short of that would not have adequately denounced these offences,” Lemon said.
Del Mastro resigned his Peterborough seat in the House of Commons — where he had been sitting as an Independent since being charged — shortly after his conviction.
Adler said the appeal would be based on “substantial errors” made by the trial judge.
Cameron said she took the impact of the negative publicity visited on Del Mastro and his family into account in crafting his punishment. But at least one local man, sitting at the courthouse, said he would vote for Del Mastro if he ran as an Independent.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Toronto Star,06-26-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/06/25/convicted-former-mp-del-mastro-finds-out-if-he-goes-to-jail.html,11-16-2015
0,Minister at heart of Syrian boy controversy is rising star in Harper’s cabinet,"The Conservative candidate who finds himself at the centre of controversy over Canada’s response to the European refugee crisis is a respected former diplomat who is considered a rising star in Stephen Harper’s government.
Chris Alexander, the candidate for Ajax-Pickeringand Harper’s minister of citizenship and immigration, temporarily dropped his re-election campaign on Thursdayafter poignant photos Alan Kurdi, a Syrian boy who drowned off the coast of Turkey, were seen around the world. In an email to the Star, Alexander said he was returning to Ottawa to be briefed on the migrant crisis.
A call to Alexander’s campaign headquarters Thursday was answered by a staffer who said that the office was “fully operational” while Alexander was away. “We’re here, we have door knockers out,” said campaign worker Stephanie Keron.
Before entering politics, Alexander, 46, made a name for himself in the world of international diplomacy. He worked in the foreign service for 18 years, posted first to Moscow and later Afghanistan, where he became Canada’s first resident ambassador.
After meeting his wife and starting a family in Kabul, in 2009 he quit diplomacy to return to Canada, where he decided to run for office. In 2011, he beat Liberal incumbent Mark Holland to become MP for the riding of Ajax-Pickering, and despite his age and inexperience as an MP, was appointed to cabinet two years later.
As minister of citizenship and immigration he presided over sweeping reforms to Canada’s immigration system that he said were necessary to eliminate fraud and wasteful spending, but that were heavily criticized by refugee advocates and opposition parties. The reforms included reducing social assistance to refugees, and imposing stricter conditions on obtaining Canadian citizenship. One reform, which limited refugee claimants’ access to public health care, was struck down last year by the Federal Court, which deemed it “cruel and unusual.”
Alexander stood by the changes to Canada’s immigration regime, however, telling the Star last year: “Canadians are proud of the reforms we’ve brought to the immigration system. It’s far better now than it was in 2006.”
On Wednesday night, as photos of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi’s lifeless bodywere already being seen around the world, Alexander defended Canada’s response to the refugee crisis on the CBC, saying the country is “a model of humanitarian action” and was “dramatically” increasing the number of refugees from Iraq and Syria that it would take in.
“We are continuing to act, to be at the forefront of humanitarian response,” he said.
NDP candidate Fin Donnelly told The Canadian Press that the Kurdi family had been trying to come to Canada, and Donnelly had personally asked Alexander to look into the case. The child’s aunt, Tima Kurdi, lives in B.C., and later told the press she had unsuccessfully tried to bring one of her brothers, Mohamad, to Canada, but had never applied to help Alan’s family travel here. Alan was the son of her brother Abdullah. Abdullah’s wife and their 5-year-old son, Ghalib, also perished off the Turkish coast.
Alexander returned to CBC television on Thursday and acknowledged that Donnelly had given him a letter from Tima Kurdi regarding Mohamad’s application. Alexander said he “noted that there was urgency” to the letter but that he didn’t interfere in the application process.
“I have a responsibility as a minister not to be personally involved in decisions,” he said, “to ensure that they are all treated equally.”
According to immigration officials, Mohamad’s application was returned as incomplete because it didn’t contain proof of his refugee status from the UNHCR or a foreign country.
Alexander denied media reports that the Canadian government had offered Abdullah citizenship after learning of his family’s fate. Alexander said it would be inappropriate for him to personally offer Abdullah assistance, but stated, “Our visa programs, our visitor programs, and our refugee programs are available to all Syrians.”",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Toronto Star,09-03-2014,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/03/minister-at-heart-of-syrian-boy-controversy-was-rising-star-in-harpers-cabinet.html,11-16-2015
0,Lockheed Martin to Buy Sikorsky Aircraft for $9 Billion,"Lockheed Martin‘s $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter manufacturer, is part of a larger effort at Lockheed to focus more intently on military hardware than on less profitable government services.

At the same time that it announced on Monday that it would buy Sikorsky from the United Technologies Corporation, Lockheed also said that it would consider spinning off or selling much of its business that provides information technology services to government agencies.

Lockheed said those parts of its business employ 17,000 people and earn roughly $6 billion in annual sales — much of it coming from federal agencies outside the military and intelligence communities.

That business generally has lower profit margins than Lockheed’s more traditional work of building satellites, warplanes and missiles, and its sales have dropped in recent years as the government has cut spending on information technology and encouraged more competition from smaller firms. Lockheed said it would continue to supply technical services to military and intelligence customers.

The deal for Sikorsky, which makes the popular Black Hawk helicopters and is based in Stratford, Conn., would further bolster Lockheed’s status as the world’s biggest military contractor by adding another major business line to its varied lines of military equipment, including the F-35 fighter jet.

The transaction will be structured in a way that generates a tax benefit of about $1.9 billion for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, effectively reducing the purchase price to $7.1 billion, Lockheed says.

The Sikorsky business, which had been part of United Technologies for decades, recorded net sales of $7.5 billion in 2014 and employed more than 15,000 people.

Marillyn Hewson, chairwoman, president and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said in a news release that Sikorsky was “a natural fit” for Lockheed Martin, which had worked on helicopter projects with Sikorsky but did not build helicopters on its own. She added that Lockheed’s reconsideration of its technology services businesses stemmed from the “recent shifts in market dynamics.”

The Sikorsky deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by late fourth quarter 2015 or early first quarter 2016.

The combination of Lockheed and Sikorsky will most likely be scrutinized by the United State Defense Department, which has indicated that it wants to preserve competition among military contractors. Ms. Hewson told analysts on Monday that the company did not expect to run into government opposition since the deal would not reduce the number of companies that make military helicopters.

Boeing, Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, which is headquartered in Italy, also build helicopters for the Pentagon.

Lockheed says it expects to add Sikorsky to its Mission Systems and Training business segment after the deal. Sikorsky’s commercial helicopter business has suffered recently, as the drop in oil prices has cut into its business with oil and gas companies.

Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, told analysts on Monday that he expected Sikorsky’s business to turn around over the next several years.

The sale came after a review of strategic alternatives for the 90-year-old Sikorsky business that United Technologies conducted this year.

In June, United Technologies said that it was considering selling or spinning off the business this year. That same month, Sikorsky said that it planned to cut up to 1,400 jobs, or about 9 percent of its work force.

Divesting itself of Sikorsky would help simplify the business mix of United Technologies, whose products include Otis elevators, Carrier air-conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines.

Based in Hartford, United Technologies posted net sales of $65.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.

Founded on Long Island in 1925, Sikorsky manufactures and services military and commercial helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. In 1929, it was acquired by the predecessor of United Technologies, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation.

In addition to Black Hawks, Sikorsky makes a range of commercial and military helicopters, including the S-76 and the S-92 commercial helicopters and the Seahawk military helicopter. It is also developing the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter for the Marine Corps and the HH-60W combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force.

Last year, Sikorsky won the contract to build the next generation of Marine One helicopters, which are used to transport the president.

Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., produces a wide variety of military and aerospace equipment. It posted net sales of $45.6 billion in 2014.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,New York Times,07-20-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/business/dealbook/lockheed-martin-to-buy-sikorsky-aircraft-for-9-billion.html,11-16-2015
0,Prison Vendors See Continued Signs of a Captive Market,"Is there anything that cannot be turned into a weapon? Walk around the exhibitors’ hall at the conference of the American Correctional Association, held in Indianapolis in early August, and at some point the question will answer itself. Apparently, with enough malign intent and the right tools — a lighter, for instance — even disposable plates can be transformed into shivs.

“This is a piece of Styrofoam, rolled, then heated, then rolled and heated some more,” said Michael Robertson, salesman for a company called JonesZylon. He handed over a dark brown, six-inch spike that looked nothing like a piece of Styrofoam. Touch its sharpened end and it felt like the tip of a blade.

“Now this,” he continued, handing over a plastic JonesZylon serving tray, “you can’t weaponize.”

The tray is part of an extensive line of plastic kitchen products, including cups, plates and bowls, sold by the company. You will find these in just about every federal prison, Mr. Robertson said. They can’t be rolled and heated into anything harmful, and if inmates throw them at you, they will not inflict much pain.

“You’d definitely feel it,” he said.

“But,” a colleague said, “it won’t penetrate the skin.”

Mr. Robertson was one of 264 vendors in booths at the Indiana Convention Center for what is essentially a trade show for the prison industry. It is the shiny, customer-friendly face of a fairly grim business. The A.C.A. accredits jails and prisons and is also the country’s largest association for the corrections field, with a membership filled with wardens and state and county correctional administrators.

The convention is where those people window-shop. The United States currently imprisons about 2.2 million people, making it the world’s largest jailer. Those in charge of this immense population need stuff: food, gas masks, restraints, riot gear, handcuffs, clothing, suicide prevention vests, health care systems, pharmacy systems, commissary services — the list goes on. These outlays are a small fraction of the roughly $80 billion spent annually on incarceration, though precise sales figures are hard to come by because most companies in this niche market are private. Two publicly traded players, the private prison operators Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO Group, have a combined market capitalization of almost $5.8 billion. Both companies had booths in Indianapolis.


For prison vendors, this would appear to be a historically awful moment. Sentencing reform has been gaining momentum as a growing number of diverse voices conclude that the tough-on-crime ethos that was born 40 years ago, and that led to a 700 percent increase in the prison population since 1970, went too far. Mandatory minimum laws, many of them passed at the state and federal level in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s locked people away for decades, often for relatively minor, nonviolent offenses. Those laws have had a disproportionate impact on African-Americans, who tend to serve longer sentences than whites.

For families, the results have been devastating. Former inmates are stigmatized and have a far harder time finding jobs, causing incalculable social and economic damage. And a paucity of rehabilitation programs keeps many former criminals ensnared. Nearly three out of four inmates offend again after five years.

The first stirrings of sentencing overhaul happened five years ago, around the time that California’s prison system was so bursting with inmates that a federal court called the conditions unconstitutional and mandated reductions. Texas has stepped up its use of community supervision programs and drug courts. For the first time in state history, it has closed prisons — three of them. The point is to save money, as former Gov. Rick Perry underscored time and again.

More recently, for reasons both humanitarian and fiscal, the notion of changing sentencing laws has gone national. At a time when congressional Democrats and Republicans agree on almost nothing, there is a rare political consensus that the criminal justice system needs to try something other than severity. In July, when President Obama called on Congress to pass laws that would slash mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders, the response was essentially “We’re already on it.” Bills like the Smarter Sentencing Act have support across the spectrum, from Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois on the left to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on the right.

My goal ambling through the oddly colorful bazaar in Indianapolis for three days was to see what effect — if any — this much discussed change was having on the hard-nosed bottom line. Was anyone here experiencing a slump, or even bracing for one? Nobody wants businesses to suffer financially, but if you think the current incarceration system is a calamity, there is no way around it: Bad news for these companies is good news for the country. And if change was coming, or had already arrived, these vendors would be among the first to know.

I had no idea what I would find. But a few days before the exhibition doors opened, I spoke on the telephone to a skeptic, a guy who just didn’t believe that the country was really on the verge of a correctional system makeover.

“It’s hard for me not to be cynical about it,” said Jack Cowley, a retired warden who lives in Oklahoma. “Think about the size of our system, all the judges and lawyers, putting their kids through college, people that make leg irons, Tasers. Crime is driving the train. It’s like a business that is too big to fail.”

Prison in Lime and Mango

The A.C.A. bills its conferences as events offering “multiple ways to network with industry professionals, find a mentor, get a sneak peek at emerging technology and hone your leadership skills.” This sounds like any other conference in any other industry, and in many ways it was. Many booths were staffed by average-looking men standing beside strikingly attractive women. There were a lot of polo shirts stitched with company names. Branded tchotchkes, like pens and key chains, were laid out for the taking. A raffle for a Chevy Cruze was held on the final day. A woman fell to her knees in joy when she won.

Beyond the familiar conference format, however, things got weirder. Secure, a Mexican company that sells bulletproof glass, showed a video in which the company’s president stood behind his product — while it was repeatedly shot at with a gun. The guy tried to look nonchalant by puffing on a cigarette.

The event was open to the media, though for reasons that were never clear, news photographers were barred from the exhibit hall. While A.C.A. doesn’t want the industry shrouded in mystery, it is not eager for a close-up either. This might stem from less-than-flattering attention the conference has received in the past. A documentary called “Profits of Punishment,” released in 2001, included a stroll through the A.C.A. exhibitors’ hall, where vendors boasted a little too proudly of the effectiveness of their merchandise. One woman talked about the 600 stitches an inmate needed after an encounter with her company’s barbed wire. The film captures an industry relishing a boom.

“The growth in the corrections population here in the United States will probably double in the next 10 years,” one vendor says on film, clearly pleased. “They’re building just about as fast as they can.”

In Indianapolis this summer, there were the ingratiating smiles that are always part of sales, but nobody seemed giddy. Concern about sentencing reform was in the air, but more than a few vendors seemed to regard the trend as a business opportunity.

Bob Barker started selling supplies to prisons in 1972, which, coincidentally, was the same year that a gentleman with the same name started hosting a certain television game show. Though the two look nothing alike, he has been confused for the more famous Bob Barker for so long he has stopped correcting people.

“Guy was just over here who said, ‘I’ve followed you since you were on ‘Truth or Consequences!’ ” Mr. Barker reported with a smile. “I said, ‘I appreciate that.’ ”

When Mr. Barker founded his company, he met a lot of incredulous wardens.

“I would go into jails and start talking toothbrushes and deodorant and I’d get, ‘What do you think this is, a Holiday Inn?’ If somebody didn’t bring you underwear or a toothbrush you didn’t get it.”

Then the drug culture grew, and detention professionals realized that to prevent the flow of drugs into prisons, they had to stop visitors from handing anything to inmates. When that happened, they started buying from Mr. Barker, who today sells about 5,000 different items, making him the largest detention supplier in the country. His inventory includes laundry bags, boots, board games and something called the BarkerBunk, described as “the toughest stackable correctional specific inmate bunk.”

Mr. Barker would not say much about his company’s financial performance in the last two or three years, other than to describe it as “sort of flat.” He seems unbothered by that, noting that the industry provided his family with a good living for 40 years. But his son, Robert Barker, who is the company’s president, was standing next to him, and he sounded anything but defeatist.

“We’re looking long term at how we can be part of the solution,” the younger Mr. Barker said. “With more re-entry programs out there, we’re looking at future supply opportunities.”

There was a foray into house arrest ankle monitors, but a couple of conglomerates moved into that field and the Bob Barker Company got out. Since then, the company has been pumping 10 percent of company profits into research in a hunt for new ventures. So far, the elder Mr. Barker says he has only a few vague ideas. As he put it, “We haven’t found the silver bullet.”

Like Bob Barker, many companies are trying to diversify. In 2013, Corrections Corporation of America, the country’s largest private prison company, purchased Correctional Alternatives, which specializes in re-entry programs, like work furloughs and home confinement.

“We have continued to look for opportunities in this service area,” a spokesman for C.C.A. wrote in an email. “It aligns with the needs of our government partners, who are increasingly looking to this type of solution.”

Many at this conference were what could be called platform agnostic, including Norix, which describes itself as the country’s largest maker of prison furniture. Its slogan is “Engineered to endure,” and to illustrate the point, the company ran a looping video at its booth featuring inventive assaults on its furniture. One snippet featured a vinyl armchair being slowly squashed down to 10 inches high by a pneumatic crusher.

When the machine slowly uncrushed the chair, it retook its original shape.

“Sales to prisons are flat to down,” said Sandy Heitman, a senior project manager. “But more people are being put into mental health facilities, and that portion of the business has increased.” The same is true, she added, of halfway houses.

We sat on some Norix furniture, which was the opposite of the austere, steel slabs you see in prison documentaries. Norix still makes that style of product, but it was highlighting a vinyl collection that comes in lively colors that the company calls lime, mango, orchid and reef. The furniture is intended to be more “humanizing,” a word that is prominent on the company’s website.

“This is a more healing environment,” Ms. Heitman said, gesturing to the products.

As she spoke, the video showed a man in a lab coat jackhammering a chair.

What Reductions?

The A.C.A. was started as the National Prison Association in 1870 by a group of wardens who thought the justice system needed to emphasize reform and rehabilitation. At its opening session, the group’s chairman lamented that prisons “do not work that reformation in the soul of man that will restore him to society regenerated and reformed.” By 1971, the group had been renamed and its annual conference was more about tear gas and stun guns than the souls of men, as detailed in Jessica Mitford’s book “Kind and Usual Punishment.”

Halcyon days lay ahead. There was a succession of tough-on-crime presidents, including Bill Clinton, who signed a bill in 1994, which he recently renounced, that lengthened sentences. The ’80s and ’90s were good decades for what is ominously referred to as the prison-industrial complex. In 2005, an article in Prison Legal News about an A.C.A. conference described an almost festive atmosphere. At one point, a young woman in a pink top and silk net stockings gave free shoe shines, courtesy of Aramark, the food giant.

That scene is hard to imagine now. Many of the attendees were women. And if your idea of a prison official is lifted from pop culture — say, “Orange Is the New Black” or “The Shawshank Redemption” — you would be disappointed. When attendees were not roaming the exhibitors hall, they sat through a variety of earnest workshops with titles like “College Behind Bars: Too Soft or Very Sensible?” (very sensible, according to two academics from Boston University). In another, “Defining Serious Mental Illness in Corrections,” the audience was split into groups and asked to refine a definition of serious mental illness. My group spent the entire time in a meta-debate about the debate.

During the conference, there was a sign-up sheet for tours of local correctional facilities. This initially sounded ridiculous, the ultimate busman’s holiday, but the tours were overbooked. I snagged a spot for a visit to the nearby Marion County Jail. It started with a group of about 25 people climbing aboard what felt like a maximum-security minibus. Incongruously, Foreigner’s “Hot Blooded” was playing over loudspeakers.

I asked a prison warden why on earth she wanted to spend her free time in a jail.

“Best practices,” she said, brightly. “See what other places are doing.”

The only moments of the tour that were not dreary and kind of heartbreaking came when I spotted products from vendors in the exhibition hall. That is Norix! That is JonesZylon! Early on, we were introduced to a staff seamstress mending a suicide prevention vest made by Bob Barker.

The Marion County Jail, our guide explained, is at capacity and recently sent some inmates to a nearby site operated by C.C.A., the private incarceration company. This speaks to a big reason that vendors in Indianapolis seem unruffled by talk of prison reform. It hasn’t had a big impact, at least not yet, and it doesn’t seem that it will in the future.

To understand the “not yet” part, consider California, site of the country’s most ambitious inmate reductions. The court-ordered program to ease cramped, triple-bunk conditions started in October 2011. To date, the system’s head count in the 34 facilities covered by the overcrowding litigation has dropped to 111,000, from 144,000.

But the numbers aren’t quite what they seem. The law passed in 2011 mandated that new offenders sentenced for nonviolent or nonsex crimes would serve their time in county jails. The days when a jail was a just a pretrial holding pen are over, and the population in those cells is starting to bulge. Yes, there has been a net decline in the total population of incarcerated people in the state. Just not at a rate that would alarm anyone selling, say, inmate blankets.

“These declines are too small,” said Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative, which campaigns for prison reform. “The numbers are trending downward, but slowly and not consistently.”

Mr. Wagner also doubted that prison reform laws knocking around Congress, as well as many states, would reduce the prison population as much as some people thought, because they are focused on drug and nonviolent offenders. As numbers collected by the Urban Institute demonstrate, half of all inmates in state prisons are violent offenders, and state prisons are home to 86 percent of the nation’s inmates.

Yet it is hard to find a politician talking about sentencing reform for violent offenders, a subject that is demonstrably and understandably contentious. In Arkansas, the state eased laws for parolees in 2011, trying to cope with budget issues. Two years later, a man with a history of parole violations and aggravated robbery and theft convictions shot and killed an 18-year-old in Little Rock. The state’s board of corrections swiftly enacted new and tougher standards.

“It changed everything,” said Dina Tyler of Arkansas Community Correction, as she stood outside the exhibition hall. “They started bringing parolees in by the truckload.” This month, state corrections officials reported that 19,055 inmates were under state jurisdiction, the largest number in Arkansas history. The prison population is also rising in dozens of states.
Against this backdrop, the relative serenity of vendors in Indianapolis made sense. Still, if you looked in the right places, the event quietly reflected a change in attitude that should hearten supporters of reform. For years, attendees said, the only people at these conferences talking about rehabilitation or the well-being of inmates were faith-based groups like the Salvation Army. This time, there were workshops on re-entry success stories and alternative sentencing for juveniles, and many others like it.

There were also companies in the exhibition room selling products aimed at improving the lives of inmates. One of them, JPay, markets a gadget that looks like a small iPad ready for a riot. It’s encased in a plastic shell and can survive a 30-foot drop. It doesn’t connect to the Internet, but it does allow monitored access to music and email. The company markets it as an efficient way for inmates to nurture connections with the outside world. Currently, it is in detention facilities in 14 states.

“It keeps them engaged; it keeps them from fighting,” said the company’s head of marketing, Jade Trombetta. “If I send an email that says, ‘I’m going to shank this guy, he’s screwing with me,’ Mom writes back: ‘Don’t. You have one year left. You shank the guy, you’re going to add two years to your sentence.’ That stuff helps.”",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,New York Times,08-29-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/business/prison-vendors-see-continued-signs-of-a-captive-market.html,11-16-2015
0,Google Loses to LinkedIn in Silicon Valley Headquarters Pitch,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Early this year, Google unveiled renderings of several clear, tent-like buildings that would replace its current Silicon Valley headquarters, known as the “Googleplex.” Renderings may be about as far as the idea is likely to go.

In a blow to Google’s expansion plans, on Tuesday the Mountain View City Council voted to give the search giant roughly a quarter of the office space it had requested for the project, and instead awarded the lion’s share of the city’s future office development –- 1.5 million square feet –- to LinkedIn.

Google received about 500,000 square feet, or about enough to build one of the four buildings it had proposed.

“We know the City Council had a tough decision to make last night and thank them and our community for more than six hours of debate,” said David Radcliffe, Google’s vice president of real estate, in an emailed statement. He added that the company would “continue to work with the City on Google’s future in Mountain View.”

The vote was part of a years-long plan for how to redevelop Mountain View’s North Bayshore area, a mass of low-slung office parks that surrounds Google’s headquarters and is separated from Mountain View proper by Highway 101. At issue was how to allot just over 2 million square feet of future office space, as well as how to build more housing –- particularly affordable housing –- in a region that badly needs it.

Underscoring this, during an earlier portion of the meeting several Mountain View residents, including a Google engineer named Brandon Jones, protested their imminent eviction from a townhouse development that was recently acquired by a developer.

Google’s proposal was to tear down parts of its campus and replace it with a series of airy buildings with translucent roofs and modular interiors that could be moved around and reconfigured like Lego bricks. It was designed by a superstar duo of Heatherwick Studio, a London design firm known for works like the fiery caldron at the 2012 Olympics, and Bjarke Ingels, a Danish architect known for his innovative designs.

For LinkedIn, it was a David vs. Goliath victory that was the result of several savvy moves and a project that was ambitious but not too ambitious. At the same time, it showed how Google’s size –- it is the city’s largest taxpayer, largest employer and owns three Empire State buildings worth of Mountain View real estate –- has become a liability in its hometown.

Indeed, one of LinkedIn’s selling points was that it would “preserve business diversity,” meaning it would reduce Mountain View’s dependence on Google.

LinkedIn currently leases just under 400,000 square feet in North Bayshore, with a lease that runs out in 2023. Hoping to stay in the area, last year it bought a seven-acre parcel with hopes of developing a new mixed-use development in partnership with a local developer who owns the adjacent land.

That land “is the singular place in Mountain View where we could eventually develop and have enough space for our company without being encumbered by expensive leases, with rates being driven by companies larger and growing faster than ours,” said Jim Morgensen, LinkedIn’s vice president of global workplace services, in his 10-minute presentation to the council.

Compared to Google’s clear, space-age headquarters, LinkedIn’s proposal, called the Shoreline Commons, was quite modest. It would be a cluster of offices and retail, including a movie theater and a gym with a pool and a basketball court, along with several bike and pedestrian paths. But modesty was part of the pitch.

“We are doing this without asking for any variances in heights or density, with a project that can be built now with existing technology and union labor,” Mr. Morgensen told the council. It was a not-so-veiled reference to Google’s plan, which required height exceptions and engineering technologies that have not yet been developed.

LinkedIn also made the savvy move of partnering with an affordable housing developer, which aims to build new housing projects nearby. Google also had plans to develop housing and is still likely play a role in whatever housing plan emerges, as it owns most of the land in North Bayshore.

Despite the vote, this may not be the end of Google’s hope to build something new. They could still tear down some of their property and rebuild to a smaller footprint than what they asked for on Tuesday. Also, the council has set up a process for developers to ask for more office space in the future, so long as it doesn’t add traffic to the area.

“The numbers last night are not the end of the story,” said Ken Rosenberg, a Mountain View city councilman who last night voted to delay the process until housing can be added.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,New York Times,05-06-2015,http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/google-loses-to-linkedin-in-silicon-valley-headquarters-pitch/,11-16-2015
0,New York Attorney General Accuses Brooklyn Children’s Charity of Fraud,"Over the years, donors gave millions of dollars to the National Children’s Leukemia Foundation, perhaps motivated by brochures or telemarketing pitches describing the charity’s bone marrow registry or its cancer research building.

Neither of those things existed, the New York State attorney general’s office said in a petition filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Monday.

The petition seeks to shut down the Brooklyn-based foundation and recover money that the attorney general’s office said had been raised fraudulently.

The petition said the foundation had paid exorbitant fees for telemarketing and direct-mail fund-raising campaigns — more than 80 percent of the $9.7 million that the charity collected from mid-2009 to mid-2013. It paid out only $57,451 in “direct cash assistance to leukemia patients” in that time, the documents said.

“Nothing is more shameful than pocketing millions of dollars donated by good-hearted people who just wanted to help children afflicted with a terminal illness,” the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said.

Even the foundation’s Make a Dream Come True program for children with cancer was mostly a mirage, according to investigators. The foundation’s website, which appears to have been taken down last year, said the program arranged family trips and introductions to celebrities. A telemarketing script used in fund-raising efforts said the program sent children to places like Disney World.

But the court petition said the foundation had spent nothing on the program since March 2009, and only $7,866 in 12 months before that.

Investigators said the foundation amounted to a one-man operation doing business from the basement of a home in the Bergen Beach section of Brooklyn.

That one man, the petition said, was Zvi Shor, who started the foundation in 1991 after losing a son to leukemia. The court papers said Mr. Shor, who ran a construction and plumbing business, had paid himself $595,000 in salary and $600,000 in deferred compensation from 2009 to 2013, along with the promise of a lifetime pension of more than $100,000 a year.

The petition illustrated some of the difficulties of regulating nonprofit organizations, a responsibility that falls to the attorney general’s charities bureau. New York State does not have a law making charities fraud a crime, and criminal prosecutions usually involve larceny, embezzlement or tax fraud.

The foundation’s telephone number has been disconnected, and calls to Mr. Shor’s personal line went unanswered on Monday. Mr. Shor’s lawyer, Douglas Gross, said that he had not seen the petition but that Mr. Shor denied any wrongdoing.

“We do not believe that any of the attorney general’s allegations have any substance,” Mr. Gross said. “Mr. Shor began this charity and ran it with the best of intentions.”

Mr. Shor’s title was president of the foundation until 2010, when, the court papers said, he “nominally resigned that position” after it became known that he had been convicted of bank fraud in 1999.

The court papers said Yehuda Gutwein, the foundation’s accountant, became president but Mr. Shor continued to control the decision-making. Mr. Shor remained so much in charge, the court papers said, that Mr. Gutwein did not know who the foundation’s directors were. When lawyers from the charities bureau handed him a list of the directors, he said he had “no idea who these people are.”

Mr. Gutwein, reached for comment on Monday, said his lawyer would be in touch.

The petition said Mr. Shor admitted to investigators that the foundation never had a registry for bone marrow donors. The court papers said the foundation’s activities about bone marrow work “were limited to him encouraging callers to become donors, and referring people to their local blood bank.”

Mr. Shor also claimed the foundation was “banking stem cells” in liquid nitrogen at extremely cold temperatures, the petition said. But he told investigators that the foundation had never collected or stored what is known as cord blood.

The petition said that when Mr. Gutwein became president, Shlomo Donn, who had spent his entire career working for Mr. Gutwein, became the foundation’s accountant. The court papers said that Mr. Donn repeatedly signed financial forms that must be filed with the attorney general’s charities bureau every year, but did no audits.

A call seeking comment on Monday was answered by Mr. Donn’s wife, who said he was not at home and could not be reached.

The petition said the foundation had transferred $655,000 to an Israeli organization that Mr. Shor set up, supposedly for research. Some of the money went to one medical researcher there, the petition said, but the foundation did not provide records showing how much.

In 2012, Mr. Shor and his wife at the time, Susan Gardin, who also worked for the foundation, delivered a PowerPoint presentation in London that showed a building in Israel labeled “Biomedical Cancer Research Center.” But Mr. Shor later told investigators the lettering had been superimposed on the photograph. Ms. Gardin was quoted in the petition as saying that the Israeli organization had bought part of one floor in the building, not the entire building.

The petition also said the foundation had paid for more than $30,000 in personal expenses for Mr. Shor, including $16,615 for gasoline and tolls and $9,000 for supplies used to renovate his house",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,New York Times,07-20-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/nyregion/new-york-attorney-general-accuses-brooklyn-childrens-charity-of-fraud.html,11-16-2015
0,Amazon Chief’s Message to Employees,"After the weekend publication of an article in The New York Times about his company’s management practices, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, sent this message to all employees, linking to the Times article and a counterpoint written on LinkedIn:

Dear Amazonians,

If you haven’t already, I encourage you to give this (very long) New York Times article a careful read.

I also encourage you to read this very different take by a current Amazonian.

Here’s why I’m writing you. The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at jeff@amazon.com. Even if it’s rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero.

The article goes further than reporting isolated anecdotes. It claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. Again, I don’t recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you don’t, either. More broadly, I don’t think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in today’s highly competitive tech hiring market. The people we hire here are the best of the best. You are recruited every day by other world-class companies, and you can work anywhere you want.

I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.

But hopefully, you don’t recognize the company described. Hopefully, you’re having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates, helping invent the future, and laughing along the way.

Thank you,

Starbucks went with their traditional bright red cup, which was promoted by the brand on Twitter.

On social media, Tim Hortons received a great reception for showing girls playing hockey.

0,Quebec invests $1B as Bombardier posts $4.9B loss,"The Quebec government is stepping with a $1 billion (U.S.) cash injection to help Bombardier Inc. get the struggling CSeries jet program off the ground.
But just as company executives touted the investment, which will give Quebec a 49.5 per cent stake in a new joint venture, they acknowledged that the jet program won’t become profitable until 2020 or 2021 at the earliest.
Bombardier will need to spend an additional $2 billion (U.S.) in the coming years before the production line begins to make money. It took a $3.2 billion (U.S.) write-down on Thursday, on the costs of developing the plane, essentially signaling it doesn’t expect to recoup that money.
In Toronto, unionized workers who build the Q400 turboprops at the Downsview plant rejected a proposal that would outsource work on the wing and cockpit to Mexico and China.
The company is looking for ways to cut costs and be more competitive – especially since rival ATR, a joint French-Italian venture, has been drastically cutting prices, said union leader Merv Gray.
Gray said he endorsed a plan to offer buyouts to about 200 employees as a part of a strategy to protect assembly jobs in Toronto. But it was soundly rejected by 70 per cent of the Unifor Local 112 membership on the weekend.
“It was short-term pain for long-term pain,” he said. “We took a responsible position for the long-term viability of the program.”
Bombardier spokeswoman Marianella de la Barrera declined to comment on specific discussions, saying only that “we are looking at various initiatives to make our products more competitive.”
Quebec Economy Minister Jacques Daoust told reporters in Montreal that the aeronautics industry is the crown jewel in Quebec’s economy, noting salaries are double the provincial average.
George Ferguson, senior aerospace analyst for Bloomberg Industries, said the move will give Bombardier the chance “to fight another day,” but big questions still remain.
“It’s good to find someone to put the money in, but it hurts the existing shareholders, who spent a lot of money,” he said, adding the Quebec government picks up half of the CSeries program for $1 billion.
The agreement gives Quebec a direct say in the development of the CSeries plane as well as a 20-year guarantee Bombardier will keep its headquarters and its manufacturing and engineering facilities in the province.
That’s assuming the orders for the 100- to-150 seat jet, the biggest Bombardier has ever made, start to pour in.
So far, the program has been plagued by delays and cost over runs, with few major airlines signing on the dotted line. Even though Bombardier says it is talking to potential customers, there hasn’t been a single order for a year.
It has 243 firm orders, short of its goal of 300 orders by entry into service, which is slated for first half of next year.
The company says flight testing for the plane is almost 97 per cent complete, with certification “imminent,” and the assembly line in Mirabel busy working on production planes for first customer Swiss Air Lines.
Bombardier reported weak third-quarter earnings on Thursday, which includes its transportation division. Overall, it was a $4.9 billion (U.S.) loss, including the $3.2 billion charge for CSeries tooling and $1.2 billion charge for abandoning the Learjet 85 light aircraft program.
On an adjusted basis, net income was only $2 million in the quarter, on revenues of $4.1 billion, compared with a net income of $222 million for the same period a year ago.
During a conference call with analysts, CEO Alain Bellemare who took over in February from Pierre Beaudoin, grandson of the company’s founder, was bluntly asked: “How did things get so bad?”
“We had multiple programs running in parallel, and that was very challenging for an organization of our size,” Bellemare said, pointing to upgrading the Challenger jet, the Learjet 85, and development plans for the Global 7000/8000 business jets.
“The organization was overwhelmed by the number of programs. It is much different today,” he said, noting the Challenger project is completed and the Learjet85 has been cancelled.
Karl Moore, a McGill University business professor, said Quebec’s investment will be “enormously helpful,” and gives the company some breathing room.
The company is still seeking a buyer for a minority stake of its rail division Bombardier Transportation, which has been under fire in Toronto for long delays for its streetcars.
Moore added that other aerospace manufacturers like Airbus or Embraer have considerable government help, so it’s good that Bombardier is getting some help.
“If you want to play in the big leagues, it seems you need that,” he added.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Toronto Star,10-29-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/10/29/the-loss-is-mostly-tied-to-its-cseries-and-learjet-85-aircraft-programs-quebec-is-investing-1b-in-cseries.html,11-16-2015
0,Why Kathleen Wynne’s Hydro One sell-off is a sellout: Cohn,"Selling Hydro One is no ordinary sales job for Kathleen Wynne.
For a premier who places a premium on conversations, consultations and consensus, the proposed sale is a done deal. Wynne is pushing her privatization plan through the Legislature with minimal discussion, leaving key questions unanswered.
Amid the Hydro One hyperbole and hypocrisy — the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives keep reversing stances — here’s the good, the bad, the ugly, and the reality on electricity.
The Liberals are using their majority to rush the sale without providing the fine print on secret deals with the unions, or protection of the public interest.
A government-appointed panel on privatization, headed by ex-TD Bank chief executive Ed Clark, concluded last November that “Hydro One transmission should remain in public ownership as a core asset.” Last month, Clark’s panel executed a spectacular backflip, recommending the sale of 60 per cent of Hydro One because, when it came to “public ownership, we did not find the case compelling.”
Clark and Wynne insist they have learned lessons from the 1999 fire sale of Hwy. 407, when a PC government undervalued the asset, overpaid for transaction fees, and allowed the private owners to jack up tolls at will. The government promises to retain substantial control of Hydro One, keep transaction costs low, and act transparently.
Transparently? As my Star colleague Robert Benzie first reported last month, the government is quietly buying off the influential Power Workers’ Union with a sweetheart deal to win their support by giving its members shares in the new entity. The Liberals have refused to provide details on their secret undertakings to the powerful union, which has since dropped its opposition to any privatization.
Even with minority ownership of 40 per cent, the government stresses it would be the largest single shareholder of Hydro One, with other owners limited to 10 per cent stakes; key decisions will require a two-thirds vote by the board, giving the province an effective veto; and the government retains the right to fire the entire board (more of a nuclear option than actual control).
That’s fine as far as it goes. It just doesn’t go far enough.
Oh, and don’t be misled by opposition politicians and major unions that have lapsed into scaremongering about price gouging. By obsessing over price points, these critics are missing the larger point that electricity costs are strictly controlled under law — the Ontario Energy Board sets rates, not Hydro One, and it has a record of refusing increases.
The false spectre of high electricity rates generates more heat than light. The more vexing question is how private profit will prevail over public purpose.
As sole owner today, the government operates Hydro One in the public interest — and pockets roughly $800 million a year in profit. By contrast, the board of the partially privatized entity will have a fiduciary obligation to seek the highest profits for its new shareholders.
What difference does that make? In recent years, the Liberals have ordered Hydro One to install expensive smart meters in all Ontario homes, and asked the utility to speed up transmission links to wind turbines or solar panels.
Both were examples of elected governments imposing legitimate public policy obligations on Hydro One. Both decisions resulted in higher rates, which is why critics of privatization downplay the issue of public policy (or contradict themselves by pretending that it’s all about price).
Would a privatized Hydro One make future investments in transmission links to Hydro Quebec should it be in the public interest? The government insists it will find a way, it just won’t tell us precisely how.
In a speech last week, Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli talked about future legislation that would “enshrine the government’s right to prioritize critical transmission infrastructure.” Cabinet could “designate key transmission corridors” for First Nations, the Ring of Fire, or electricity trade with Quebec.
Details to come. Yet the privatization proceeds apace.
Wynne and Clark argue they need the money from privatization to invest in other public assets, notably transit and transportation infrastructure. Facing stiff public opposition to road tolls and other tax hikes, the government opted for an asset swap — with the result that Hydro One is being cannibalized to put flesh on the bare bones of transit infrastructure.
The early criticism of Wynne was that she couldn’t make tough decisions. Politics is the art of the possible — and choosing the least bad option. Now, she has gone against her own ideological instincts to privatize a public asset.
What are we giving up in control of transmission lines to gain new transit lines? The potential risk would be worth taking only if Wynne had exhausted all other options. But she hasn’t.
To govern is to choose, and privatizing is nothing if not a bold choice. Just not bold enough.
Rather than an asset swap that shortchanges the public interest, Wynne should have fought harder to bolster transit revenues to meet her cash shortfall. True, the PCs and NDP teamed up during the minority government years to oppose taxes and tolls, but she now has a majority.
She is using that majority to impose privatization of Hydro One on us rather than introduce new revenue measures, because our electricity utility offers the path of least resistance. While privatization is unpopular, taxation is even more unpopular.
Clark and Wynne argue that failing to make critical infrastructure investments in transit would be a missed economic opportunity. They are right about the opportunity costs, but wrong about the political opportunism that underlies their calculations.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Toronto Star,05-18-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/05/18/why-kathleen-wynnes-hydro-one-sell-off-is-a-sellout-cohn.html,11-16-2015
0,Craft brewers skeptical about The Beer Store’s changes,"Jason Fisher isn’t exactly hoisting one of his smoked coconut and bacteria-infused brews now that The Beer Store is attempting to roll out the welcome mat to him and his fellow craft brewers.
“We’re in different businesses. They mass produce their beer and keep it the same every time. We go looking for the craziest ingredients for flavour reasons, not for price reasons,” said the owner of Indie Ale House in the Junction.
Fisher and several other Ontario microbrewers said they were skeptical about the timing and motives behind Wednesday’s surprise announcement from The Beer store — the private retailer run by three giant foreign breweries — to open up ownership to the roughly 100 craft brewers across the province.
Under the changes, Ontario brewers that sell more than five million litres a year would pay $1,000, and smaller brewers $100, to become owners and get one Class E or Class F share. They are also being offered a total of three seats on the 15-member board of directors of the Beer Store. Molson and Labatt would each have five seats on the board and Sleeman two seats.
“I don’t like being super cynical but it’s hard not to be about this,” he said while renovating his funky beer emporium at Dundas and Keele, where he serves up his signature concoctions including Broken Hipster and Dead Spadina Monkey to thirsty locals.
The move comes on the heels of the Ontario government’s threats to dismantle the beer monopoly unless more money pours into the treasury and small brewers are given greater access to the market — and shelf space — largely dominated by mainstream brands Molson, Labatt and Sleeman.
“It’s obviously a tactic. Many of us in the industry were completely unaware of any of this until this morning,” said Gary McMullen, president of Muskoka Brewery Inc., which has a staff of 75.
He noted The Beer Store also notified craft brewers last minute about a conference call to get their input on the changes to be held Wednesday evening — a move he finds odd considering it’s taking place after rather than prior to the sudden announcement.
“We need change at The Beer Store to get equitable market share, but the concept of owning a share in it is kind of laughable for brewers my size,” said the co-founder of the 19-year-old Bracebridge-based business that annually produces about four million litres of brew including Mad Tom IPA and Hoptorial.
“A ‘preferred share’ wouldn’t get you more than a free ticket to the annual dinner,” he said with a chuckle.
The Beer Store denied it was trying to head off being charged a fee for its virtual monopoly on beer sales by offering to open up ownership.
“This is not related to that at all,” said Beer Store spokesman Jeff Newton.
The industry association Ontario Craft Brewers told The Canadian Press that the Beer Store announcement about opening ownership “came as a complete surprise” and does not address the key issue of improving access for consumers.
“Our goal continues to be fundamental change to Ontario’s beer distribution channels,” said Cam Heaps, chairman of Ontario Craft Brewers.
Steve Beauchesne, co-founder of family-run Beau’s All Natural Brewing Company, said he’s hopeful that the changes are a move in the right direction to get more exposure for craft brewers. And he’s pleased that The Beer Store is essentially admitting that the system has not been fair in the past in providing access to microbreweries, many of which are located in rural areas.
“We’re located in Vankleek Hill: population 1,800 people, 2,000 cows and one brewery. Listings in the five closest Beer Stores are not nearly as impactful as they would be in big cities,” Beauchesne said.
(He added though that in his case, his family already paid an $80,000 fee to get its organic Lug Tread 12-packs throughout the system.) Under the new rules, Beau’s would be able to list another product or size at a discounted listing fee.
Steve Abrams, co-founder of Toronto’s Mill Street Brewery, said he’s optimistic that the Beer Store is moving toward more transparency in how it operates.
“It’s an interesting development and we’ll see where it goes,” he said, noting the former Brewers’ Retail started historically as a co-operative of brewers working together.
“Our issue has always been more visibility for smaller brewers and I don’t know if that will change under this dynamic,” Abrams added.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Toronto Star,01-07-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/07/craft_brewers_skeptical_about_the_beer_stores_changes.html,11-16-2015
0,Layoffs begin at Tim Hortons HQ,"Just six weeks after the controversial Burger King takeover, Tim Hortons started handing out pink slips at its longtime corporate headquarters in Oakville and at regional offices across Canada.
Employees dashed to their cars and had no comment Tuesday as they left the head office of the 50-year-old doughnut and coffee behemoth, which is now being run under the Restaurant Brands International umbrella with Burger King after the blockbuster $12.5-billion takeover was completed in December.
Tim Hortons refused to say how many staff will be axed — or even provide a general number — despite repeated attempts when contacted as terminations got underway. But recent media speculation is that hundreds of employees of the 2,000 employed outside its restaurants are being let go, which was originally feared when the fast food giants announced the merger last August.
Besides its Oakville headquarters, Tim Hortons has regional offices in Guelph, Ont., Kingston, Ont. along with British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, plus one regional office in the U.S.
A spokesperson replied that because Tim Hortons is still notifying affected employees, “we’re not in the position to confirm the number of people impacted, either leaving the company or with new opportunities (in the merged company).”
David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said: “This is not surprising to anyone in the business community. Everyone knows layoffs were very likely to happen after the takeover.”
The non-profit think tank had warned there would be widespread layoffs and severe cost-cutting, especially with Burger King’s owner 3G Capital in charge, so as to pay back off debt it took on to make the deal happen. The Brazil-based investment firm has a track record of paring staff and slashing costs to the bone. That’s what happened after it took over Burger King, Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev prior to the Tim Hortons acquisition.
Macdonald said franchisees can expect less support from the shrinking head office, along with cutbacks in advertising and other areas.
“We have had to make some difficult but necessary decisions today as we reorganize our company to position ourselves for the significant growth and opportunities ahead of us,” said Alexandra Cygal, Tim Hortons’ vice-president, corporate affairs, in an email. “We are confident the new organization will be faster, more efficient and better positioned for continued success.”
Industry Canada approved the deal with specific requirements: Burger King must “maintain significant employment levels” at the Oakville headquarters and must maintain 100-per-cent staffing levels at franchises across the country.
Earlier this month, two longtime Tims executives abruptly resigned from their new roles in the merged company.
“This comprehensive process has created tremendous opportunities for some of our employees in new roles and promotions,” Cygal said in her email.
“We greatly appreciate the service and contributions of all of our employees and are treating departing employees with the utmost respect, while providing generous and enhanced severance packages, continuing health benefits and outplacement services.”
She confirmed the headquarters will remain in Oakville as promised, “and our commitment to long-standing brand values and traditions, including our significant community involvement, will continue.”
The merger — which created the world’s third-largest restaurant company, with 18,000 stores and $23 billion in sales — was originally pitched by executives as the best way to expand Tim Hortons internationally and make the beloved Canadian brand truly global.
Meanwhile Tuesday, the Star’s Tara Deschamps reports company officials were hanging around the headquarters lobby talking on smartphones and nervously glancing at the reporters gathered outside. When approached by media, the company’s receptionists simply said, “No comment.”
“It’s too bad,” said Robert Carter, executive director of food services at the NPD Group, a market research firm. “They had a good team in place at Tim Hortons that built it into a solid, very successful brand.”
However, Carter noted layoffs and cost-cutting are the order of the day in the struggling fast-food industry, which is fighting to maintain market share amid slow growth and waning consumer interest.
New Democrat MP Peggy Nash, the party’s industry critic, said: “Our hearts go out to the employees at Tim Hortons, who now join the workers at Target, Zellers, Bombardier, Mexx, Jacobs, Bowring, Smartset and Sony in being let down by this government (to protect jobs).”",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Toronto Star,01-27-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/27/layoffs-begin-at-tim-hortons-hq.html,11-16-2015
0,Americans Use More Online Social Networks,"Teenagers may be spending more time on messaging services like Snapchat, but American adults are still increasing their use of social networks, according to a new survey released Friday by the Pew Research Center.

The Pew survey, conducted in September, found that 52 percent of Internet users regularly logged on to at least two social networks, up from 42 percent in Pew’s August 2013 survey.

The percentage of adults using Facebook, the most general social network, stayed about the same, at 71 percent of the online population. But Pew found significant increases in the number of people using Instagram, a photo service owned by Facebook; Pinterest, a visually oriented service for “pinning” favorite items; LinkedIn, a business networking service; and Twitter, a microblogging service oriented toward real-time news and information.

Facebook users were the most dedicated, with 70 percent logging in at least once a day. Nearly half of Instagram users visit the site daily.

Twitter, which has reported slow user growth in recent quarters, saw fewer visits from its American users, according to the Pew study. Only 36 percent of them visit the site daily, the researchers found, compared with 46 percent in the 2013 survey.

In a statement after the survey data was released, Twitter disputed the findings, saying, “Pew’s data is so wrong as to be laughable. As we said at our Analyst Day in November, 48 percent of our monthly active users in our top 20 markets use the service daily, and the U.S. is our top market,” said Rachel Millner, a Twitter spokeswoman.

LinkedIn users also said they visited the site less frequently, although a dedicated core of 13 percent said they went at least once a day.

The Pew research surveyed 2,003 adults, including 1,597 Internet users, by cellphone and land line. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

What the numbers don’t reveal was the time people spent on each service. Because most social networks generate revenue from advertising, more time on the service means a greater opportunity for visitors to see ads.

But the researchers did learn that for the median Facebook user, two-thirds of his or her friends weren’t “actual” friends at all. And less than half of adult Facebook users have friended their parents or children on the service.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,New York Times,01-09-2015,http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/americans-use-more-online-social-networks/,11-18-2015
0,In-Car Communication Systems Called a Growing Frustration,"As communications systems proliferate in cars, they are becoming the biggest source of annoyance for owners, according to a study by the market research firm J. D. Power.

From buggy Bluetooth systems to voice recognition systems that do not recognize voices, the problems with in-car computer systems have surpassed excessive wind noise as the most-cited issue.

And the problems are increasing, Renee Stephens, vice president for United States automotive at J. D. Power, said in a telephone interview. “Technology in the vehicles just didn’t keep up with all the technology that’s in the phones,” she said.

The vehicle dependability study, now in its 26th year, measures problems experienced by the original owners of three-year-old vehicles, in this case 2012 models.

At three years, many consumers are thinking of replacing their vehicles, and many prospective buyers are considering cars just coming off a lease. Durability is cited as the most important reason for choosing a brand or a model, according to J. D. Power. This year’s study included 228 models and 31 brand rankings.

Of owners who had problems with their Bluetooth systems, 55 percent said their vehicle would not recognize their phone and 31 percent said the phone would not automatically connect when they entered the vehicle.

The No. 2 problem was voice recognition systems that misinterpreted commands. Effective voice recognition is seen as a critical function in cars if consumers are to be discouraged from distracted driving. Google and Apple are poised to enter the market widely, with new dashboard computer systems that will allow consumers to use their smartphones.

The study also showed that technology was playing an increasingly important role in buying decisions. Fifteen percent of new-car buyers said they avoided a model because it lacked certain technological features, up from 4 percent in last year’s study.

The study covered 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle systems like exterior, seats, steering, suspension, braking and engine and transmission. J. D. Power then ranked brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.

Lexus was the most reliable brand for the fourth consecutive year. Although Lexus lost that top ranking from 2009 to 2011, it had been on top of the survey for 14 years before that.

In addition to Lexus coming in on top, the 2012 Lexus ES was the most dependable vehicle in the industry, with 79 problems per 100 vehicles.

Toyota Motor Sales, with its Lexus, Toyota and Scion brands, and General Motors, with its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands, did well. All their brands ranked in the top 10 and above the industry average.

The industry’s average for dependability in this year’s study was 147 problems per 100 vehicles, which was about 1.5 problems per vehicle.

But it is impossible to say whether dependability has improved or declined from last year because the study was substantially redesigned this year.

The industry average “is in line with what we expected the increase to be with a redesign like this,” Ms. Stephens said. “It wasn’t a lot higher, and it wasn’t a lot lower.”

Last year’s study found that for the first time since 1998, vehicle dependability declined. a drop that was characterized as “very significant.”

After Lexus (with 89 problems per 100), brands that rounded out the top 10 were Buick (110), Toyota (111), Cadillac (114), Honda and Porsche (in a tie for fifth with 116), Lincoln (118), Mercedes-Benz (119), Scion (121) and Chevrolet and GMC (in a tie for 10th with 123).

In the bottom five were Dodge (192), Mini Cooper (193) and Jeep (197). But the brands with far and away the most problems were Land Rover (258) in 30th place and Fiat (273) at the bottom in 31st.

Scion was the most-improved brand, up 13 spots this year to ninth place. That is because “every single one of its vehicles was at the top of its segment, just a phenomenal performance,” Ms. Stephens said.

Ford fell eight places to 25th, from 17th last year, mainly because of the transmission problems in the Ford Focus, Ms. Stephens said. And Ford isn’t the only one. Nearly 30 percent of reported powertrain problems in the study were a result of automatic transmission hesitation and rough shifting.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,New York Times,02-25-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/automobiles/in-car-communication-systems-are-a-growing-frustration-jd-power-study-finds.html,11-18-2015
0,It’s ‘Back to the Future’ Day. How Does the Present Stack Up?,"On Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, at 4:29 p.m., our today will finally catch up to the tomorrow depicted in “Back to the Future, Part II.” In that 1989 film, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) appear with a flash in their DeLorean time machine from 30 years in the past. Suddenly, they find themselves in the same town, Hill Valley, but surrounded by impossible technology and outlandish social mores. It’s a place where cars can fly, hoverboards are the norm and, most incredibly, the Chicago Cubs have won the World Series.

This collision of science fiction with present-day fact will be marked by a deluge of merchandise, including a new Blu-ray and DVD release packaging the first “Back to the Future” with its two sequels, and the animated series. There will also be multiple book retrospectives and a documentary, “Back in Time.”

One product you will not see however, is the hoverboard. Despite recent advances, Kickstarter prototypes and oddly popular “hover boards” that have wheels, the movie version remains stubbornly out of reach.

But still, perhaps this strange world is not so far-fetched after all.

With the benefit of hindsight — and a closer look — “Back to the Future, Part II” proves surprisingly prescient. Coexisting with inventions and trends that may never come to fruition are those that have now arrived, including the use of drones, eyeglasses as wearable tech, video conferencing, and a focus on urban renewal and green space.

Bob Gale, who wrote and produced the film with the director Robert Zemeckis, discussed their original vision in a telephone interview and explained, “Bob and I knew we were never going to be accurately predict the future.”

At least when it comes to flying cars, Mr. Gale does not mind being wrong. “People have enough trouble driving in two dimensions,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a good idea to give them the Z axis.”

Unshackled by the need to become all-knowing futurists, they instead kept their vision hopeful, imagining a 2015 that audiences would want to visit, and they assigned their crew to make that concept a reality.

The visual effects art director John Bell designed many of the fantastical elements. “I just started taking stabs at anything from the vehicles to the hoverboards to the costumes and town square, where Marty lived,” Mr. Bell said. That included passing visuals like a drone dog walker.

“We thought that was kind of a joke, but that’s going to happen,” Mr. Gale said. Another drone appears as a remote photographer for USA Today.

The art team, which was overseen by the production designer Rick Carter, took part in brainstorming sessions to add as many blink-and-you’ll-miss-them background details as possible. “We were all just driving to the unknown,” the costume designer Joanna Johnston said. “So everyone was going: ‘What about this? What about this? But what about this?’ ”

For the town square, it was decided that the future Hill Valley would be more forward-thinking in its urban planning. Mr. Gale, Mr. Zemeckis and the production team all believed that community space would be emphasized and old architecture would be maintained, which mirrors the trends in urban design that gave birth to destinations like the High Line in New York. In 1985, the site in front of the Hill Valley clock tower is a parking lot; in 2015, it’s a luscious green park with a lake.

“That town square could exist now,” Mr. Carter said. “We’d build upon what was and either turn it, or embrace it.”

The residents of Hill Valley also seem to make some strange fashion choices. Mr. Bell and Ms. Johnston exaggerated the designs so that almost everything was asymmetrical and overly colorful. But underlying their choices was another accurate directive from Mr. Zemeckis. “I was told that people were going to be wearing their athletic clothes all day, which they didn’t then,” Ms. Johnston said. “And now they do all the time.”

In the McFly household, gadgets permeate every facet of home life. Mr. Carter pointed out that while technology would continually advance, one thing would remain the same: “If it doesn’t work, it’s just frustrating,” he said. So the television screen is on the fritz. A retractable garden struggles to follow voice commands. “Young Marty is exasperated when it doesn’t function perfectly,” Mr. Carter said.

Some of the gadgets are on the edge of tomorrow, like the Google Glass-like spectacles designed by Doug Chiang. They’re used by Marty’s son (played by Mr. Fox) to watch television and his daughter (also played by Mr. Fox) to check on an incoming phone call.

Other on-screen developments, like the fax machine, have seemed archaic for years now. “We missed the smartphone completely,” Mr. Gale said. (Though some of the devices in the film work via voice recognition, à la Siri.)

But, when viewed in 2015, it’s that incoming phone call that is, perhaps, the most eye-opening moment. Marty talks to his co-worker Needles (Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) via a large screen that is essentially an incredible combination of Skype and Facebook. As Needles antagonizes Marty, a running list of personal profile data appears on the bottom of the screen — from occupation, age, date of birth and address to favorite alcoholic beverages and hobbies. Needles, it turns out, is an “avid basketball fan.” Mr. Gale said this idea came from the assumption that computers would one day contain the information that in the 1980s could be found in a Rolodex.

Marty wonders aloud if their boss is monitoring the call. Sure enough, in a twist that might surprise even Edward J. Snowden and the National Security Agency, Marty’s boss immediately calls him and admits that he was tapped into the conversation the whole time. And this is after the screen reads, “Thank you for using AT&T.”

What of the film’s boldest prediction of all — that the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series this year? Amazingly enough, the Cubs made the playoffs this year, impressing even Mr. Gale, a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan. “I will absolutely be rooting for them.”",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,New York Times,10-16-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/movies/2015-when-the-future-was-bright-in-back-to-the-future.html,11-18-2015
0,Cybersecurity Firm Says Chinese Hackers Keep Attacking U.S. Companies,"HONG KONG — It was heralded as the first concrete step taken by the United States and China on the thorny issue of online espionage.

With President Xi Jinping of China beside him at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden last month, President Obama said the two had come to an agreement that China and the United States would refrain from attacks aimed at pilfering company intellectual property or trade secrets for commercial advantage.

Less than a day after that announcement and after Mr. Xi had met in Seattle with the executives of leading American technology companies, a hacking group accused of having links to the Chinese government attacked one such company, looking for trade secrets.

In a blog post on Monday, the security services provider CrowdStrike, based in Irvine, Calif., said that it had tracked a number of attacks on American tech and pharmaceutical companies leading up to and after Mr. Xi’s visit to the United States last month. (Mr. Xi has been logging airtime, making his first state visit to Britain this week.)

“We detected and stopped the actors, so no exfiltration of customer data actually took place,” according to the post, written by the CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer, Dmitri Alperovitch.

But more problematic, he wrote in the post, was that the attacks had continued in the three weeks since Washington and Beijing signed the security agreement.

The news of further hacking attempts is likely to put new pressure on the countries’ agreement to limit attacks on private companies. A number of analysts had already expressed skepticism that the accord would lead to concrete changes in a Chinese policy they say has sought for years to plunder secrets from companies in the United States.

In announcing the agreement, Mr. Obama said the United States would be “watching carefully” to see if the accord led to progress, and he did not rule out economic sanctions against Chinese companies if the attacks continued.

Of those attacked, “seven of the companies are firms in the technology or pharmaceuticals sectors, where the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets,” Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the blog post.

“The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures,” he added.

According to the CrowdStrike blog post, several of the recent attacks were the responsibility of a group it calls Deep Panda, which the company said it had tracked for many years. Deep Panda often goes after strategic national security targets, but it has also hacked companies in an array of industries, including in agriculture, finance, chemicals and technology.

Mr. Alperovitch did not write that the continued hackings were evidence that the deal had failed, though he called for the Obama administration to explain what it expected the agreement to accomplish.

“The fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected,” Mr. Alperovitch wrote. “But we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a time frame for implementation, or, instead, expected it to be immediate.”

In one of the first major markers of Chinese action against the attacks, the country arrested a number of hackers who were said to have stolen secrets of United States companies before Mr. Xi’s American visit, according to The Washington Post.

Even so, further attacks were likely to be viewed as a setback. Though China is home to a hard-to-control and diffuse network of state-affiliated hackers, it would probably be fairly simple for Beijing to control a central group like Deep Panda.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,New York Times,10-19-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/technology/cybersecurity-firm-says-chinese-hackers-keep-attacking-us-companies.html,11-18-2015
0,"With the TV Business in Upheaval, Targeted Ads Offer Hope","Dollars follow eyeballs. This bedrock principle of media advertising is working against the television industry today, as new viewing patterns challenge old ways of doing business.

The most recent evidence surfaced in August, when one major media company after another reported weaker television advertising revenue. The shares of the companies, including Disney, 21st Century Fox, Viacom and CBS, suffered as Wall Street saw a warning sign that Madison Avenue has recognized for some time.

“The traditional TV model is breaking apart,” said Laura Desmond, chief executive of Starcom MediaVest, one of the world’s largest ad-buying companies. “It’s both a crisis and a huge opportunity.”

The peril and promise are byproducts of television’s truly becoming a digital medium. Internet services like Netflix and YouTube deliver video programming to screens large and small, in living rooms and on smartphones — and it is sent “over the top,” in industry jargon, via the Internet, sidestepping the TV industry’s accustomed control point, the set-top box. In addition, digital recording services, now offered by cable and satellite TV operators, allow programs to be recorded for later viewing.

The TV market is fracturing and becoming less predictable, undermining the main appeal of traditional TV to advertisers: its ability to deliver mass-market audiences.

Yet as TV embraces digital technology, it opens the door to targeting television ads as never before, much as is done with advertising on the web today.

That helps explain the surge in digital video advertising on Google’s YouTube, Facebook and streaming services like Hulu, where the rules of Internet targeting apply. Those online video ads are only a tenth of the television ad market of $70 billion a year, but they are projected to grow 21 percent a year, according to Forrester Research. By contrast, advertising on cable and broadcast television is expected to inch ahead at 1 percent annually.

Until recently, TV audience information used by advertisers has come mainly from samples of viewers and surveys, conducted by Nielsen and other market research companies. The monitoring made possible by digital technology can be far more detailed — down to the household level — not only covering what is being watched but, when combined with other data sources, also predicting behavior and buying habits. “The Internet was an example of what can be done, but now it is going to TV as well,” said Shereta Williams, president of Videa, an advertising technology start-up owned by the Cox Media Group.

The technology for digital TV is still in its early stages. The TV industry wants to be able to target ads to households and individuals, as on the web, but without losing control of its distribution network and business.

The set-top box has long been TV’s technical gateway, and that technology is receiving a digital upgrade to give set-top boxes Internet-style targeting capabilities. Today, including satellite TV and cable providers, nearly 40 million set-top boxes are “household addressable,” representing about a third of American households.

For advertisers, this should mean more productive ads and the ability to scientifically test their effectiveness. Last year, Starcom MediaVest did an addressable TV ad campaign for Honda’s Acura TLX luxury sedan. The firm combined anonymized sales data and other data to choose 1.7 million households to show Acura ads. Those households’ rate of buying the cars was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar control group who were not shown the ads.

With advanced software and data-mining technology, the potential for tailoring ads can be quite refined. So, for example, two households in New York, living in next-door apartments, could watch, say, “The Good Wife,” and see different ads. In one apartment, a couple who contribute to environmental causes and have no children could be shown an ad for a compact car. In the other apartment, a couple with two children and a weekend home might be shown an ad for a sport utility vehicle.

The future of TV advertising may be more like web advertising, but it will not be a rerun, analysts and industry executives insist. On the web, some newspaper and magazine publishers have built sizable digital ad businesses. But it has proved to be a winner-take-most marketplace, with the biggest winners being the Internet ad giants Google and Facebook.

“TV will take on some of the characteristics of Internet advertising in terms of targeting and relying on data to predict who is behind the screen,” said James Nail, an analyst at Forrester Research. “But video sellers have greater power to dictate how the new technology rolls out.”

On traditional television, major consumer product and brand advertisers want their ads to be shown alongside high-quality video programming, mainly the sitcoms and dramas the medium is known for, say the analysts and executives. It is the kind of video environment, they say, that delivers the sight, sound and emotion that drive decision-making.

“Premium content is scarce, and scarcity creates a huge difference between TV and the Internet,” said Scott Ferber, chief executive of Videology, an ad tech start-up.

The big media companies have used that scarcity to deflect competition in the past. In 2012, Google shut down its Google TV Ads unit after it made little headway in trying to adapt its Internet marketplace model to selling television ads. The TV networks and local stations, analysts say, refused to put the ad inventory they hold for marketers on the Google marketplace.

Today, Google is pursuing a vision of Internet-style ad delivery — called programmatic TV — but with a modified approach, portraying itself as a tools maker to assist content providers and marketers.

Google’s role, said Rany Ng, director of product management for video ads, is to “bring data-driven buying and automation to how television and video advertising is bought.”

In recent years, video ad tech start-ups have proliferated, typically specializing in working with the big media companies or ad buyers. They provide software expertise and consulting services and often match buyers and sellers.

“This is so central to the creators’ and marketers’ strategy. They are going to want to be in greater control over time,” said Bill Day, chief executive of Tremor Video, an ad technology start-up.

For finely tailored ads, data is crucial. So data brokers and data-analysis companies, including Acxiom, Experian and Dunnhumby, are also suppliers to the emerging industry of digital TV.

Acxiom, for example, has demographic, shopping and lifestyle information on every American household. Rick Erwin, its general manager of audience solutions, views digital TV as another market for its targeting services, which are used in direct mail, telemarketing, email and online ads.

“Whenever a medium becomes addressable at the household level, we’re the data fuel,” he said.

For advertisers, the long-term goal is to be able to reach ideal customers for their products, on any screen. The potential, said Mr. Nail of Forrester, is for a TV viewing experience less cluttered with irrelevant ads and “dramatically improved results for TV advertisers.”

But predicting the winners in the high-stakes, high-tech migration to digital TV, analysts and executives agree, is uncertain. Ms. Desmond of Starcom MediaVest, for example, expects a wrenching consolidation in the media business over the next three years or so. The only three sure survivors, she said, are Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast NBCUniversal. Smaller players will most likely be bought up.The acquirers, Ms. Desmond said, may well include the Internet powerhouses, like Google and Facebook.

Even those who insist the TV market is unique have their qualms. “It should be different,” Mr. Ferber of Videology said, “but these digital companies are so huge and so powerful, they are going to be hard to resist.”",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,New York Times,09-29-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/media/with-the-tv-business-in-upheaval-targeted-ads-offer-hope.html,11-18-2015
0,What's the reality behind Virtual Reality?,"Sometime in the next few years, you will likely have the opportunity to strap on a virtual reality headset and check out a technology that promises to transport the user to another world.
Many companies are planning on launching headsets in the coming year and though early adopters may rush to strap one on, there are still a number of issues that VR has to solve before it can really go mainstream.
“I’m the most optimistic guy about VR out there. I have crazy visions of what we’ll be doing in the future. But it’s not going to reach hundreds of millions of people in the next three years,"" Palmer Luckey told Recode.
Luckey is the co-founder of Oculus VR, the Facebook-owned company that is largely responsible for kicking off the current wave of interest in VR. Just before E3 last week, Oculus held its own press event where it showed off the commercial version of its VR device, the Rift, and unveiled new hand-held controllers that help people interact in virtual space.
As with any new technology, cost of VR gear is likely to be high initially. While Oculus didn't announce a price, it did release the PC specifications needed to run its headset, estimating that the cost of a computer and a Rift headset might be in the $1,500 range. Sony said its Project Morpheus headset will costs several hundred dollars, and obviously will require a PS4 to work with, which retails for $449 in Canada.
Part of the issue that remains is that extended periods with a poorly calibrated VR set can cause nausea. The immersive nature of VR tricks the brain into seeing a world that doesn’t match what all the user’s senses are registering. That disconnect is what causes nausea.

Hard-core gaming is clearly how VR will make its first real inroads with consumers. But even there, many are taking a wait-and-see approach. Microsoft’s VR Hololens was one of the buzziest E3 onstage demonstrations, but when reviewers actually got to try it out, many were disappointed. It’s a wrap around headset, but the actual field-of-view that the device provides is quite small, which many complained ruined the immersive feel of device — and immersive feel is what VR is supposed to be all about.
The other big issue is that virtual reality needs to settle before it goes mainstream is settling on a single format. Beyond the video game companies, phone companies such as Samsung and HTC are also creating headsets, meaning choice for consumers, but a potential stumbling block for content creators.
""We haven't seen the commercial release of the hardware. We haven't seen commercial release of any software,” told BloombergStrauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two, makers of Grand Theft Auto told Bloomberg. ""We're intrigued. We're doing a lot of homework. We haven't made any announcements yet. I think it remains to be seen what that format is.""
While gaming companies are experimenting with different experience and extended tech demos, virtual reality will require a new way of game making and figuring out what might work.
Nintendo has yet to announce a VR headset, and one of the company's executives pointed to the fact that it is an isolating experience as being a drawback.
""We have knowledge of the technical space, and we've been experimenting with this for a long, long time,"" said Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime in a Polygon interview. ""What we believe is that, in order for this technology to move forward, you need to make it fun and you need to make it social.”
Most people will likely get their first taste of VR in the non-gaming world — several industries are using the technology to give potential clients a taste of projects that have not yet been built.
At this year's Cannes Lions advertising industry market, The Line, a luxury brand used a VR demo to transport people into its Manhattan store, The Apartment. Marriott Hotels has trotted out a booth rigged (dubbed the “teleporter”) with a VR headset to take people on virtual tours around the world. At this month’s Paris Air Show, Boeing used Google’s Cardboard VR headsets to give people a virtual tour of their new planes.
Closer to home, Fort York is working on a virtual tourism project, designed to give people a taste of the site’s historic past.
Whatever the ultimate use of VR, one thing’s clear already: the one stumbling block that may not have an easy solution how to make anyone wearing one of those headsets look cool.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Toronto Star,06-24-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/06/24/whats-the-reality-behind-virtual-reality.html,11-18-2015
0,"Ontario bans flavoured tobacco, forces calorie count on fast-food menus","Ontario just got healthier.
MPPs from all three parties voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to pass the Making Healthier Choices Act, banning flavoured tobacco, limiting e-cigarettes, and forcing fast-food chains to put calorie counts on their menus.
Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla said the legislation, which passed by a vote of 100-1, will “lower smoking rates and fight obesity.”
But amid concerns over the curbs on e-cigarettes, which some health activists believe are helpful in smoking cessation efforts, Damerla stressed the government is not outlawing “vaping.”
“We’re not banning electronic cigarettes, we’re simply regulating them,” she said, noting the sale of e-cigarettes to those 19 and under will be prohibited.
At the same time, it will be illegal to use e-cigarettes in non-smoking areas and to promote or display them for sale.
But Damerla said she’s “leaving the door open” to them as a smoke-cessation product like nicotine patches if further research proves they are effective.
“We can’t have it promoted as a cool product,” she said, emphasizing the government doesn’t want teens starting to vape.
All flavoured tobacco products will be forbidden with menthol being given a two-year reprieve.
NDP MPP France Gelinas (Nickel Belt), who has pushed the moves for seven years, said the new law “will save lives” in Ontario.
But Progressive Conservative MPP Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington), the lone dissenter, expressed concern that the vaping measures might actually have the opposite effect.
“Countless studies by the world’s top anti-smoking researchers have shown time and time again that vaporizers are proving to be the most effective smoking cessation device ever created,” said Hillier, who credits the e-cigarette with helping him go from two packs of cigarettes a day to less than one.
“I’ve tried everything … gum, patches and every other device known to man and they have not been as effective,” he said.
Tuesday’s legislation will also require restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores selling prepared food at 20 or more locations in Ontario to post the calories for all food and beverages, including alcohol on menus.
Mark Holland, Ontario executive director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation, said that will “empower people” to make more informed choices when ordering their meals.
“We are making progress to help Ontarians live healthy lives free of heart disease and stroke,” he said.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Toronto Star,05-26-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/05/26/ontario-mpps-ban-flavoured-tobacco-force-calorie-count-on-fast-food-menus.html,11-18-2015
0,Toyota spends $1 billion to research cars that drive themselves,"TOKYO — Toyota Motor Corp. is spending $1 billion to form a research institute focused on the artificial intelligence and robotics technology it needs to make cars that can overcome driver errors and reduce traffic fatalities.
Toyota Research Institute Inc. will pitch in on the safety systems the automaker is developing to curtail car accidents that kill 1.25 million people per year worldwide. The company will also work toward making it easier for elderly drivers to hang onto their keys in aging countries including Japan and the U.S., Toyota’s biggest markets.
Getting an edge in this research would set Toyota apart from its Japanese peers, which have been pursuing fully autonomous cars under more conservative time frames than Google Inc. or Tesla Motors Inc. With Toyota President and racing enthusiast Akio Toyoda by his side, the newly-formed R&D unit’s chief executive said competing to put autonomous cars on the road will be an endurance contest, rather than a sprint.
“It’s possible at the beginning of a car race that you may not be in the best position,” said Gill Pratt, CEO of the institute and Toyota’s executive technical adviser. “It may be that other drivers are saying a whole lot about what their position is, and everyone may expect that a particular car will win. But of course, if the race is very long, who knows who will win? We’re going to work extremely hard.”
Toyota Research Institute will start operations in January, and the Japanese carmaker’s five-year initial investment will go toward setting up locations near Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pratt, 54, will oversee about 200 employees.
The son of an assembly line worker who installed tires on Ford models in Edison, New Jersey, Pratt joined Toyota after having serving as the U.S. military’s top robotics engineer. The former program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics efforts joined Toyota in September.
Toyota last month offered reporters test drives in a “highway teammate” concept car, a modified Lexus GS sedan that can enter public expressways, switch lanes and steer to the off ramp, all while picking spots to speed up or slow down based on the surrounding traffic. The company said it aims to introduce similar cars with automated highway driving by around 2020.
Google has put in about 2 million kilometres with its test vehicles using software to drive themselves, and has estimated it could have a fully autonomous car ready for public roads by about 2020. Tesla has beamed Autopilot features into about 40,000 of its Model S sedans that enable the cars to self-steer on the highway.
The 2020 time frame has particular resonance for Japanese carmakers, as the companies want to showcase their progress toward self-driving in conjunction with Tokyo hosting the Olympics the same year.
“I used to say in the past that in a 24-hour race, if the automated vehicle beats our human-driven vehicles, I will embrace automated driving,” said Toyoda, 59, adding that his views have changed. “One hundred years ago, horses were replaced by automobiles because people found automobiles to be more fun than horses. One hundred years from now, I would like vehicles to remain loved by people.”",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Toronto Star,11-06-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/11/06/toyota-spends-1-billion-to-research-cars-that-drive-themselves.html,11-18-2015
0,What’s all the Hubub?,"Facebook is running a new batch of TV commercials, but that’s one front where Hubub has the social media giant beat. The Toronto-based start-up had a Super Bowl commercial in Canada that is still airing, introducing people to its new social platform.
So what the heck is a Hubub? With the tag line, “Your Interest Internet,” it is a topic-based site that wants to become a place where users discuss things online. People sign on and create or follow Hububs for all kinds of interests, from Sports Brawls to Human Rights in Korea. What makes this site different is beyond comments, there’s a rich media experience: users can post images, blogs, articles and polls, and pose questions for debate.
“It is bit like Facebook’s newsfeed without all the other crap around,” says Robert Oh, Hubub’s product lead.
Or another take: “It’s sort of like a chat room on steroids, but much more” says founder Peter Corsell.
That TV commercial came partly thanks to a $5 million equity stake from Bell Media, which also has marketing and monetization rights to Hubub in Canada and hopes that its investment will grow exponentially if the 46-person company becomes the next big online thing.
The site aims to increase user engagement, and there may be an opportunity, as online commenting and chat rooms haven’t evolved much, even though they are clearly used. The problem: they’re not areas where people have figured out how to make money. For most media companies, commenting is a troublesome must have.
That’s where Hubub sees an opportunity. While the company has created it’s own site housing topic pages, Hububs can also be placed on other sites. Thanks to Bell, users will start seeing more of these, starting on Monday with TSN’s NHL trade deadline coverage. This is a high-traffic date for the network’s TradeCentre; instead of the regular comments section at the bottom of the page, users will find a Hubub.
“Because we have a large marketing machine — a megaphone, we like to call it — we can invest in smaller guys, and help them along,” says Jeff Hersh, director of strategy and business development at Bell Media. Hubub “is a very interesting opportunity, as it plays in the social and search areas.
“Do we know it’s going to be a sure success? No, but all the big online players are international, so you do have start at an earlier stage in Canada if you want to get in on these opportunities.”
Something like Hubub needs highly engaged users to exist; in particular, it needs people who want to curate content into Hububs, as well as those who want to read them.
Chantal Bechervaise saw a commercial and decided to check it out. Already heavily involved in social media, she created the Everything to do with Leadership, Human Resources and Social Media Hubub. She’s been using it for about six weeks.
“I use it as an extension of my brand. I use social media for branding and thought leadership, and I blog, so I found it an opportunity to get more readers,” she says. “What I like about it, unlike Facebook or Twitter, is when you post something, it lasts longer. When you create a page, it is a bit like Pinterest. When you pin something, it stays there.”
With 17,000 views on Hubub, Becervaise says she likes how it has driven traffic to her blog.
Hubub is still working on its technology, building up topic pages and finding ways to work with Bell properties. But the path to monetization comes from eventually providing advertising opportunities. The company wants to work with brands to create content they would share on pages. Similar to Buzzfeed, it’s a native advertising play — ads that look like content — that curators can decide to post.
For example, if a user created a home renovation Hubub that garnered a large following, Hubub could convince a hardware store to make a how-to video, which it would offer to the Hubub owner to post.
Other users can create rival Hububs in the same topic area, effectively competing for readers and monetization opportunities. It is an idea similar to Foursquare, where users can usurp others by checking in at certain places more often.
That requires a high level of sophistication from both brands and users, not to mention content good enough to pull people away from more established discussion zones, such as Reddit.
“Brands are already realizing they have to get better as creating that kind of content,” says Corsell. “The great part of this is that content will be in a place people are looking for it.”
Right now, Hubub is in the user acquisition phase, and there is no mention of longer-term plans for monetization on the site. Corsell and his team admit a need for a way to explain their longer-term plans. For a start, though, the company needs users to get the conversation going.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Toronto Star,03-01-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/03/01/whats-all-the-hubub.html,11-18-2015
0,A peek inside Apple’s R&D wish list. TV reimagined?,"CUPERTINO, CALIF. — A computer mouse that doubles as a scanner. A coating that keeps gadgets safe and dry even in the event of a spill. And a smartphone that rotates like a cat mid-air to avoid landing on its pretty glass face.
You may not see them on shelves anytime soon, but they are among the inventions that Apple protected in 2014 as it took in a bumper crop of new patents.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple 2,003 utility patents, which recognize new and useful processes and machines. That’s a 13 per cent increase over 2013 and more than triple the company’s 2010 haul, according to IFI Claims, a patent analysis firm.
The steady increase in patents comes as Apple is doubling down on research and development, pouring $6 billion into its labs in fiscal year 2014, which ended in September. The investments suggest the company is laying the groundwork to find its next lucrative products, recognizing that it can’t coast if it wants to stay in investors’ good graces, Gartner analyst Van Baker said.
“When you’re that big, and you want to continue to grow at a rate that the market is going to reward, you have to expand your business,” he said.
Although companies commonly patent ideas they do not ultimately use, the evolving makeup of Apple’s portfolio points to spaces the company may be mining for future growth. Among other areas, the company has amassed more intellectual property related to television, a household staple ripe for reinvention, and cybersecurity, one of the tech industry’s greatest headaches after a series of worrisome hacks.
The tech titan’s burgeoning patent portfolio mirrors a shift underway in Silicon Valley and across the globe as companies worldwide are racing to protect nearly everything their engineers come up with, said Larry Cady, vice president of product marketing at IFI Claims.
Grants climbed more than 8 per cent to cross the 300,000 threshold for the first time in 2014, with many companies besting their records.
Apple ranked 11th on IFI’s list of top patent recipients and, in the Bay Area of California, second only to Google, which took eighth place with 2,566 patents in 2014, up nearly 39 per cent from the previous year.
IBM brought home the most patents, as it has for 22 years running, and valley stalwarts such as Hewlett-Packard and Cisco also showed solid gains, upping their tallies by 16 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.
A patent gives a company the right to use an invention exclusively for a limited period of time. But the trade-off is that the firm must offer up a glimpse of what it is working on, which is notoriously hard to come by at Apple headquarters.
A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the company’s patents.
According to data supplied by IFI, the types of technology for which Apple won the most patents in 2014 were computer graphics, mobile communications and computer software. That suggests the company is continuing to focus on its strengths, such as the powerhouse iPhone, which drives more than half its sales.
But the company also has steadily earned more patents related to television, bringing home 73 in 2014, up from 28 in 2012 and a mere eight in 2011, according to IFI. That may be good news for Apple fans and investors who have long been waiting for the company to reimagine the television set.
One patent granted in December describes technology that would stream content simultaneously on a fixed device such as an Apple TV and a portable gadget such as a smartphone, letting users leave their living rooms to grab snacks without missing a moment of their favourite shows. Another patent describes a new-age wand that users would wave to pick shows, rather than clicking old-fashioned remotes.
The company’s patent portfolio also suggests a growing interest in security, with grants related to information security climbing 44 per cent to 39 patents and grants related to cryptography climbing 25 per cent to 15 patents, according to IFI. The company must keep security top of mind as it designs its gadgets, Baker noted.
“It’s an important consideration in mobile devices because we’re living in a world where there are more and more threats in terms of malware, cyberespionage, identity theft and hacks,” he said.
When it comes to Apple, the faintest possibility of a new device is enough to cause investors to sit up and take notice. Patently Apple, a blog that tracks patent filings from Apple, recently spotted that the company had earned a patent for a wearable video camera that sounded a lot like GoPro’s specialty. The action-camera maker’s stock sank about 12 per cent on the news.
Regardless of what Apple has cooking in its tightly veiled labs, experts say it is encouraging to see patent grants and R&D spending on the rise.
“I take it as a strong indication that innovation is alive and well at the company,” said Stephen Haber, a senior fellow at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Toronto Star,01-28-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/28/a-peek-inside-apples-rd-wish-list-reimaging-tv.html,11-18-2015
0,"Cassini Seeks Insights to Life in Plumes of Enceladus, Saturn’s Icy Moon","Where there is water, is there life?

That’s the $64 billion question now facing NASA and the rest of lonely humanity. When the New Horizons spacecraft, cameras clicking, sped past Pluto in July, it represented an inflection point in the conquest of the solar system. Half a century after the first planetary probe sailed past Venus, all the planets and would-be planets we have known and loved, and all the marvelous rocks and snowballs circling them, have been detected and inspected, reconnoitered.

That part of human history, the astrophysical exploration of the solar system, is over. The next part, the biological exploration of space, is just beginning. We have finished counting the rocks in the neighborhood. It is time to find out if anything is living on them, a job that could easily take another half century.

NASA’s mantra for finding alien life has long been to “follow the water,” the one ingredient essential to our own biochemistry. On Wednesday, NASA sampled the most available water out there, as the Cassini spacecraft plunged through an icy spray erupting from the little Saturnian moon Enceladus.

Enceladus is only 300 miles across and whiter than a Bing Crosby Christmas, reflecting virtually all the sunlight that hits it, which should make it colder and deader than Scrooge’s heart.

But in 2005, shortly after starting an 11-year sojourn at Saturn, Cassini recorded jets of water squirting from cracks known as tiger stripes near the south pole of Enceladus — evidence, scientists say, of an underground ocean kept warm and liquid by tidal flexing of the little moon as it is stretched and squeezed by Saturn.

And with that, Enceladus leapfrogged to the top of astrobiologists’ list of promising places to look for life. If there is life in its ocean, alien microbes could be riding those geysers out into space where a passing spacecraft could grab them. No need to drill through miles of ice or dig up rocks.

As Chris McKay, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center, said, it’s as if nature had hung up a sign at Enceladus saying “Free Samples.”

Discovering life was not on the agenda when Cassini was designed and launched two decades ago. Its instruments can’t capture microbes or detect life, but in a couple of dozen passes through the plumes of Enceladus, it has detected various molecules associated with life: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, molecular nitrogen, propane, acetylene, formaldehyde and traces of ammonia.

Wednesday’s dive was the deepest Cassini will make through the plumes, only 30 miles above the icy surface. Scientists are especially interested in measuring the amount of hydrogen gas in the plume, which would tell them how much energy and heat are being generated by chemical reactions in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the moon’s ocean.

It is in such ocean vents that some of the most primordial-looking life-forms have been found on our own planet. What the Cassini scientists find out could help set the stage for a return mission with a spacecraft designed to detect or even bring back samples of life.

These are optimistic, almost sci-fi times. The fact that life was present on Earth as early as 4.1 billion years ago — pretty much as soon as asteroids and leftover planet junk stopped bombarding the new Earth and let it cool down — has led astrobiologists to conclude that, given the right conditions, life will take hold quickly. Not just in our solar system, but in some of the thousands of planetary systems that Kepler and other missions squinting at distant stars have uncovered.

And if water is indeed the key, the solar system has had several chances to get lucky. Besides Enceladus, there is an ocean underneath the ice of Jupiter’s moon Europa, and the Hubble Space Telescope has hinted that it too is venting into space. NASA has begun planning for a mission next decade to fly by it.

And of course there’s Mars, with its dead oceans and intriguing streaks of damp sand, springboard of a thousand sci-fi invasions of Earth, but in recent decades the target of robot invasions going the other direction.

Some scientists even make the case that genesis happened not on Earth but on Mars. Our biochemical ancestors would then have made the passage on an asteroid, making us all Martians and perhaps explaining our curious attraction to the Red Planet.

And then there is Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere and lakes on its surface, except that in this case the liquid in them is methane and the beaches and valleys are made of hydrocarbon slush.

NASA’s working definition of life, coined by a group of biologists in 1992, is “a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.”

Any liquid could serve as the medium of this thing, process, whatever it is. Life on Titan would expand our notions of what is biochemically possible out there in the rest of the universe.

Our history of exploration suggests that surprise is the nature of the game. That was the lesson of the Voyager missions: Every world or moon encountered on that twin-spacecraft odyssey was different, an example of the laws of physics sculpted by time and circumstance into unique and weird forms.

And so far that is the lesson of the new astronomy of exoplanets — thousands of planetary systems, but not a single one that looks like our own.

The detection of a single piece of pond slime, one alien microbe, on some other world would rank as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science. Why should we expect it to look anything like what we already know?

That microbe won’t come any cheaper than the Higgs boson, the keystone of modern particle physics, which cost more than $10 billion to hunt down over half a century.

Finding that microbe will involve launching big, complicated chunks of hardware to various corners of the solar system, and that means work for engineers, scientists, accountants, welders, machinists, electricians, programmers and practitioners of other crafts yet to be invented — astro-robot-paleontologists, say.

However many billions of dollars it takes to knock on doors and find out if anybody is at home, it will all be spent here on Earth, on people and things we all say we want: innovation, education, science, technology.

We’ve seen this have a happy ending before. It was the kids of the aerospace industry and the military-industrial complex, especially in California, who gave us Silicon Valley and general relativity in our pockets.

In this era, a happy ending could include the news that we are not alone, that the cosmos is more diverse, again, than we had imagined.

Or not.

0,DNA of Ancient Children Offers Clues on How People Settled the Americas,"Researchers have long wondered how people settled the Americas, particularly the path they took to the new territory and the timing of their expansion. Until recently, archaeologists studying these questions were limited mostly to digging up skeletons and artifacts.

But now scientists have begun extracting DNA from human bones, and the findings are providing new glimpses at the history of the first Americans. On Monday, researchers at the University of Alaska and elsewhere published an important addition to the growing genetic archive.

In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reported that they had recovered DNA from two skeletons of children who lived in Alaska 11,500 years ago. The genetic material is not only among the oldest ever found in the Americas, but also the first ancient DNA discovered in Beringia, the region around the Bering Strait where many researchers believe Asians first settled before spreading through North and South America.

The archaeological site, near Upward Sun River, was discovered in 2010. Excavations there have revealed that between 13,200 and 8,000 years ago, people visited during the summer, catching salmon and hares. They built tentlike structures where they made fires and slept.

In 2011, archaeologists discovered cremated bones on a hearth at the site. Research revealed that the bones belonged to a 3-year-old child. Below the hearth, the team discovered a burial pit containing the skeletons of two other children.

One of the buried children was an infant who died a few months after birth; the other was likely a late-term fetus. After the baby and the fetus died, their bodies were carefully laid atop a bed of red ocher, surrounded by antlers fashioned into hunting darts.

“These things we hardly ever find — it’s a very rare window into the worldview of these people,” said Ben A. Potter, an archaeologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who has led the research at Upward Sun River.

Clearly, the children had been ceremonially buried. But why the two bodies ended up in the same grave is impossible to know. With the consent of Native American tribes that live around the site, Dr. Potter and his colleagues drilled small pieces of bone from the two skeletons and sent them to geneticists at the University of Utah.

The vast majority of our DNA lies in the nucleus of the cell. But the cell’s energy factories, called mitochondria, also carry small bits of their own DNA inherited solely from our mothers.

Because each cell can contain hundreds of mitochondria, it is easier to reconstruct their DNA than that of the cellular nuclei. The Utah geneticists focused their search on mitochondrial DNA in the Upward Sun River bones.

They succeeded in recovering mitochondrial DNA from both bone samples. But to their surprise, the genes were markedly different. The infant and the fetus did not share the same mother or even maternal grandmother.

The researchers can only speculate how an infant and a fetus from different mothers ended up in the same grave. They might have had the same father, or they might have belonged to different families who suffered terrible losses at the same time.

But the significance of the DNA found at Upward Sun River extends far beyond the story of two children. It sheds light on how people first moved into the Americas.

In 2007, Ripan Malhi of the University of Illinois and his colleagues proposed a model for this migration, known as the Beringian Standstill. Early Siberians expanded east into Beringia about 25,000 years ago, they proposed, and stayed there for about 10,000 years.

Humans were able to thrive in Beringia because even at the height of the last ice age, the region was not covered by glaciers. It was mainly tundra and shrub land, with scattered stands of trees.

Humans could not expand eastward into the rest of the Americas because they were blocked by glaciers. About 15,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the standstill came to an end.

“It opened up new ecological zones that were being colonized by plants and animals,” said Dennis O’Rourke of the University of Utah, a co-author of the new study.

According to the standstill hypothesis, the ancestors of Native Americans would have built up a large degree of genetic diversity in the thousands of years they were confined to Beringia — more so than if these populations had migrated directly from Siberia to the Americas.

The fact that two children who died at roughly the same time in the same community shared so few genes is consistent with the idea that the population was prevented from moving into the Americas for thousands of years, Dr. O’Rourke said.

But the two children died after the glaciers melted, he noted, and their settlement “may well be a remnant of that original Beringian group. It may give us a snapshot of that earlier time.”

Dr. Malhi, who was not involved in the new study, thought the new DNA was too recent to provide proof of the idea that humans were trapped in Beringia for thousands of years. “It’s valuable information, but it’s a little bit late to be extremely informative to let us know if the Beringian Standstill hypothesis holds,” he said.

More conclusive findings would be possible if scientists found older DNA from people who lived during the Beringian Standstill. Archaeologists are now looking for skeletons from that age, but Dr. Malhi is not holding his breath.

Many of the sites where people lived may now be impossible to reach, because sea levels rose at the end of the ice age.

”There are archaeologists up there looking for such sites,” Dr. Malhi said. “But I think it’s probably unlikely, largely because a lot of Beringia is now under water.”",Health/Science,Hard Science,New York Times,10-16-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/science/dna-of-ancient-children-offers-clues-on-how-people-settled-the-americas.html,11-26-2015
0,Bird Eggs Are Fertilized by More Than One Sperm,"Bird eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm, a process called polyspermy. Penetration by multiple sperm may be unusual in the animal kingdom, but it is somehow crucial to the development of the bird embryo, a new study finds.

“In humans and mammals, you only need one sperm to penetrate the egg,” said Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield and one of the study’s authors. “If there’s more than one, it can be lethal and we end up with the embryo dying.”

Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues studied eggs from zebra finches and chickens. They inseminated the finches with low doses of sperm, from one to 15, and compared this result with naturally fertilized eggs, which may be fertilized by 10 to hundreds of sperm.

Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues also inseminated chickens with a low dose of sperm: approximately 10,000. Other chickens were inseminated with 10 million sperm.

The researchers found that when few sperm penetrated the egg, the bird embryo was unlikely to survive. They report their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Exactly why the extra sperm are needed is unknown.

“Although the sperm do seem to be required for the embryo to survive, we don’t know how they contribute to the process of fertilization,” Dr. Hemmings said. Extra sperm may somehow support cell cycles necessary for early embryo development.

The research could help scientists develop more successful programs for endangered species in captive breeding programs, Dr. Hemmings added.",Health/Science,Hard Science,New York Times,11-02-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/bird-eggs-are-fertilized-by-more-than-one-sperm.html,11-26-2015
0,The Look of Love Is in the Dog’s Eyes,"Those big brown eyes gaze at you, deeply. Your heart leaps. You caress, murmuring sweet nothings. And as those big browns remain fixed on you, the tail wags.

Devoted dog. Besotted owner. That continuous loop of loving reinforcement may begin with the dog’s gaze, according to a new report in Science.

Japanese researchers found that dogs who trained a long gaze on their owners had elevated levels of oxytocin, a hormone produced in the brain that is associated with nurturing and attachment, similar to the feel-good feedback that bolsters bonding between parent and child. After receiving those long gazes, the owners’ levels of oxytocin increased, too.

The dog’s gaze cues connection and response in the owner, who will reward the dog by gazing, talking and touching, all of which helps solder the two, the researchers said. They suggest that dogs became domesticated in part by adapting to a primary human means of contact: eye-to-eye communication.

And when researchers gave dogs extra oxytocin through a nasal spray, the female dogs (though not the males) gazed at their owners even longer, which in turn boosted the owners’ oxytocin levels.

“What’s unique about this study is that it demonstrates that oxytocin can boost social gaze interaction between two very different species,” said Steve Chang, an assistant professor of psychology and neurobiology at Yale who was not involved in this latest research.

Dr. Chang, who studies oxytocin in animals, noted that through domestication, dogs came to regard humans as their “key social partners,” while humans also came to view dogs as social partners.

“In a way, domesticated dogs could hijack our social circuits, and we can hijack their social circuits,” he said in an email, as each species learned how to raise the other’s oxytocin levels, facilitating connection.

The researchers also tested wolves raised by humans to see whether a wolf-to-owner gaze would raise oxytocin levels in either or both. But compared with dogs, the wolves scarcely gazed at their owners, and the owners’ oxytocin levels barely budged.

Unlike dogs, wolves “tend to use eye contact as a threat” and are inclined to “avoid human eye contact,” wrote Miho Nagasawa, a study author and research fellow at Jichi Medical University.

In an email, Dr. Takefumi Kikusui, a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine at Azabu University, wrote that he believes that the differences in gaze between dogs and wolves means “that dogs have acquired this superior ability during the evolutionary and domestication process of living with humans.”

He continued: “There is a possibility that dogs cleverly and unknowingly utilized a natural system meant for bonding a parent with his or her child.”

In the first experiment, researchers measured oxytocin levels in the urine of 30 owners and dogs before and after they interacted for 30 minutes. The dogs were males and females, spayed, neutered and intact. The breeds included Golden retrievers, standard poodles, miniature Dachshunds, miniature Schnauzers, a Jack Russell Terrier, and two mixed breed. They also measured oxytocin in five wolves and their owners.

The changes in oxytocin were most pronounced in dogs who fixed longer gazes on their owners, which researchers defined as 100 seconds in the first five minutes of the encounter. They saw no significant difference in oxytocin levels among the breeds or sex of the dogs.

In the second experiment, researchers administered nasal sprays of either saline or oxytocin to dogs. This time, each dog entered a room with three humans: its owner and two strangers. But now, only the female dogs who were given the oxytocin displayed an even longer gaze at their owners, who in turn had spikes in their oxytocin levels. Researchers could not say why the sex of the dog mattered. But they speculated that vigilance in male dogs, set off by the presence of the two strangers, may have moderated the effects of oxytocin.

Other experts on canine behavior expressed caution about overstating the implications of this study.

Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, called the study “a fascinating direction of research, because it looks at connections between behavioral measures and hormonal components.” She noted that it raised many intriguing questions: about long and short gazes; why only female dogs reacted to the oxytocin dose; whether other breeds would yield different results. But pointing to the small size of the sample, she added, “I don’t know how it proves the domestication thesis.”

And then there is the meaning of a dog’s “gaze.” The human gaze is layered with nuance. Dog owners may ascribe similar complexity to their dog’s gaze, certain that they, like parents, can interpret it. (A view endorsed by this owner of a Havanese, whose eager, soulful gaze is both long and expressive, punctuated by cocking his head, and fluttering his ears forward. Speaks volumes.) “If your dog’s gaze helps you think your dog understands you,” said Dr. Horowitz, “that produces bonding.”

But Evan L. MacLean, co-director of the Duke Canine Cognition Center and a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study, said, “We don’t know what the dog’s gaze means. When you look at a human baby, it feels good. Maybe dogs gaze at you because it feels good. Maybe the dogs are hugging you with their eyes?”

But Dr. MacLean, an evolutionary anthropologist, said that fundamentally, for dogs, human behavior is “the telltale of everything that is about to happen.” Are we going to stand or sit? Leave the room? Bring food?

And so they stare at us, fixedly.

“If I was dropped on Mars,” Dr. MacLean said, “and everyone was speaking a language I didn’t understand, and I knew I could never acquire their language, I’d just give up. But dogs don’t. They’re not reluctant to tune in to us at every moment.”",Health/Science,Hard Science,New York Times,04-16-2015,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/the-look-of-love-is-in-the-dogs-eyes/,11-26-2015
0,"Homo Naledi, New Species in Human Lineage, Is Found in South African Cave","Acting on a tip from spelunkers two years ago, scientists in South Africa discovered what the cavers had only dimly glimpsed through a crack in a limestone wall deep in the Rising Star Cave: lots and lots of old bones.

The remains covered the earthen floor beyond the narrow opening. This was, the scientists concluded, a large, dark chamber for the dead of a previously unidentified species of the early human lineage — Homo naledi.

The new hominin species was announced on Thursday by an international team of more than 60 scientists led by Lee R. Berger, an American paleoanthropologist who is a professor of human evolution studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The species name, H. naledi, refers to the cave where the bones lay undisturbed for so long; “naledi” means “star” in the local Sesotho language.

In two papers published this week in the open-access journal eLife, the researchers said that the more than 1,550 fossil elements documenting the discovery constituted the largest sample for any hominin species in a single African site, and one of the largest anywhere in the world. Further, the scientists said, that sample is probably a small fraction of the fossils yet to be recovered from the chamber. So far the team has recovered parts of at least 15 individuals.

“With almost every bone in the body represented multiple times, Homo naledi is already practically the best-known fossil member of our lineage,” Dr. Berger said.

The finding, like so many others in science, was the result of pure luck followed by considerable effort.

Two local cavers, Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker, found the narrow entrance to the chamber, measuring no more than seven and a half inches wide. They were skinny enough to squeeze through, and in the light of their headlamps they saw the bones all around them. When they showed the fossil pictures to Pedro Boshoff, a caver who is also a geologist, he alerted Dr. Berger, who organized an investigation.

Just getting into the chamber and bringing out samples proved to be a huge challenge. The narrow opening was the only way in.

Paul Dirks, a geologist at James Cook University in Australia, who was lead author of the journal paper describing the chamber, said the investigators first had a steep climb up a stone block called the Dragon’s Back and then a drop down to the entrance passage — all of this in the total absence of natural light.

For the two extended investigations of the chamber in 2013 and 2014, Dr. Berger rounded up the international team of scientists and then recruited six excavating scientists through notices on social media. One special requirement: They had to be slender enough to crawl through that crack in the wall.

One of the six, who were all women and were called “underground astronauts,” was Marina Elliott of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. She said the collection and removal of the fossils involved “some of the most difficult and dangerous conditions ever encountered in the search for human origins.”

Besides introducing a new member of the prehuman family, the discovery suggests that some early hominins intentionally deposited bodies of their dead in a remote and largely inaccessible cave chamber, a behavior previously considered limited to modern humans. Some of the scientists referred to the practice as a ritualized treatment of their dead, but by “ritual” they said they meant a deliberate and repeated practice, not necessarily a kind of religious rite.

“It’s very, very fascinating,” said Ian Tattersall, an authority on human evolution at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was not involved in the research.

“No question there’s at least one new species here,” he added, “but there may be debate over the Homo designation, though the species is quite different from anything else we have seen.”

A colleague of Dr. Tattersall’s at the museum, Eric Delson, who is a professor at Lehman College of the City University of New York, was also impressed, saying, “Berger does it again!”

Dr. Delson was referring to Dr. Berger’s previous headline discovery, published in 2010, also involving cave deposits near Johannesburg. He found many fewer fossils that time, but enough to conclude that he was looking at a new species, which he named Australopithecus sediba. Geologists said the individuals lived 1.78 million to 1.95 million years ago, when australopithecines and early species of Homo were contemporaries.

Researchers analyzing the H. naledi fossils have not yet nailed down their age, which is difficult to measure because of the muddled chamber sediments and the absence of other fauna remains nearby. Some of its primitive anatomy, like a brain no larger than an average orange, Dr. Berger said, indicated that the species evolved near or at the root of the Homo genus, meaning it must be in excess of 2.5 million to 2.8 million years old. Geologists think the cave is no older than three million years.

The field work and two years of analysis for Dr. Berger’s latest discovery were supported by the University of the Witwatersrand, the National Geographic Society and the South African Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation. In addition to the journal articles, the findings will be featured in the October issue of National Geographic Magazine and in a two-hour NOVA/National Geographic documentary to air Wednesday on PBS.

Scientists on the discovery team and those not involved in the research noted the mosaic of contrasting anatomical features, including more modern-looking jaws and teeth and feet, that warrant the hominin’s placement as a species in the genus Homo, not Australopithecus, the genus that includes the famous Lucy species that lived 3.2 million years ago. The hands of the newly discovered specimens reminded some scientists of the earliest previously identified specimens of Homo habilis, who were apparently among the first toolmakers.

At a news conference on Wednesday, John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a senior author of the paper describing the new species, said it was “unlike any other species seen before,” noting that a small skull with a brain one-third the size of modern human braincases was perched atop a very slender body. An average H. naledi was about five feet tall and weighed almost 100 pounds, he said.

Tracy Kivell of the University of Kent, in England, an associate of Dr. Berger’s team, was struck by H. naledi’s “extremely curved fingers, more curved than almost any other species of early hominin, which clearly demonstrates climbing capabilities.”

William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College, another researcher at the Museum of Natural History, led the analysis of the feet of the new species, which he said are “virtually indistinguishable from those of modern humans.” These feet, combined with its long legs, suggest that H. naledi was well suited for upright long-distance walking, Dr. Harcourt-Smith said.

In an accompanying commentary in the journal, Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, found overall similarities between the new species and fossils from Dmanisi, in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, dated to about 1.8 million years ago. The Georgian specimens are usually assigned to an early variety of Homo erectus.

Much remains to be discovered in the Rising Star Cave, like determining the ages of the fossils and the evolutionary position of H. naledi in the genus Homo and the human family tree. The discovery chamber has not given up all of its secrets. “There are potentially hundreds if not thousands of remains of H. naledi still down there,” Dr. Berger said.

At the news conference in South Africa on Thursday announcing the findings, Dr. Berger said: “I do believe that the field of paleoanthropology had convinced itself, as much as 15 years ago, that we had found everything, that we were not going to make major discoveries and had this story of our origins figured out. I think many people quit exploring, thought it was safer to conduct science inside a lab or behind a computer.” What the new species Naledi says, Dr. Berger concluded, “is that there is no substitute for exploration.”",Health/Science,Hard Science,New York Times,09-10-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/science/south-africa-fossils-new-species-human-ancestor-homo-naledi.html,11-26-2015
0,"Want to be happy for life? Get religion, study suggests","A new study suggests that joining a religious group could do more for someone’s “sustained happiness” than other forms of social participation, such as volunteering, playing sports or taking a class.
A study in the American Journal of Epidemiology by researchers at the London School of Economics and Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands found that the secret to sustained happiness lies in participation in religion.
“The church appears to play a very important social role in keeping depression at bay and also as a coping mechanism during periods of illness in later life,” Mauricio Avendano, an epidemiologist at LSE and an author of the study, said in a statement. “It is not clear to us how much this is about religion per se, or whether it may be about the sense of belonging and not being socially isolated.”
Researchers looked at four areas: volunteering or working with a charity; taking educational courses; participating in religious organizations and participating in a political or community organization.
Of the four, participating in a religious organization was the only social activity associated with sustained happiness, researchers found. The study analyzed 9,000 Europeans who were over the age of 50.
The report also found that joining political or community organizations lose their benefits over time. In fact, the short-term benefits from those social connections often lead to depressive symptoms later on, researchers say.
Although healthier people are more likely to volunteer, the researchers found no evidence that volunteering actually leads to better mental health. Benefits could be outweighed by other negative impacts of volunteering, such as stress, Avendano said.
The researchers noted that it is unclear whether the benefits of participating in a religious organization are connected to being in the religious community or to the faith itself.

0,The war on brains,"Of all national assets, archives are the most precious. They are the gift of one generation to another and the extent of our care of them marks the extent of our civilization.
— Sir Arthur Doughty, former chief archivist of Canada
Maybe the muzzling of climate scientists did pay off for Harper and Tories who didn’t want Canadians to spend too much time thinking about the climate: from 2007 to 2012, the volume of media coverage of climate change issues fell by 80 per cent.
When the Harper government held closed-door meetings to talk about ways to cut Environment Canada’s budget by $60 million in the 2012 federal budget, Harper’s team made sure communications specialists were in the room. Records labelled “secret advice to the minister” were part of 500 pages of briefing material prepared for a new deputy minister when she arrived at Environment Canada a few months after the meetings.
“Strategists from the communication branch were involved in Environment Canada’s deliberations on its contribution to the deficit action reduction plan from the beginning,” said the records, released through Access to Information. They also showed that Environment Canada’s human resources branch managers stayed in touch with both the Prime Minister’s Office and the Privy Council Office.
“That sounds a bit backwards to me,” Gary Corbett, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, which represents about 60,000 government scientists and professionals, told Postmedia journalist Mike De Souza. “It’s wrong for communications people to be involved in deciding what decisions to make. Communications people are there to communicate the decisions after they’re made. It seems the government is just being political rather than [doing] what’s in the best interests of Canadians.”
The Harper government is especially sensitive about any scientific research that shows the extraction of oil from the bitumen sands of northern Alberta is a threat to the environment or to people. Environment Canada researchers Derek Muir and Jane Kirk agreed with findings by University of Alberta scientists Erin Kelly and David Schindler that contaminants are accumulating in snow near the oilsands quarries. While the university scientists could discuss their findings with the media, the government scientists could not.
The University of Alberta scientists’ report was presented in November 2011 at a conference in Boston of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. “[Environment Canada’s] research conducted during winter 2010–11 confirms results already published by the University of Alberta that show contaminants in snow in the oilsands area,” an Environment Canada memorandum admitted, but the authors of the document warned: “If scientists are approached for interviews at the conference, the EC [Environment Canada] communications policy will be followed by referring the journalist to the media relations . . . phone number. An appropriate spokesperson will then be identified depending on journalist questions.”
The document was obtained through Access to Information by Postmedia’s Mike De Souza, who had been bird-dogging the government on its cover-up of data that might cause trouble for oil extraction companies. (Their problem was solved when De Souza was laid off in 2014, when Postmedia shut down its Ottawa bureau. The Postmedia chain no longer has a full-time environment reporter on Parliament Hill.)
Environment Canada scientists were told to say, “I am a scientist. I’m not in a position to answer that question, but I’d be happy to refer you to an appropriate spokesperson.” The official line was: “We are comparing the levels of contamination we found in our work to other studies and find that other studies report both higher and lower levels. These efforts will allow us to better understand deposition patterns and levels of oilsands related contaminants with a view to better identify their sources and ecological risks.”
By the sixth year of the Harper regime, most scientists knew it was foolish and dangerous to try to buck the system. The Index on Censorship took a survey of 4,000 Canadian scientists in 2013. Only 14 per cent said they felt they would be able to share a concern about public health and safety, or a threat to the environment, without fear of retaliation or censure from their department or agency.
Once the Harper government had scientists under its control, it went after their research libraries. First, Health Canada turned over its interlibrary loan system to a company called Infotrieve. Every time a researcher wanted material from a scientific journal article, a book from a university library or a publication from a federal or provincial agency, Infotrieve billed the scientist’s department. To save money and aggravation, some research scientists started borrowing university library cards from co-op students and friends who taught in universities so they could get the interlibrary loan material for free. Others had to ask friends working for private companies to get government-owned research material for them.
Health Canada’s head office library was shut down. The books and journals, essential for serious research, were sent to the National Science Library on the Ottawa campus of the National Research Council in 2013. Rudi Mueller, who left Health Canada in 2012, says the department simply did not want it to be easy for scientists to use libraries. “I look at it as an insidious plan to discourage people from using libraries,” Mueller said. “If you want to justify closing a library, you make access difficult and then you say it is hardly used.”
Scientists like Mueller were not just kept away from books. They were also unable to get help from trained science librarians who know how to track down publications that are obscure, rare or hard to get. Health Canada had 40 of these librarians. In April 2013, it had six. “A librarian is far better at doing a literature search than I am,” Mueller said. “It’s their profession.” Mueller said the research support system had become absurd and, by the end of his career with Health Canada, he believed he wasn’t able to do his work properly.
At least one Health Canada scientist started his own library, squirrelling away 250 feet of shelf space worth of books and journals in his basement. Friends who work for the department email him with requests, and the scientist tracks the material down and brings it to work.
If the plan was designed to save money, it’s been a failure. Health Canada Library Services had a staff of 36 and a budget of $1.75 million in 2008–2009. In 2013–2014 there was a staff of six and the cost had risen to $2.67 million. On top of that, each time a Health Canada scientist needs a document, the department has to pay a $25.65 retrieval fee plus the courier bill from the National Science Library. Scientists are charged $9 for a scanned, emailed document.
Former Green Party activist Katie Gibbs, who holds a PhD in biology specializing in conservation science, organized the Death of Evidence marches in 2012. She believes the Harper government doesn’t want to hear from scientists, even those who work in the federal bureaucracy. “I think there are multiple ways to avoid using scientific evidence in policy development. One way is to not collect it and get rid of historical documentary information,” Gibbs said.
“A picture does say a thousand words. You see pictures of dumpsters full of books. It’s alarming. You see lots of examples of private companies picking up these books. I’ve heard from so many scientists who took the material home because they couldn’t stand to see this material thrown out. Scientists are sending out emails to each other saying what they have stored away. It’s having an impact on the ability of scientists to do their job,” she said.
Historians have faced the same kind of cuts. In Harper’s Canada, history comes from the Centre, not from the work of the professors and authors who depend on easy access to the vast collection of documents and pictures at Library and Archives Canada (LAC). Inside its Ottawa building, just a block from Parliament Hill, services have been slashed, employee morale is dismal and visiting scholars are angry.
The words “dusty” and “archives” are usually used in the same breath by people who don’t understand that history is a living thing that can, and often is, remade to suit political agendas. History is also often hidden by governments that want to write their own narrative of what a country’s about. The archives is so poor that it’s missed out on important historical letters, a collection of narratives from fugitive slaves in Upper Canada from 1856, and letters from British colonial officials on the state of First Nations in eastern Canada during pioneer times. In 2008–2009, Library and Archives Canada spent $385,461 on historic documents. In 2011–2012 it spent nothing. In Washington, the Library of Congress’s acquisition budget was between $18 million and $19 million annually from 2009 to 2012.
In the early years of this century, Library and Archives Canada started working on a project to make its collection accessible to everyone. First, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King’s diary and documents from New France were posted on the Internet. Probably the department’s heart was in the right place, but the plan has been a failure. Six years into the digitalization project, there was very little to show for it except frustration, with LAC staff and managers unable to get the system running properly and Canadians finding it not very helpful.
When people have asked for material that is politically sensitive, Library and Archives Canada, prompted by its overseers in the Heritage Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office, has dug in its heels. Since 2005, Canadian Press reporter Jim Bronskill has been trying to see the RCMP security service file on one-time federal NDP leader and Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas, who died in 1986. The file is 1,149 pages thick, but Bronskill received just 400 heavily censored pages when he filed his first request. Library and Archives Canada released another 300 pages of the file just before Bronskill’s case was heard by the Federal Court, and Bronskill got some more of the file after the court ruled in his favour. The material that has been released shows the country’s national police force tailed a mainstream elected politician for almost 60 years and watched him long after he retired to see if he was involved with communists, members of the peace movement or anyone else identified by the police as a danger to the state.
The federal government outsourced some of the archives’ work to ancestry.ca, a for-profit website used by genealogists. People can go to the archives building and use this service without paying, but if they to want use census material from the comfort of their home, they’d better have their credit card handy.
To do the job right, a national archives still needs archivists — many of them skilled historians — to help professional and amateur researchers who come to Ottawa to use the collection. But rather than increase Library and Archives Canada’s budget so it can do its job, the Harper government has cut it. It may scold Canadians and immigrants for not knowing their history, but it has made it much harder for people to study and write about the past. Along with preventing the archives from adding to the nation’s collection, cuts have manifested themselves in reduced hours, slower service, lack of access to important documents, and slashing of staff. The ones who still have their jobs often seem overwhelmed and overworked.
In May 2012, more than 200 people, many of them experts with unique skills and years of experience, lost their jobs. People who arranged for loans of material in the collection, specialists who preserved microfilm, digital experts and reference librarians were tossed out. Training was cut. Half the LAC circulation staff who dealt with analog material — what the rest of us call books and documents — were fired. The library also killed its interlibrary loan program. In its last year in the interlibrary loan system, the national library lent 20,000 books to people across the country, often in isolated communities.
Morale among the surviving staff, which was never very good, has tanked. Rather than deal with the lousy work environment, Daniel Caron, the former head of Library and Archives Canada, simply gagged his employees. He was trained as an economist, not a librarian or archivist, and his tenure saw a rapid deterioration in services and morale. Like other managers in the Harper government, Caron wanted to put the screws to employees who might gripe to the public.
Caron and his management team came up with a code of conduct banning librarians and archivists from setting foot in classrooms, attending conferences and speaking at public meetings, whether on the institution’s time or their own. The 23 pages of rules, called “Library and Archives Canada’s Code of Conduct: Values and Ethics,” came into effect in January 2013. Employees could get special dispensation from their bosses, but the fine print of the gag order made it unlikely that permission would be granted. The rules called public speaking, whether to university students, genealogy groups, historians and even other archivists and librarians, “high risk” activities that could create conflicts of interest or “other risks to LAC.” The code stressed federal employees’ “duty of loyalty” not to history or to Library and Archives Canada, but rather to the “duly elected government.” Employees breaking the code could find themselves reported to LAC managers by colleagues who turned them in on what James Turk, executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, called a “snitch line.”
“As public servants, our duty of loyalty to the Government of Canada and its elected officials extends beyond our workplace to our personal activities,” the code said. It reminded librarians and archivists, many of whom do not consider themselves public menaces, that they must maintain awareness of their surroundings, their audience and how their words or actions could be interpreted (or misinterpreted). They were warned not to fall into the trap of social media. And LAC employees were warned that teaching a class or speaking at a conference put them at special risk, since “such activities have been identified as high risk to Library and Archives Canada and to the employee with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty.”
In March 2013, Harper’s hometown paper, the Calgary Herald, editorialized: “The code appears overly concerned with what an employee might say about the federal government. Speaking at a conference about the role of archivists, for example, cannot by anyone’s wildest imagination be construed as disloyal. This unwarranted dictate severely limiting the librarians’ and archivists’ freedom of speech is intolerable and must be reversed.”
Caron was one person who was allowed to speak out. “Library and Archives Canada’s Code of Conduct for its employees is wholly consistent with the values of the Public Service of Canada,” he wrote in a letter to the editor of the Ottawa Citizen. “Library and Archives Canada’s Code of Conduct does not prevent Library and Archives employees from engaging in external activities. However, for all public servants, the right to freedom of expression must be balanced with their responsibility to remain impartial and effective in their professional duties. This is commonly applied in the private and public sector.”
That chattiness came to an abrupt end in May 2013, after Caron was called into Heritage Minister James Moore’s office to explain why Library and Archives Canada’s leader billed the government nearly $4,500 for Spanish lessons. Soon afterwards, the New Democrats released a document outlining what the party’s heritage critic, Pierre Nantel, called Caron’s “titanic expenses.” The publicly available figures show Caron filed $87,000 in expense claims in each of 2011 and 2012. Moore’s own expenses were about $46,000 in each of those years. Caron submitted expenses for business lunches in Ottawa’s best restaurants and the private Rideau Club, and for rooms in expensive hotels in Quebec City and Puerto Rico, along with trips to Toronto, Europe and Australia. Suddenly, Caron was out of a job.
Just a month after Caron left, the archives finally opened its wallet to buy some Canadiana. It was obvious Library and Archives Canada had learned a lesson on how to serve its masters in the Prime Minister’s Office. Library and Archives Canada chipped in with the Canadian Museum of Civilization (now the Canadian Museum of History) to spend almost $700,000 on a collection of documents and artifacts belonging to Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. It fit with the War of 1812 fetish. The collection was described as “the largest and most complete collection of War of 1812 documentation ever” in the government’s announcement, which was made by Heritage Minister Moore.
Library and Archives Canada would carry on, at least for War of 1812 buffs, but its staff would continue to tread very, very carefully.

0,Scientists reveal why Indian food tastes so good,"Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world. The labour-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, tamarind and other flavours can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.
But behind the appeal of Indian food — what makes it so novel and so delicious — is also a stranger and subtler truth. In a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why Indian food tastes so unique: it does something radical with flavours, something very different from what we tend to do in the United States and the rest of western culture. And it does it at the molecular level.
Before we go further, let’s take a step back and consider what flavours are and how they interact. If you were to hold a microscope to most western dishes, you would find an interesting but not all-too-surprising trend. Popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavours, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts — precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste.
Most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is acetal, which, as the food chemist George Burdock has written, is “refreshing, pleasant, and (has a) fruity-green odour.” It can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. On average, there are just over 50 flavour compounds in each food ingredient.
A chart shared by Scientific American in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavour compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavour compounds in common. Peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there). But there are connections that are more difficult to predict: strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey.
Chefs in the West like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavours. But not all cuisines adhere to the same rule. Many Asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favouring dishes with ingredients that don’t overlap in flavour. And Indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful counter-examples.
Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called TarlaDalal.com. They broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavour compounds.
The answer? Not too often.
The researchers examined several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients. They looked at how much the underlying flavour compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from western cuisines. Indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavours don’t overlap at all.
“We found that average flavour sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,” the researchers wrote.
In other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavour, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish.
More specifically, many Indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in dishes such as red curry, green curry, or massaman curry. And when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, it’s unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavours. The same can be said of green bell pepper, coriander and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in Indian cuisine.
“Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavour sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,” the researchers noted.
Milk, butter, bread and rice, meanwhile — all of which are hallmarks of western cuisine — were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavour pairings that match. When any of those ingredients appeared in an Indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavour overlap.
The take-away is that part of what makes Indian food unique is the way flavours rub up against each other. The cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average Indian dish, after all, contains at least seven ingredients. But all those ingredients are important because in any single dish, each one brings its own flavour.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Toronto Star,03-06-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/03/06/scientists-reveal-why-indian-food-tastes-so-good.html,11-26-2015
0,Canadian physicist wins Nobel Prize for work on neutrinos,"Canadian physicist Arthur B. McDonald has won the Nobel Prize for discoveries about the behaviour of a mysterious solar particle, teased from an experiment buried two kilometres below Sudbury.
The Queen’s University professor emeritus was honoured for co-discovering that elusive particles known as neutrinos can change their identity — or “oscillate” — as they travel from the sun. It proved that neutrinos must have mass, a finding that upset the Standard Model of particle physics and opened new avenues for research into the fundamental properties of the universe.
McDonald, 72, shares the prize with Takaaki Kajita, whose Japanese collaboration made the same discovery with slightly different methods.
To measure solar neutrinos, McDonald and a 130-person international team built a massive detector in an operational copper mine southwest of Sudbury. The location allowed the experiment to be highly sensitive but created enormous logistical challenges. Construction on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory — SNO — began in 1990. The experiment collected its first data nine years later.
“I think we all knew that if we could manage to do it, it would be a very significant measurement. And that’s the way it turned out,” McDonald said Tuesday, 10 “crazy” hours after he was awakened by a telephone call from Sweden telling him he had won the prize in physics.
SNO has since expanded to become SNOLAB, with more particle experiments underway.
“What we’re really pleased about is that we are able to do experiments that can give Canadians and our international collaborators, particularly the young people, a real eureka moment.”

The SNO detector solved a long-standing mystery in physics: the case of the missing neutrinos. Theoretical models indicated there should be far more neutrinos streaming from the sun than earthly instruments were detecting. Either we didn’t understand the sun, or we didn’t understand neutrinos — highly abundant but very elusive subatomic particles that barely interact with matter, and were thought to have no mass.
To solve this problem, McDonald and his colleagues dreamt up SNO. Deep in an INCO mine (now owned by Vale), protected from cosmic radiation constantly bombarding the earth’s surface, the scientists installed a 12-metre-wide acrylic vessel filled with 1,000 tonnes of ultra-pure heavy water. The vessel was surrounded by a geodesic sphere equipped with 9,456 light sensors. The whole thing was sunk in a 34-metre-high cavity filled with regular water.
When neutrinos hit the heavy water, an event that occurred about 10 times a day, they emitted a flash of light, which researchers could analyze to measure the particles’ properties.
Neutrinos come in three identities or “flavours”: electron, tau and muon. By 2001, SNO showed that neutrinos were switching flavours in transit. To do so, they must have mass.
Once all three flavours were measured, the sun’s neutrinos were properly accounted for. The discovery spun out generations of new science — better understanding neutrinos might solve the riddle of why the universe is dominated by matter instead of being empty, for one.
“Art McDonald is an extraordinary scientist and scientific leader,” said Pekka Sinervo, a University of Toronto particle physicist who helped provide oversight for SNO in its early days and currently chairs SNOLAB’s board of directors. “He kept the collaboration moving forward, even in dark days where nothing seemed to be going right (and there were some of those).”
The discovery “took quite a bit of ingenuity and investment in major experimental science facilities,” said physics and astronomy professor Ray Jayawardhana, York University’s dean of science and author of the book Neutrino Hunters.
Building SNO cost $73 million, not including the value of the heavy water, which would have rung in at $200 million if it hadn’t been “loaned” by AECL, Canada’s federal nuclear agency.
“It is certainly not cheap. But the investment paid off . . . here we are 15 years later being recognized for that wonderful finding,” said Jayawardhana.

McDonald grew up in Nova Scotia and earned two physics degrees from Dalhousie University. He credits his parents, his high school math teacher in Sydney, N.S., and Dalhousie professors as early inspirations. He began his career at Ontario’s Chalk River nuclear research labs before moving to Princeton in 1982.
He came back to Canada in 1989 to direct SNO and take up a professorship at Queen’s, where he has been ever since. He is still involved in research at SNOLAB, which is investigating dark matter as well as neutrino science.
“We’re very fortunate in Canada to have this opportunity with SNOLAB,” McDonald said. “It’s just marvellous to be able to stimulate the next generation of students with experiments just as cutting edge as what we were doing with SNO 20 years ago.”
Prime Minister Stephen Harper congratulated the professor in a statement.
“Dr. McDonald’s award solidifies Canada’s reputation of having some of the best and brightest scientists and many of the most respected universities and research facilities in the world,” he said.
“I am certain that Dr. McDonald’s extraordinary accomplishment will further inspire our scientific community and I hope that it will encourage young Canadians who may be considering science as a career choice across the country.”
Congratulations poured in from all over, including from the Royal Societies of both Canada and the U.K., where McDonald is a fellow; the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, where McDonald is on the board of directors; and the small but proud Science North, an education centre in Sudbury, where McDonald has an honorary lifetime membership.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Toronto Star,10-06-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/10/06/canadian-physicist-wins-nobel-prize-for-work-on-neutrinos.html,11-26-2015
0,Has Earth entered the anthropocene epoch?,"Death and rebirth are the bookends of time.
For over 4.5 billion years, each day on Earth has begun the same way: with the rising of the sun.
But earth scientists look for greater changes, choosing great extinctions or periods of evolution to mark the passing of one geological period into another.
Our destiny, some might argue, first began when fish climbed out of the primordial oceans and onto the shore some 400 million years ago during the Paleozoic Era.
But it was during the Holocene Epoch, after the Pleistocene Ice Ages ended, that humans turned from hunting and gathering to organizing social groups, thus forming the civilizations of the world.
Some say we are still in the Holocene. But others have begun to wonder if we may now be living in a new epoch, one defined by the environmental consequences of man.
This new time period, dubbed the anthropocene in 2000 by biologist Eugene F. Stoermer and Nobel-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, it marks the most recent interval of geological time that is characterized by how human activities forever changed the geography and climate of the planet.
But when, exactly, was that?
If the anthropocene were to become an official epoch, it would be the first time a geological boundary could be witnessed by scientifically literate human beings.
But first, scientists must come up with a start date. Some argue it began in the Industrial Revolution, when factories caused an increase in carbon emissions. Others have said it began earlier than that, when agriculture caused widespread deforestation. Still others have argued that it began much more recently, in the second half of the 20th century.
Alex Wolfe, a professor at University of Alberta, believes that the anthropocene started during the Great Acceleration, a term used by scientists to describe rapid climate change in the last half of the 20th century.
This is when, Wolfe said, human activity did more than just impact the planet — it actually started to control it.
Wolfe is in favour of formally recognizing the Anthropocene Epoch. But in order to find an official start date for the epoch, he said, we have to find a “geological horizon.”
As part of the Anthropocene Working Group, he published a paper in the Quaternary International that argued for a distinct start date: July 16, 1945, the Trinity atomic bomb tests.
Although that date carries great weight in the pages of human history, he said it was chosen not because it’s a metaphor, but because it can be measured. The bomb and subsequent nuclear fallout has left radioactive footprints in rock formations that will serve as a marker for thousands of years.
“We’re essentially using the nuclear test as a pageholder for a series of events that represent, in our mind, a transformation of the earth system,” he said.
But William Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia, thinks it goes back much farther than that.
“[The atom bomb] is an important marker in human history, but it’s not even close to the whole story,” he said.
In a paper published in the journal Science, Ruddiman argues that the anthropocene began thousands of years ago, when humans chopped down the forest to make way for agriculture.
“If you look out from space at the planet, the biggest change that would strike your eyes is that all these green forests have been turned into yellow meadows,” he said.
Starting the anthropocene in 1945, he said, would be like saying the Wild West was tamed when the Sears Tower was built in Chicago in 1970.
End of an epoch?
Right now, the anthropocene is an informal term used to describe a period of time when human impact on the planet became more pervasive. But in 2016, the International Commission on Stratigraphy will meet, and the Anthropocene Working Group hopes to submit a proposal in favour of making the Anthropocene Epoch an official time unit on the Geological Time Scale.
“Right now anthropocene means different things to different people,” Wolfe said, arguing that it would be more useful if everyone could agree on what it is and when it began.
“These transformations are apace, they were begun decades ago, and their fingerprint is . . . absolutely pervasive,” he said.
But Ruddiman said that while he thinks it’s a useful term, he’s against turning the “little a” into a “big-A Anthropocene.”
“There are lots of important changes that humans have made, and they come in at lots of times and lots of places,” Ruddiman said.
The current geological time period, the Holocene Epoch, has lasted for 12,000 years. If Wolfe is right, and we’re just 70 years into the Anthropocene Epoch, then we’re really just starting to see what the consequences of human activities will look like for the planet.
“It’s really just the beginning,” he said.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Toronto Star,04-14-2015,http://www.thestar.com/life/technology/2015/04/14/has-earth-entered-the-anthropocene-epoch.html,11-26-2015
0,"In Hollywood, It’s a Reboot by Any Other Name","To Hollywood, “reboot” is a four-letter word.

Or, at least, it appears that way when filmmakers and stars alike bend over backward to describe their projects as anything other than a “reboot.” Instead, they use words like “revisit” and “reimagining.” The movie site Indiewire even argued for “rebirth.”

An exception that proves this rule is the team behind the new “Vacation” movie: The writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein view reboot as a fairly innocent term; “remake” was the label they feared.

“That was definitely a word that we have tried to be very clear that we are not,” Mr. Goldstein said in a phone interview. “This is not trying to replicate or do over what Chevy Chase did in 1983.”

Mr. Daley added, “As long as it’s really funny, people aren’t going to be quite as concerned with the technical aspects of whether or not it’s a reboot, remake or sequel.”

In the film, due July 29, Ed Helms plays a grown-up Rusty Griswold, who, like his father before him, attempts a wholesome family road trip to the Walley World theme park, but shenanigans confound his good intentions at every turn.

The “Vacation” franchise is particularly well-suited for a reboot given its own wink-and-nod casting history for the Griswold children. The heads of the family were always played by Mr. Chase and Beverly D’Angelo, a thread that continues with the new film. But the role of Rusty has been played by a different actor with each entry: Anthony Michael Hall in “National Lampoon’s Vacation” (1983), Jason Lively in “European Vacation” (1985), Johnny Galecki in “Christmas Vacation” (1989) and Ethan Embry in “Vegas Vacation” (1997).

This turnover provided some creative leeway for Mr. Daley and Mr. Goldstein. No fan could cry foul at continuing the Griswold story while also recasting the characters, because it’s already been done. Their film is essentially both a sequel and a reboot.

Still, Mr. Daley and Mr. Goldstein pre-emptively addressed any audience skepticism:

“We made sure to include a slightly meta-conversation that Rusty has with the Griswolds where he assures them that this is going to be different from the original ‘Vacation,’ ” Mr. Daley said.

Mr. Goldstein thought of it as a conversation with the audience. “We know what you’re thinking, but give us a chance.”

Reboot, remake, revisit. In the end, is there a difference? Perhaps this handy guide will help you parse the jargon (or just increase the debate).

THE SEQUEL

Definition: If the last film was a financial success, don’t rock the boat. Add a number/letter/subtitle on the end of the original title to suggest this one is bigger and better.

Examples: “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Magic Mike XXL,” “Pitch Perfect 2” and, due July 31, “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation.”

THE REMAKE

Definition: Telling the exact same story as the original, with modern gadgets.

Example: “Poltergeist.”

THE REBOOT

Definition: Trying to recapture the glory of a dormant franchise.

Example: “Vacation.”

THE REVISIT

Definition: It’s really the same thing as a reboot.

Example(s): “Mad Max: Fury Road.” While promoting the film earlier this year, the director George Miller and the star Tom Hardy insisted it be called a revisit.

THE REIMAGINING

Definition: Acknowledges only the cherished entries in the franchise and ignores the others.

Examples: According to David Ellison, the producer of the recent “Terminator: Genisys,” it “is not a remake, it’s not a reboot, it’s not a sequel — it’s really a reimagining based on the Cameron source material.” Best that we all forget “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines” (2003) and “Terminator Salvation” (2009).

“Jurassic World” also falls in this category. Even as early as the fall of 2013, the director Colin Trevorrow hesitated to use the word “reboot” while also saying goodbye to continuity from “The Lost World” (1997) and “Jurassic Park III (2001).”

THE RESET

Definition: New cast, same origin story. Needed when the previous entry is perceived to have failed creatively or financially. Skating by on brand recognition.

Examples: “Fantastic Four” (due in August) and “The Transporter Refueled” (set for September).

THE REVISE

Definition: Altering the continuity order of a franchise, to the edge of all logical sense.

Examples: The “Fast and the Furious” films. “Fast & Furious” (2009), “Fast Five” (2011) and “Fast & Furious 6” (2013) all take place before the events in “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift” (which came out in 2006 and was the third film in the series). But “Furious 7,” which came out in April, takes places afterward. Not confusing at all.",Soft News,Entertainment,New York Times,07-22-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/movies/in-hollywood-its-a-reboot-by-any-other-name.html,11-29-2015
0,Selena Gomez Tilts the Disney Halo With ‘Revival’,"LOS ANGELES — Selena Gomez wanted to control the music.

“Do you have an auxiliary cord?” the grown-up tween idol asked her driver on a recent Monday afternoon, queuing up a Spotify playlist (“It’s kind of all over the place”) and reaching into the front seat to crank the volume on a Christian rock song. One Direction, Nicki Minaj and the indie group Chromatics followed.

Ms. Gomez, like seemingly every other 23-year-old in the country, scrolled inattentively through Instagram and agreed to order sushi via an app as she rapped along to Drake under her breath (“Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers …”).

If she hadn’t recalled her stint, at the age of 7, on “Barney & Friends,” it was almost possible to forget Ms. Gomez’s child star bona fides: four seasons of a popular Disney show, “Wizards of Waverly Place”; four studio albums under the company’s music arm, Hollywood Records; and a soul-draining teen romance saga with Justin Bieber. But that’s all in her past now — sort of.

In an attempt to declare her rebirth as an independent, confident adult woman, Ms. Gomez will release “Revival,” her first album for Interscope, on Oct. 9. Yet while the music’s thematic awakenings (personal, professional, sexual) are meant to supplant her previous personas — tidily packaged goody-goody in her work, baby bird with broken wings in the tabloids — the songs are also savvily exploiting those same public stories and preconceptions.

As Ms. Gomez sings on the album’s opener: “What I’ve learned is so vital/More than just survival/This is my revival.”

The risk, however, is getting bogged down in past associations that threaten to eclipse her obvious growth as a performer. So Ms. Gomez must mine her experiences while trying to avoid a pop star identity that’s only refracted through others, be it Mr. Bieber or Taylor Swift, her longtime industry BFF who also sought in recent years to own the ugly chatter about her relationships with a new sense of agency and emphasis on female friendship.

The run-up to the album had to be carefully considered: The lead single, “Good for You,” featuring a sly verse from ASAP Rocky, is a statement of self-worth and sexual power as breathy come-on, conjuring none of Ms. Gomez’s ghosts. Only after its unexpected summer success — the mid-tempo song recently hit No. 1 on Billboard’s pop chart and landed at No. 5 on the Hot 100 — did Interscope release the more obvious single “Same Old Love,” a defiant but wounded kiss-off about a trampled heart.

When that was set to begin the campaign, “I was like, that’s not right,” Ms. Gomez said. “That’s not going to be my narrative. Not right now.”

While she plans to address her past, she is hyper-aware of how she has been perceived. “It’s all part of my story,” Ms. Gomez said while not quite relaxing in a Beverly Hills hotel suite before boarding the S.U.V. to rehearsal. “I’m growing and changing. I was in a relationship, and I was being managed by my parents, and I was still under Hollywood and Disney, and I was being held to this expectation of being the good girl.”

She continued: “I knew deep down that this wasn’t what I wanted to do — being exhausted of forcing something that wasn’t right, even in my personal life. I had to have moments where I was crying and I was like, ‘Why am I not in love with what I do?’ I was forced to get very uncomfortable for a while in order to make the decisions I made.”

Even more liberating than leaving Disney, Ms. Gomez said, was letting her mother go as a manager last year, an experience she called “very awkward” and likened to “a kid going to college.” But suddenly decisions like posing almost naked on the cover of “Revival” became easier, she said.

Poised without seeming robotic, Ms. Gomez can also be a ball of nerves, making her perhaps the most earthbound of her generation’s Disney graduates (Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato). She said she is prone to overthinking, endures episodes of “angst” and is extra-sensitive to uncomfortable situations. (“Had major anxiety at the airport,” she tweeted recently to more than 32 million followers. “Not feeling good at all.”)

Years of paparazzi attention and interest in her barely pubescent love life contributed to the guarded uneasiness just under her shimmery surface. Ms. Gomez recalled thinking: “I need my work to just outshine all of this because the noise is driving me crazy, and it’s preventing me from leaving my home. When I walk into a place and people look at me, they don’t see an artist.”

Still, she took to a new path tentatively. Rather than shattering her Disney halo and leaving loyal fans, known as “Selenators,” behind, Ms. Gomez matured in fits and starts, always referencing her past eras.

In 2013, she starred in Harmony Korine’s “Spring Breakers,” a neon Florida fever dream of guns, sex and binge drinking, but she played Faith, the corrupted church girl with cherub cheeks and quivering lips, who runs away before things get truly deranged.

Her mother brought her the raunchy script. “She was like, ‘It’s the last season of ‘Wizards,’ and no one will hear about it — it’ll be underground and give you a lot of street cred,’ Ms. Gomez remembered. She laughed. “That’s not what happened.”

Hang-wringing over her role in the film erupted instantly. “I had this weird moment where I was at the Toronto Film Festival, and during the day I premiered ‘Hotel Transylvania’ ” — an animated film, rated PG — “then at night I premiered ‘Spring Breakers,’ ” she said. “Of course there was controversy: ‘Oh, she’s in a bikini, and she’s a role model.”

But the adult part played just enough against type, putting Ms. Gomez on new industry radars, including that of John Janick, now the chairman and chief executive of Interscope. “I thought it was the perfect thing for her to do,” he said of “Spring Breakers” — “a natural progression” without “completely abandoning what she came from.”

After Mr. Janick popped into a recording session to meet Ms. Gomez in 2013, the pair started a year of discussions about taking her music career in a similar direction. “It was always about empowering her the right way, but making sure you’re not jumping 10 steps ahead,” he said. Ms. Gomez’s album “Stars Dance,” released the same year by Hollywood, was another baby step toward an adult career and featured the Top 10 hit “Come & Get It,” her biggest song to date.

Before signing with Interscope in December 2014, Ms. Gomez took a bigger stride toward independence with a final, contract-fulfilling single for Disney. “The Heart Wants What It Wants” begins with a tearful monologue and addresses her relationship with Mr. Bieber all but explicitly.

“My public life was doing all the speaking for me, for a moment,” Ms. Gomez said. While the gossip press “made it their mission to make me seem meek and small,” she added, “I translated that into my music.”

Her openness carried over to sessions for “Revival.” Along with producers and songwriters of the moment (the Max Martin acolytes Mattman & Robin, Hit-Boy, Benny Blanco), Ms. Gomez, who is listed as executive producer and has writing credits on six songs, worked with a slew of young women, including Charli XCX (“Same Old Love”), Julia Michaels (“Revival,” “Good for You”) and Chloe Angelides (the is-it-Bieber anthem “Sober”).

Justin Tranter, another “Revival” songwriter, said that Ms. Gomez was realistic about playing into the gossip. “Those questions do come up while writing,” he said. “Of course we don’t want everything to feel like it’s feeding into the tabloids, but also we need the song to win. She’s smart enough to know that.”

The release of “Revival” happens to coincide, for better or worse, with the re-emergence of a humbled Mr. Bieber, who faces a similar dilemma with a new album due Nov. 13. Asked recently by Ellen DeGeneres if his new single, “What Do You Mean?,” is about Ms. Gomez, he could only fidget and grimace. (Mr. Janick acknowledged the promotional overlap but added, “We’re not exploiting it in any way.”)

While avoiding speaking Mr. Bieber’s name, Ms. Gomez said she was heartened by their parallel successes. “While people were writing that I was stupid for being in it, this is what I always saw in him,” she said. “I’m like, duh!”

Ms. Gomez is careful now to balance her camera-ready self with a more low-key version. Last month, she gamely posed with Ms. Swift’s girl gang of models and actresses at the MTV Video Music Awards. “Taylor is a lot more trusting than I am,” she said. “I have trust issues, given my situation. She’s very open, so she brings out this other side of me.” But after a night among starlets, Ms. Gomez returned home to the celebrity suburb of Calabasas, to eat cookies with her two roommates (a realtor and a nonprofit employee.)

“In the last two years, I’ve seen Selena start to make her career her own,” Ms. Swift said. “She’s separated her opinion out and prioritized it above anyone else’s. Her childhood was defined by working hard, with the major business decisions primarily being made by others. The coolest part of watching her grow up has been seeing her gradually take the creative reins and start to steer the ship.”

Ms. Gomez said she’s getting used to the autonomy. “I definitely remind myself that I’m in control,” she said. “I feel like ultimately if I sit down and I think about a decision I need to make, it’s really within myself. I make the decision. Everything goes through me.”",Soft News,Entertainment,New York Times,09-24-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/arts/music/selena-gomez-tilts-the-disney-halo-with-revival.html,11-29-2015
0,"‘Goodfellas,’ 25 Years On: Cast Members Reminisce","It’s been 25 years since Martin Scorsese’s seminal gangster film “Goodfellas” opened to the adulation of critics, among them Vincent Canby of The New York Times, who hailed it as “breathless and brilliant.” Though it’s now considered a classic, counted by the American Film Institute as one of the country’s 100 greatest films, its foul-mouthed tale of the rise and fall of the murderous Henry Hill; his wife, Karen; and his patron, Paulie, left early audiences cold. In a nod to the anniversary, Film Forum is screening a newly restored version of the movie starting next Friday.

Several of the film’s principals recently talked about their recollections of the production, including Nicholas Pileggi, who adapted the screenplay with Mr. Scorsese from Mr. Pileggi’s nonfiction best seller “Wiseguy.” Here are excerpts from those conversations.

Nicholas Pileggi I was still working at New York magazine when “Wiseguy” came out. David Denby was doing reviews. And I got a message at the magazine that Marty Scorsese called. I knew it was Denby, and I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction. Then Nora — I was married to Nora Ephron — said: “Are you crazy? Why won’t you talk to Marty Scorsese? He’s been trying to reach you, and you wouldn’t call him back?” He was in production with the same people who had worked on Nora’s movie. So I called Marty right away, and we got going. I just knew Marty was the guy to do it, no question about it. I’d go to his office. I’d do the typing, because he couldn’t type.

Ray Liotta (who played Henry Hill): I was on the second floor of the Excelsior Hotel [at the Venice Film Festival]. I looked down, and there was all this commotion and in the middle of it was Marty. He was there with “The Last Temptation of Christ.” I guess he was getting a lot of death threats. I beelined down there. He was surrounded by bodyguards. I started walking toward him. All the bodyguards pushed me off. I just want to say hi to Marty. I think my initial reaction was, “Get your hands off me,” acting like a tough guy, which I’m not. He said that’s when he knew.

Paul Sorvino (Paulie): I would have done a “Dinner is served” role in a Scorsese picture, that’s how much I wanted to work with him. I met with him and saw immediately he wanted me for the role. I was overjoyed but very worried. I’d done a lot of comedies as well as dramas, but I’d never done a really tough guy. I never had it in me. And this called for a lethality, which I felt was way beyond me. I called my manager three days before we started shooting and said: “Get me out. I’m going to ruin this great man’s picture, and I’m going to ruin myself.” He, being wise, said, “Call me tomorrow, and if necessary I will get you out.”

Then I was going by the hall mirror to adjust my tie. I was just inconsolable. And I looked in the mirror and literally jumped back a foot. I saw a look I’d never seen, something in my eyes that alarmed me. A deadly soulless look in my eyes that scared me and was overwhelmingly threatening. And I looked to the heavens and said, “You’ve found it.”

Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill): I had read for him before for [the 1985 comedy] “After Hours.” Marty called me after that audition and said, “I think you’re great — I’m not going to give you this part, but I know we’re going to work together.” I hung up and said, “Yeah, he says that to every actor when they don’t get a part.” I was proven very wrong.

Liotta Nick gave me all the cassettes that he had of Henry talking, and I listened to them all the time. I would put the cassette in the car and listen. The most annoying part of it was [Hill’s] constantly eating potato chips through the whole thing. He didn’t care if it bothered Nick. I was listening for hours to this [guy] chomping potato chips. Of him casually telling Nick, “Oh yeah, that’s when Tommy whacked so and so.” It was disgusting. Horrible.

Pileggi I went to the set for a little bit, then I got bored. There was nothing for me to do. You know what kills me? It takes forever to change lighting. Twenty minutes, a half-hour, 45 minutes. I don’t know where Marty gets the patience.

Bracco [On the scene in which Karen pins Henry on the floor and points a gun at him, which was her most difficult.] Basically I had to straddle Mike Ballhaus, who was our director of photography, and not Ray. And Marty had Ray and I, basically we kind of had to talk into the camera. We could see the reflection of ourselves in the camera, and that was weird. Marty told us it was going to be hard. He begged us to take our time.

Liotta The whole thing was tempered by my mom, who was sick and had cancer and died in the middle of it. I was going home every weekend to New Jersey. Then one day I got a specific “You need to get home.” Marty told me, and my knees buckled. I finished the scene, went home, buried her and was back to work three, four days later. And the first scene after the funeral was after I stand Karen up and she says, “Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli?” And I’m kind of laughing. That’s one of the great things about acting. Between action and cut, you can really lose yourself and do what needs to be done.

Pileggi You know that scene where Mrs. Scorsese [the director’s mother, who plays the mother of a gangster] is talking about how she’s taken up painting? My mother was taking up painting. One of the pictures my mother did was this guy in a boat with one dog looking one way, the other looking the other. So my mother’s picture ends up in movie. The last credit in the movie is “Painting by Susan Pileggi.” She referred to the movie until she died as “my movie.”

Sorvino After production, I felt guilty about it for about six months. My image of myself is artist, painter, poet, sculptor, thinker, author. What am I really? Am I a killer? It bothered me. It unsettled me. Then I came to the conclusion, I rationalized, if this isn’t in all of us, how does the military of any country inculcate a killing drive into soldiers, to go confront people [toward] which they have no natural animus and kill them? I was in the Army, I know it’s possible. They dig that out of you. That’s how I got out of it.

Pileggi I loved it as a movie, I was delighted. I was sad to hear from [Irwin Winkler, the producer] that at a screening in Southern California — well, the number varies. Irwin thinks it was 31 who walked out. Marty said 71. I guess it was violent. More than the violence, it was the language, I think it put people off. It was very disappointing. Then the movie reviews came in, which were phenomenal, and it slowly began to build.

Bracco I can’t go somewhere without someone screaming, “Karen!” Twenty-five years later people still yell, “Karen!”

Sorvino I get a lot of “Hey, Paulie!” every day. It’s a little rankling. I didn’t want that to be my legacy. Later on, I made my peace with it. I’m tremendously proud that I was part of it.",Soft News,Entertainment,New York Times,06-12-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/movies/goodfellas-25-years-on-cast-members-reminisce.html,11-29-2015
0,"Bill Cosby, in Deposition, Said Drugs and Fame Helped Him Seduce Women","He was not above seducing a young model by showing interest in her father’s cancer. He promised other women his mentorship and career advice before pushing them for sex acts. And he tried to use financial sleight of hand to keep his wife from finding out about his serial philandering.

Bill Cosby admitted to all of this and more over four days of intense questioning 10 years ago at a Philadelphia hotel, where he defended himself in a deposition for a lawsuit filed by a young woman who accused him of drugging and molesting her.

Even as Mr. Cosby denied he was a sexual predator who assaulted many women, he presented himself in the deposition as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women — a profile at odds with the popular image he so long enjoyed, that of father figure and public moralist.

In the deposition, which Mr. Cosby has for years managed to keep private but was obtained by The New York Times, the entertainer comes across as alternately annoyed, mocking, occasionally charming and sometimes boastful, often blithely describing sexual encounters in graphic detail.

He talked of the 19-year-old aspiring model who sent him her poem and ended up on his sofa, where, Mr. Cosby said, she pleasured him with lotion.

He spoke with casual disregard about ending a relationship with another model so he could pursue other women. “Moving on,” was his phrase.

He suggested he was skilled in picking up the nonverbal cues that signal a woman’s consent.

“I think I’m a pretty decent reader of people and their emotions in these romantic sexual things, whatever you want to call them,” he said.

Through it all, his manner was largely one of casual indifference.

At one point in the first day of questioning, Dolores M. Troiani, the lawyer for the plaintiff in the case, Andrea Constand, a young woman who worked at Temple University as a basketball manager, seemed struck by Mr. Cosby’s jocular manner.

“I think you’re making light of a very serious situation,” she said, to which Mr. Cosby replied: “That may very well be.”

Interest in Mr. Cosby’s deposition grew this month when a federal judge unsealed a 62-page memorandum of law in the case, which had been settled in 2006. The memorandum contained excerpts from the deposition, including Mr. Cosby’s acknowledgment that he had obtained quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women.

The parties have been prohibited from releasing the memorandum because of a confidentiality clause that was part of the settlement agreement, but the deposition itself was never sealed. This month, Ms. Constand’s lawyer asked the court to lift the confidentiality clause so her client would be free to release the nearly 1,000-page deposition transcript. The Times later learned that the transcript was already publicly available through a court reporting service.

Mr. Cosby has never been charged with a crime and has repeatedly denied the accusations of sexual assault, now leveled by dozens of women. David Brokaw, Mr. Cosby’s publicist, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Ms. Troiani declined to comment. In three suits, women who accused Mr. Cosby of sexual misconduct are pursuing civil claims against him. In addition, the Los Angeles police have said they are reviewing a complaint of a sexual nature against Mr. Cosby.

While Mr. Cosby described encounters with many women through the course of his deposition, it is through his long and detailed descriptions of his relationship with Ms. Constand, who is much younger, that Mr. Cosby’s attitudes, proclivities and approach to women are most clearly revealed. Ms. Constand was present for at least some of Mr. Cosby’s testimony in the Rittenhouse Hotel in Philadelphia.

First spotting her at Temple University in the early 2000s, Mr. Cosby said he felt romantic interest immediately (“She’s good-looking”), and began a relationship that led, in his telling, to dinners and more.

Asked how he wooed her, Mr. Cosby, who has been married since 1964, responded: “Inviting her to my house, talking to her about personal situations dealing with her life, growth, education.”

He painted his relationship with Ms. Constand as one of mentor and mentee, casting himself in the role of an experienced guide and offering her the benefit of his contacts, fame and experience.

At times he described becoming frustrated after Ms. Constand failed to follow his advice, such as when he wanted her to pursue her interest in sports broadcasting by calling someone and she did not. “Here’s a mentor, Bill Cosby, who is in the business, Bill Cosby, who happens to know something about what to do and Andrea is not picking up on it,” he said.

Ms. Constand ultimately went to the police to complain of Mr. Cosby’s behavior, but in his telling, his seduction was one of persistence and patience.

Early on in his courtship, he arranged an intimate meal alone with her at his Pennsylvania home, complete with Cognac, dimmed lights and a fire, he said. At one point he led her to his back porch, out of sight from his chef. “I take her hair and I pull it back and I have her face like this,” he said. “And I’m talking to her ...And I talked to her about relaxing, being strong. And I said to her, come in, meaning her body.”

But the two remained inches apart, he said, and he did not try to kiss her because he did not sense she wanted him to. Nevertheless, at the next dinner he said they had what he described as a “sexual moment,” short of intercourse. He described her afterward as having “a glow.”

Expounding on his philosophy about sex, Mr. Cosby said he tended to refrain from intercourse because he did not want women to fall in love with him. To him, he said, the act of sexual intercourse “is something that I feel the woman will succumb to more of a romance and more of a feeling, not love, but it’s deeper than a playful situation.” As far as he and Ms. Constand went, he said, they were “playing sex, we’re playing, petting, we’re playing.”

Was he in love with her? “No.”

Yet the association endured for a few years, until one night at his Pennsylvania home, when Ms. Constand said Mr. Cosby drugged and molested her.

Mr. Cosby said he gave her one and a half tablets of Benadryl to relieve stress, they kissed and had sexual contact. Her lawyer said she believed it was a much more powerful drug.

Some time later, after Ms. Constand had moved home to Canada, Mr. Cosby spoke with Ms. Constand’s mother on the telephone. The mother, he said, was upset about what her daughter said Mr. Cosby had done, describing the experience as “a mother’s nightmare.”

In the deposition, he said he was worried that Ms. Constand’s mother would think of him as a “dirty old man.”

During the call, Mr. Cosby told the deposing lawyers, he wanted Ms. Constand to tell her mother “about the orgasm” so that she would realize it was consensual.

“Tell your mother about the orgasm. Tell your mother how we talked,” he said he remembered thinking.

Subsequently, concerned that Ms. Constand and her mother might seek to embarrass him, he said he offered to help pay for Ms. Constand’s further education. Years earlier, he offered to reward another woman, Therese Serignese, whom he had met at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1976, with money as a bonus for good grades.

It is difficult to say to what extent Mr. Cosby’s wife, Camille, was aware of her husband’s womanizing, though it was certainly clear to her by 1997, when Mr. Cosby acknowledged an affair. Mrs. Cosby suggested at the time that there had been marital problems but they had put them behind them.

Still, in the deposition, Mr. Cosby, 78, described going to some lengths to hide his behavior, blocking a magazine article to avoid publicity and funneling money to one woman through his agent so “Mrs. Cosby” wouldn’t find out.

In the case of Ms. Constand, who never sought any funds, Mr. Cosby said he imagined his wife would have known he was helping with her education. But, he said, “My wife would not know it was because Andrea and I had had sex and that Andrea was now very, very upset and that she decided that she would like to go to school.”

While Mr. Cosby insisted the only drug he had given Ms. Constand was Benadryl, he was open about his access in the 1970s to quaaludes, a sedative also popular as a party drug.

He said he obtained seven prescriptions for them over two to three years from a doctor in Los Angeles, ostensibly for a sore back but in reality to give to women.

He admitted to giving young women quaaludes at that time “the same as a person would say have a drink,” he said, but not without their knowledge.

Though he portrayed the drug-taking and sex as consensual, Mr. Cosby — when asked whether Ms. Serignese was in a position to consent to sexual intercourse after he gave her quaaludes in 1976 — said: “I don’t know.”

Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for Ms. Serignese and two other women who are suing Mr. Cosby for defamation, said of the deposition: “This information is important because it sheds light on the private practices of a man who holds himself out as a public moralist.”

During the questioning, Mr. Cosby cast himself as a sensitive and attentive supporter of Ms. Constand, though his tone changed when addressing Ms. Constand in the present tense.

Asked by Ms. Constand’s lawyer about how he felt when Ms. Constand cried during her own deposition, Mr. Cosby was unsparing: “I think Andrea is a liar and I know she’s a liar because I was there. I was there.”

And he could be dispassionate in recalling former relationships. With a woman named Beth Ferrier, a model he met in the 1980s, he recalled inquiring after her career and her father, who had died of cancer.

“Did you ask her those questions because you wanted to have sexual contact with her?” Ms. Troiani asked.

“Yes,” Mr. Cosby responded.

Still, he said he viewed himself as a good person, worthy of trust, and chivalrous in his desire to never tell others about the women with whom he had sex.

“I am a man, the only way you will hear about who I had sex with is from the person I had it with,” he said.

In some passages, Mr. Cosby offered a glimpse into a life long insulated by perks and wealth. Some idiosyncrasies are revealed, like his penchant for sweatpants (he had at least 100, he said), how he used the name Seymour Rapaport as an alias in the 1970s and 1980s when he traveled, and how many of his employees signed confidentiality agreements.

In the deposition, Mr. Cosby described sexual liaisons — he sometimes calls them rendezvous — with at least five women, and having a “romantic” interest in two more, in locations like Denver, Las Vegas and New York and Pennsylvania, in hotels or in one of his homes.

In the court case, 13 women came forward with anonymous sworn statements to support Ms. Constand, saying that they, too, had been molested in some way by Mr. Cosby. But they never had a chance to pursue their claims in court because, six months after the fourth and final day of his deposition, Mr. Cosby settled the case with Ms. Constand on undisclosed terms. His deposition was filed away, another document in a settled court case, until now",Soft News,Entertainment,New York Times,07-18-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/arts/bill-cosby-deposition-reveals-calculated-pursuit-of-young-women-using-fame-drugs-and-deceit.html,11-29-2015
0,"Oscars 2015: Passionate Speeches, but Few Surprises","“Life is full of surprises,” is how Pawel Pawlikowski, the Polish-born director of “Ida,” put it at the Oscars on Sunday night. And he was one of them. Mr. Pawlikowski managed to keep talking over the wrap-it-up music, which usually ushers off long-winded or lesser-known nominees, and actually finished his acceptance speech for best foreign language film.

There weren’t too many other surprises.

One of the less predictable turn of events was the bland performance by Neil Patrick Harris, a veteran M.C. of both the Tony Awards and the Emmys, who hosted the Oscars for the first time on Sunday. His one successful stretch was a parody of a scene from “Birdman,” in which Michael Keaton runs through Times Square in his underpants. Mr. Harris ran through backstage corridors and onto the stage in white briefs and his black socks and shoes. But because Mr. Harris is in good physical shape, there wasn’t much humor or bravery to the sketch, just bravado.

Oscar nights almost always drag on too long, but this one was a slog almost from the very beginning. Mr. Harris dutifully did a song tribute to old Hollywood, and Jack Black ran up on stage to express the self-loathing of new Hollywood, ranting about an “industry in flux,” big budget movies about superheroes and formulaic scripts.

That may have been a reaction to the best picture nominations — seven of the eight are not big studio films, but independent movies that found a niche audience. None of them made nearly as much money as “American Sniper” (or for that matter, “The Lego Movie”).

There were some moments that went against the usual Oscar formula of tears and gratitude. Patricia Arquette’s feminist call to arms at the end of her acceptance speech for supporting actress was unexpected and fierce. “We have fought for everybody else’s equal rights. It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America,” she said as Meryl Streep and others roared their approval.

“Citizenfour,” about the National Security Agency leaker Edward J. Snowden, won best documentary, and its makers thanked Mr. Snowden, who is still in Russia, for his courage. Mr. Harris joked that Mr. Snowden “couldn’t be here for some treason.”

Oscar nights usually do have their share of political posturing, but this was a particularly passionate evening.

This year, in addition to Ms. Arquette’s speech, the question of race in Hollywood was addressed with both humor — in his opening monologue, Mr. Harris made a barbed allusion to the lack of diversity among the Academy by saying, “Tonight we honor Hollywood’s best and whitest, sorry, brightest” — and emotion. The latter came at the hands of actors, musicians and others who wanted to express indignation that the director of “Selma,” Ava DuVernay, wasn’t nominated and neither was David Oyelowo, who played the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. When the audience applauded Mr. Oyelowo, who participated in a bit with Mr. Harris, the host said with a smirk, “Oh sure, now you like him.”

As John Legend and Common accepted the Oscar for their song, “Glory,” from “Selma,” Mr. Legend urged the audience to join the struggle to protect voting rights and called the United States “the most incarcerated country in the world,” saying that there are now more “black men under correctional control than were under slavery in 1850.”

The political speeches were somber, but they turned out to be more lively and bracing than any of Mr. Harris’s skits.",Soft News,Entertainment,New York Times,02-23-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/movies/awardsseason/oscars-2015-passionate-speeches-but-few-surprises.html,11-29-2015
0,Bill Cosby admits obtaining Quaaludes to sedate sexual targets,"PHILADELPHIA—Bill Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave the sedative to at least one woman and “other people,” according to documents obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
That woman and a second woman testified in the same case that they knowingly took Quaaludes from him, according to the unsealed documents.
Cosby’s admission could bolster defamation claims by his accusers, the women’s lawyers said.
“If today’s report is true, Mr. Cosby admitted under oath 10 years ago sedating women for sexual purposes,” said Lisa Bloom, attorney for model Janice Dickinson, who contends she was drugged and raped. “Given that, how dare he publicly vilify Ms. Dickinson and accuse her of lying when she tells a very similar story?”
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the documents from the deposition in a sexual abuse lawsuit filed by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand, the first of a cascade of sexual abuse lawsuits against him. Cosby’s lawyers had objected on the grounds that it would embarrass their client.
Cosby settled that lawsuit under confidential terms in 2006. His lawyers in the Philadelphia case did not immediately return phone calls Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer said Monday.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them in incidents dating back more than four decades. Cosby has never been criminally charged, and most of the accusations are barred by statutes of limitations.
Cosby, giving sworn testimony in the lawsuit accusing him of sexual assaulting Constand in his home in Pennsylvania in 2005, said he acquired seven Quaalude prescriptions in the 1970s. The lawyer for Constand asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s — after they were banned — but was frustrated by objections from Cosby’s lawyer.
“When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?” lawyer Dolores Troiani asked.
“Yes,” Cosby answered on Sept. 29, 2005.
“Did you ever give any of these young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge?”
Cosby’s lawyer again objected, leading Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to co-operate.
Cosby later said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl, although in the documents Troiani voices doubt that that was the drug involved. The two other women who testified on Constand’s behalf said they knowingly took Quaaludes from Cosby.
Three of the women accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them have a defamation lawsuit pending against him in Massachusetts. They allege that he defamed them when his agents said their accusations were untrue. Cosby is trying to get their case thrown out before discovery.
Cosby had fought the AP’s efforts to unseal the testimony, with his lawyer arguing the deposition could reveal details of Cosby’s marriage, sex life and prescription drug use.
“It would be terribly embarrassing for this material to come out,” lawyer George Gowen argued in June. He said the public should not have access to what Cosby was forced to say as he answered questions under oath from the accuser’s lawyer nearly a decade ago.
“Frankly . . . it would embarrass him, (and) it would also prejudice him in the eyes of the jury pool in Massachusetts,” Gowen said.
U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno asked last month why Cosby was fighting the release of his sworn testimony, given that the accusations in the Temple woman’s lawsuit were already in the public eye.
“Why would he be embarrassed by his own version of the facts?” Robreno said.
Cosby resigned in December from the board of trustees at Temple, where he had been the popular face of the Philadelphia university in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and commencement speeches.",Soft News,Entertainment,Toronto Star,07-06-2015,http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2015/07/06/bill-cosby-admitted-getting-quaaludes-to-sedate-sexual-targets.html,11-29-2015
0,Kate Middleton at hospital as Royals fans await birth,"The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to hospital in central London to give birth to her second child, who will be fourth in line to the British throne.
The duchess, the former Kate Middleton, was driven to St. Mary’s Hospital in the Paddington district of the capital along with her husband Prince William early on Saturday, Kensington Palace said in a statement.
It’s the same hospital where the duchess, 33, gave birth to the couple’s first baby, Prince George, in July 2013. William’s father, Prince Charles, is the heir apparent to Queen Elizabeth II, who has been monarch since 1952. William and George are next in line.
“Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted at 06:00 to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London and is in the early stages of labour,” the palace said. She traveled by car from the palace with William, it added.
As with her first child, the duchess will be cared for in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s—a private medical facility within a hospital that’s part of Britain’s state-funded National Health Service.
“Discretion is key to our service, and we will ensure that you have the space, security and privacy you need to enjoy these precious early moments as a family,” the hospital says on the website advertising the private maternity wing. It charges $7,800 (U.S.) for a standard delivery for the first 24 hours of care.
The announcement that the royal birth is imminent is likely to distract from media coverage of the campaign for Britain’s general election on May 7. The wait for the birth of Prince George saw television stations from around the world broadcasting live around the clock from St. Mary’s.
As in her first pregnancy, the duchess suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, or very acute morning sickness. She continued with official royal engagements until late March.

0,Vinyl Café Christmas Tour cancelled after host diagnosed with melanoma,"Vinyl Café host Stuart McLean has cancelled the rest of his Christmas tour after being diagnosed with melanoma.
In an update posted on both the popular CBC radio program’s Facebook page and website Saturday morning, McLean wrote that he just learned about his melanoma, a type of skin cancer, and will be starting treatment next week.
As a result, shows scheduled for Nov. 23 onwards will be cancelled.
“I know this is a disappointment to those of you who are looking forward to the show,” McLean wrote. “It is a disappointment to me too. It feels like I invited everyone to dinner and am calling to say the party’s off. I don’t know what to say except, I am sorry.”
He noted that the diagnosis is “not quite as ominous as it sounds” and that his doctor said the positive outcome of treatment he will be receiving “should be in the neighbourhood of 85 per cent.”
“We wondered about the option of doing both — the tour and the therapy — but there is the possibility of side effects from the treatment and I don’t want to be doing shows if I can’t be my best self,” McLean wrote. “Nor do I want to be doing therapy if I can’t bring my best self there.”
The Vinyl Café, written and hosted by McLean, is broadcast three times weekly on CBC Radio and certain public radio stations in the U.S. The show, recorded in front of live audiences across Canada, is often humorous and features music and McLean’s stories about a character named Dave, the owner of a second-hand record store, his wife Morley and their children, Sam and Stephanie. McLean also includes anecdotes and observations about the venue and city he is recording in.
The Christmas Tour was scheduled to take McLean across Canada and the U.S., and now-cancelled stops include Toronto, Hamilton, Vancouver and Calgary. McLean’s last show on the tour will be on Thunder Bay on Sunday. Ticket refunds for cancelled shows will be available starting Nov. 24 at the point of purchase.
Although apologetic, McLean was also optimistic about the outcome of the situation.
“I expect we will be able to reconvene next Christmas, as we would have this year had it not been for my extraordinarily bad timing,” he said.
And by then, he should have some new stories about Dave and Morley to tell.",Soft News,Entertainment,Toronto Star,11-21-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/21/vinyl-caf-christmas-tour-cancelled-after-host-diagnosed-with-melanoma.html,11-29-2015

Jenner — known more as part of television’s Kardashian family — poses for celeb photographer Annie Leibovitz on the cover the magazine’s July issue in Jenner’s Malibu home.
In April, Jenner told ABC’s Diane Sawyer that he hoped speaking publicly about the gender issues would do some good in the world and vigorously denied that the interview was some sort of publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian reality TV show.
“If the Kardashian show gave me a foothold to do some good, I’m all for that,” Jenner said.
Jenner said he self-identifies as “her,” not a specific name. But he told Sawyer he felt comfortable using the pronouns “he” and “him,” a designation that is an important issue for many in the transgender community.
Jenner said he has never been sexually attracted to men, and he wanted to make clear to viewers that gender identity and sexuality were separate things.“I am not gay,” Jenner said. “I am, as far as I know, heterosexual.

0,China’s Stock Market Plunges,"SHANGHAI — Share prices in China plunged on Friday in one of the sharpest sell-offs in years, accelerating a downturn this last week in what has been, for much of this year, the world’s best-performing stock market.

China’s two major market indexes fell in tandem. The Shanghai composite fell 7.4 percent on Friday. The Shenzhen composite fell even more, dropping 7.9 percent. Share prices in Hong Kong, which is regulated separately, also fell, by 1.8 percent.

Analysts had been warning for months about the risks of a stock market bubble in China, where giddy investors have driven up stock prices by purchasing shares on margin, or with money borrowed from brokers.

China’s market has been an anomaly. Even though the broader Chinese economy has been relatively weak, share prices of many Chinese-listed companies have skyrocketed in the last year. Many traded at record valuations, often 80, 90 or 100 times their projected earnings.

The high valuations have been a boon for listed companies and their major shareholders. The market boom has also helped encourage a wave of Chinese companies that had listed in the United States to arrange stock buyouts and delist with the intention of eventually relisting in China, where stock valuations are much higher.

In the last few months, some well-known Chinese companies have announced plans to buy back shares and delist from the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, including Wuxi Pharma Tech, HomeInn Hotels and Qihoo 360, the Internet services provider, whose management offered $9 billion in a buyout.

But China’s roaring stock market showed in the week just past how volatile prices can be: Shenzhen’s main index fell the previous week, then rose early last week, then tumbled again.

Authorities are moving to tighten rules on buying stock with borrowed money, which is believed to be one of the key drivers of a stock market rally that has sent share prices to seven-year highs.

The regulators are also trying to crack down on financing from unregulated sources, what analysts refer to as over-the-counter stock margin financing.

“This is what triggered the correction,” said Steven Sun, a Hong Kong-based analyst for HSBC. “Also, there have been controlling shareholders, significant shareholders and corporate management trying to cash out. They had been selling massively into the rally. And these are people in a better position to know the performance of their company.”

Many analysts say that the government props up the stock market as a policy move aimed at helping debt-burdened state-owned companies repair their balance sheets. A strong market also improves the financing of private entrepreneurs, which could help spur innovation.

But the government has been careful to warn about some of the risks, including the use of borrowed money, knowing that a sharp decline could hurt smaller investors.

Analysts at some major banks, including HSBC and Morgan Stanley, have been cautioning investors about the risks of the market, particularly after a big sell-off last month. Although stock prices are still up significantly from a year ago, with the Shanghai composite reaching 5,166.35, up as much as 160 percent in the last two years, there are signs that some of the most sought-after stocks are now in the doldrums.

The Shanghai composite is down about 18 percent from its June high. But in Shenzhen, the so-called ChiNext, a kind of Nasdaq-style board on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange for growth stocks, has dropped about 30 percent in the last several weeks, meaning it is already technically in a bear market.

The FTSE in London fell nearly 0.8 percent on Friday; while the German DAX closed up 0.2 percent and the CAC in France rose 0.4 percent. United States indexes were mixed: The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and Nasdaq fell 0.6 percent.

Chi Lo, a senior economist covering greater China for BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said the Chinese government had promoted the growth of the stock market as a tool for financial reform, like reducing the economy’s reliance on bank lending. But he said the government grew concerned about margin lending, and that, combined with a steady stream of new companies listing their shares on the market, had led to a correction in prices.

“This is not a bad thing,” Mr. Lo said. “This is an opportunity for long-term investors to go back in. Many investors weren’t comfortable with those sky-high valuations.”",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,New York Times,06-26-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/business/international/chinese-stock-indexes-plunge.html?_r=0,01-03-2016
0,Wall Street Regulator Plans to Scrutinize Electronic Bond Trading,"Wall Street’s self-regulator plans to take a closer look at electronic trading in bonds this year, as part of an expanded review of fixed-income markets.

The regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, announced the initiative on Tuesday in a letter outlining its priorities for 2015. Among the plans, Finra said it would start conducting examinations of firms that offer electronic bond trading, as well as “books and records, supervision and order execution practices” in bonds.

Richard G. Ketchum, Finra’s chief executive, said the review was motivated by broad changes in the bond market. Partly in response to new regulations, bond dealers are holding less inventory, pushing more trading to various intermediaries, he said.

“I do think this is very much a year of fixed-income,” Mr. Ketchum said in an interview. “Sales practices and best execution in fixed-income are going to be a huge focus.”

In its review of bond trading, Finra said it would scrutinize whether firms are able to ensure they are achieving the best price for their customers. The regulator also said it was examining situations where bond intermediaries may have failed to disclose information about how they are charging customers.

When the regulator announced its priorities last year, it said it would seek to increase the visibility of its BrokerCheck website, which lets investors see whether a broker has a clean record.

That proposal has not yet been enacted. Finra is revising it, with plans to resubmit it to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,New York Times,01-06-2015,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/regulator-plans-to-scrutinize-electronic-bond-trading/,01-03-2016
0,"Reopening the Bank of Mom and Dad, to Help Adult Children","Cutting the financial cord with adult children can be hard to do.

Just ask Virginia Illiano, a substitute teacher who lives in Brooklyn. After her daughter graduated from an expensive private college, Ms. Illiano thought her days of paying big bills for her daughter were over.

She was wrong. Her daughter, who is in her 20s, was not able to find a good-paying job and ended up moving in with her mother. That was just the beginning. Ms. Illiano co-signed for a leased car, repaid some of her daughter’s credit card debt and even paid for her nails, vacations and some clothes.

“My teacher benefits are awesome, but she won’t have any of that,” said Ms. Illiano, 55, who is divorced. And that’s just fine with Ms. Illiano.

“I told my daughter to go for her dream,” she said, explaining that she wanted her “to have her financial legs.”

Ms. Illiano’s financial leg up for her daughter, however, has a downside. She is dipping into her own retirement funds, which means she is now looking at a couple of difficult choices: working longer or selling her home, which is already being used as collateral for her daughter’s student loan.

More older parents are facing challenges like Ms. Illiano’s. They are helping their adult children by dishing out loans or cash gifts, or paying bills. But this largess sometimes blows a big hole in their finances, even jeopardizing their retirement. As a result, some older adults are going back to work, reducing their own living expenses or even declaring bankruptcy.

While rigorous data is difficult to obtain, several reports suggest that the problems associated with supporting adult children are growing. At the same time, many baby boomers are far short of holding enough in their retirement accounts to support themselves into old age.

“Some adult children aren’t making enough money,” said Netiva Heard, a certified debt counselor at MNH Credit Solutions in Chicago. “So parents are taking over certain bills like credit cards, cellphones and rent.”

Parents, of course, want the best for their children from the moment they are born and are used to doing everything they can to help them. Continuing that support into adulthood has spread, experts say, largely because the economy of the last decade has fallen short in generating good job opportunities for their millennial children.

“But the last thing you want is for your kids to end up taking care of you financially,” Ms. Heard said. “And, anyway, kids can learn from their own money struggles.”

Baby boomers face increasing retirement challenges of their own as traditional defined benefit pensions have been widely replaced by riskier 401(k) plans and the like, which require disciplined savings. Many have not done the comprehensive financial planning needed to factor in the greater chance that they will live longer, or accumulated enough in savings and investments to cover future health expenses.

“So they’re not looking at the long-term effects of shelling out $5,000 or so per year to adult kids,” said Jamie Hopkins, associate professor of taxation at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. “That money could be funding an I.R.A. contribution.”

There are clear warning signs, experts said, that parents may be giving their adult children too much money. These include taking loans from 401(k) accounts, failing to make full retirement account contributions or draining savings.

Take Jacquelyn McClellan, 74, who lives in Orange City, Fla. In what admittedly is an extreme case, Ms. McClellan, a retired program analyst for the federal government, began paying for various expenses for her grandchildren after her son said he could not afford them. She paid for dancing school, parochial school, trips to Disneyland, all with the help of money from her pension.

These payments ended up tipping Ms. McClellan into bankruptcy in 2011. Since then, Ms. McClellan has sharply dialed back her own lifestyle. She can’t go on vacation cruises and has only minimal savings.

Still, Ms. McClellan felt a sense of duty to help out her grandchildren. “I didn’t want them to have a bad life,” she said, adding that they are now flourishing.

Giving some financial help can be a much-needed balm for family members. The problem is, many parents approaching or already in retirement do not know where they stand financially and how much they can afford to give without undermining their own security.

Giving gifts of money to chronically needy adult children can become expensive very quickly.

To solve a money squeeze, avoid giving away inheritances early, said Eric J. Schaefer, a certified financial planner at Evermay Wealth Management in Arlington, Va. Adult children often only end up coming back for more money, he explained.

Supporting more extravagant expenses like a fancy car or country club memberships should be cut off altogether, Mr. Schaefer recommended.

One-time loans, or gifts, that are used to pay for unexpected emergencies like medical expenses require little thought for parents who can afford them.

But going back to the money trough time and time again is dangerous. “Look at kids and ask, ‘What is the money for?’” said Robert J. Semrad in Chicago, the senior partner at DebtStoppers, a bankruptcy law firm. “Is this a solution to the problem or just a Band-Aid? Many times money given as a Band-Aid merely delays the inevitable.”

Avoid co-signing loans for cars or homes, Mr. Semrad said, since a parent’s own credit can be jeopardized. “Banks can go after co-signers,” he said. “And having assets makes you more susceptible.”

Properly drafted loans by parents to their children can teach the children valuable financial lessons, though. The keys, experts said, are to give the loans set terms and to establish a regular repayment schedule.

Peter Lazaroff, a financial adviser at Plancorp in Missouri, recommends loans that include interest rates. The loan then works just like a bond, he added, and the parent gets back principal and interest. The child should also sign a contract, which can be drafted by a lawyer. A loan that is not paid back can be deducted from an inheritance.

Kathleen Gurney, who runs the Financial Psychology Corporation in Florida, encouraged parents to structure a loan as if a son or daughter were a business partner. The contract should include loan terms, length and consequences for nonpayment.

“Loaning money works well,” she said, “if the process is objective and well planned.”

Ms. Gurney has seen many cases in which older parents helped their adult children, only to end up in dire financial straits themselves. One couple she counseled had to return to work part time in a restaurant because they had decided to support their divorced son’s wife and children.

“These financial decisions can affect your health and marriage,” she said. “And some people even slip into depression because they must continue to work.”

Experts also caution against giving a loan to an adult child who clearly cannot repay it. Family loans, they point out, are common, but being paid back is less so.

Instead of cash, parents can offer their children networking help in looking for a job and provide other forms of support. But when gifts or loans are involved, the most important thing is to be honest with yourself — and your children.

“Tough love,” said Mr. Hopkins at the American College, “requires parents to plan what they give their children. So you must have a process in place.”",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,New York Times,10-09-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/your-money/financial-assistance-to-adult-children.html,01-03-2016
0,"Americans Aren’t Saving Enough for Retirement, but One Change Could Help","Here is something every non-rich American family should know: The odds are that you will run out of money in retirement.

On average, a typical working family in the anteroom of retirement — headed by somebody 55 to 64 years old — has only about $104,000 in retirement savings, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.

That’s not nearly enough. And the situation will only grow worse.

The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that more than half of all American households will not have enough retirement income to maintain the living standards they were accustomed to before retirement, even if the members of the household work until 65, two years longer than the average retirement age today.


Using a different, more complex model, the Employee Benefit Research Institute calculates that 83 percent of baby boomers and Generation Xers in the bottom fourth of the income distribution will eventually run short of money. Higher up on the income scale, people also face challenges: More than a quarter of those with incomes between the middle of the income distribution and the 75th percentile will probably run short.

The standard prescription is that Americans should put more money aside in investments. The recommendation, however, glosses over a critical driver of unpreparedness: Wall Street is bleeding savers dry.

“Everybody’s big focus is that we have to save more,” said John C. Bogle, founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the investment management colossus. “A greater part of the problem is the failure of investors to earn their fair share of market returns.”

His observation suggests a different policy prescription: shoring up Americans’ retirement requires, first of all, aligning the interests of investment advisers and their clients.

A research paper by Mr. Bogle published in Financial Analysts Journal makes the case. Actively managed mutual funds, in which many workers invest their retirement savings, are enormously costly.

First, there is the expense ratio — about 1.12 percent of assets for the average large capitalization blend fund. Then there are transaction costs and distribution costs. Active funds also pay a penalty for keeping a share of their assets in low-yielding cash. Altogether, costs add up to 2.27 percent per year, Mr. Bogle estimates.

By contrast, a passive index fund, like Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund, costs merely 0.06 percent a year in all.

Of course, Mr. Bogle has a horse in the race. He founded the Vanguard Group. He invented the first index fund for the public. His case is powerful, nonetheless.

Assuming an annual market return of 7 percent, he says, a 30-year-old worker who made $30,000 a year and received a 3 percent annual raise could retire at age 70 with $927,000 in the pot by saving 10 percent of her wages every year in a passive index fund. (Such a nest egg, at the standard withdrawal rate of 4 percent, would generate an inflation-adjusted $37,000 a year more or less indefinitely.) If she put it in a typical actively managed fund, she would end up with only $561,000.

We might have seen this building decades ago. As companies gradually did away with the defined-benefit pensions that once provided working families with their main supplement to Social Security, workers found they had to shoulder the responsibility and risk of saving and investing for retirement largely on their own.

In 1979, almost two in five private sector workers had a defined-benefit pension that would pay out a check until they died. Today only 14 percent do. Almost one in three, by contrast, must make do with a retirement savings account alone to supplement their Social Security check.

If there is an industry rived with conflicts of interest, it is the financial conglomerates that advise Americans on investing these savings. Yet nobody was paying attention to the safeguards that might be needed when corporate retirement funds managed by sophisticated professionals were replaced by individual 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts.

“Wall Street makes no money on low-cost index funds,” said David F. Swensen, who runs the investment portfolio for Yale. “That is the problem.”

It’s not hard to find evidence of Wall Street’s rapaciousness.

Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard and colleagues from M.I.T. and the University of Hamburg sent “mystery shoppers” to visit financial advisers. They found that advisers mostly recommended investment strategies that fit their own financial interests. They reinforced their clients’ misguided biases, encouraging them to chase returns and advising against low-cost options like low-fee index funds.

Another study, by Susan Christoffersen of the University of Toronto and colleagues from the University of Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania, found that investment advisers directed more of their clients’ money to funds that shared the upfront fees with them. Returns of these funds were poor, compared with alternatives.

“It is superslimy,” noted Kent Smetters, an expert on finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

President Obama has tried to take a crack at one corner of the problem: questionable advice provided by managers of I.R.A.s.

For all their flaws, 401(k) plans have a fiduciary responsibility to act in participants’ best interest. Many managers of I.R.A.s, by contrast, are not legally bound to put their clients’ interests first. They must offer “suitable” products — a much squishier standard.

“They can’t put your grandma in a heavy tech fund,” Mr. Smetters said. “But they could put her in a more expensive bond fund that pays them a huge commission.”

It should be no surprise which of these Wall Street prefers. In a 2011 report, the Government Accountability Office of Congress said it found advisers who were paid $6,000 to $9,000 if clients rolled over savings from 401(k) plans to I.R.A.s.

I.R.A.s are a huge source of profit for Wall Street. Workers roll some $300 billion worth of 401(k) balances into I.R.A.s when they leave their jobs every year.

The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers argues that “conflicted advice” by advisers who get payments from the funds they recommend reduces the annual returns to investment by 1 percentage point, a more modest penalty than Mr. Bogle’s analysis might suggest. Still, this could cost savers up to $33 billion a year out of $3.3 trillion invested by I.R.A.s subject to potentially conflicted advice.

In 2010, the Labor Department proposed imposing fiduciary responsibility on I.R.A. advisers. The resistance from Wall Street was so fierce that the Obama administration was forced to back down. Last month, the administration tried again. Perhaps it will have better luck this time.

Mr. Swensen, Mr. Bogle and Mr. Smetters applaud the Obama administration’s shot at changing the rules. But they acknowledge that imposing tighter standards on I.R.A.s will not end suspect advice. And most investment assets are held outside tax-preferred retirement accounts and would not be subject to the rule change.

Unlike regulations in Canada and some Western European countries, which have essentially banned kickbacks from funds to investment advisers, the Obama administration’s proposed rule does not directly attack conflicts of interest.

But the new rule could move American retirement saving one step closer to the goal: getting almost everybody to stop trying to beat the market, put their money in low-cost index funds and leave it there. Then Americans might reach retirement better prepared.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,New York Times,03-03-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/business/americans-arent-saving-enough-for-retirement-but-one-change-could-help.html,01-03-2016
0,U.S. Offers Account to Encourage Retirement Saving,"After an extended test period, the federal government is widely promoting its new savings plan called myRA, which is aimed at people who do not have a retirement plan at work.

Billed as a starter account to encourage retirement saving, the myRA, or my Retirement Account, program has been adjusted to make participation easier. Workers can have money automatically deducted from their paychecks, and they can contribute to the accounts directly, using electronic transfers from a checking or savings account.

No minimum deposit is required, no fees are charged, and depositors have no risk of losing money, according to the Treasury Department. Workers may contribute up to $5,500 a year, or $6,500 if they are 50 or older, with a maximum total of $15,000. Participants may withdraw their contributions tax-free and without a penalty, so the money can be used for emergencies if needed. And the accounts are not tied to a specific employer, so they go with workers who change jobs.

Retirement Investors, Riding Out the Panic
The money is held in a special Roth I.R.A. and invested in United States Treasury savings bonds paying the same variable interest rate as the Government Securities Fund, which is available to federal employees through the government retirement plan. Over the last five years, the fund’s interest rate has averaged 2 percent, Treasury officials said. That is hardly spectacular, but higher than the interest rate on a traditional savings account, they said.

Savers can withdraw their myRA contributions at any time without taxes or penalties. But because the accounts are subject to Roth I.R.A. rules, savers may pay taxes and penalties on the interest earned, if they withdraw their money before age 59½.

Once a saver has contributed the maximum $15,000, or the account has been open for 30 years, it stops earning interest and must be rolled into a private sector Roth I.R.A. to continue growing.
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, said the government was not suggesting that $15,000 was an adequate retirement nest egg. But millions of Americans lack any retirement savings, so they need to begin somewhere, he said. Nearly a third of workers say they have no retirement savings or pension, according to a 2015 report from the Federal Reserve.

“The challenge is to get started in the first place,” Mr. Lew said. Once people get used to saving small amounts, he said, they may become more comfortable saving larger sums to create a thicker retirement cushion.

Nancy Register, national director of the America Saves campaign, called the program a “terrific” tool to get lower- and moderate-income consumers accustomed to saving. “We believe this is a needed product,” she said.

President Obama first directed the Treasury to establish the myRA program in his January 2014 State of the Union address. Since 2014, the department has worked with a group of 60 employers in a pilot program to develop the account.

Tom Galea, president of Norton’s Flowers & Gifts, a floral shop based in Ypsilanti, Mich., said his company took part in the pilot and found the myRA plan simple to use. Six of his 21 employees participate, with some contributing as little as $5 from their paycheck every two weeks. “It’s really a savings training program,” he said.

0,Bank of Canada cuts key interest rate in response to falling oil prices,"OTTAWA—Jobs will be harder to find and the economy will slow as the oil price crash bites in coming months, the Bank of Canada said as it sought to cushion the blow by unexpectedly lowering its key interest rate.
In a signal that fallout from sliding oil prices could be much worse than expected, the central bank reduced its overnight interest rate to 0.75 per cent from 1 per cent.
The Bank of Canada uses the key rate to influence the borrowing costs commercial banks charge business and consumers, which allows the central bank to boost economic growth if there is a risk of sharp downturn.
“We decided that it was appropriate to take out some insurance against that downside risk in the form of a lower interest rate profile,” bank governor Stephen Poloz said after the rate announcement.
It likely means lower mortgage costs for homebuyers and a longer grace period — probably until at least next year — before mortgage holders are squeezed when the Bank of Canada begins to drive up borrowing costs to head off a burst of inflation.
The bank has not altered its key interest rate since September 2010 and the surprise decision went off like a bomb in financial markets. The prospect of increased business investment and commercial activity from lower rates prompted a sharp rally on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The S&P/TSX composite index jumped 251.98 points to 14,560.42.
But the Canadian dollar plummeted, closing on exchange markets at 81.07 (U.S.) cents, down 1.53 cents from its close on Tuesday.
“The dollar has tanked. There is a run to the U.S. dollar,” Rahim Madhavji of Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange wrote in a research note.
The oil price slide is hammering the economy, Poloz said. He predicted growth will stumble to a low 1.5 per cent in the first half of this year. For 2015 as a whole, the bank now predicts growth of 2.1 per cent, well below its previous forecast of 2.4 per cent.
While Poloz’s move may help the economy, in the short run it could increase pressure on Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government to revise its economic approach. The strategy currently hinges on eliminating the federal budget deficit to open the way for $5 billion a year in new spending and tax breaks for families, particularly a controversial plan to allow spouses to split income for tax purposes. Because only about 15 per cent of families would benefit from this $2-billion annual measure, it has been sharply criticized as a waste of valuable financial resources.
Taking into account the new spending announcements by Harper in the fall, falling oil prices put the federal government in danger of running another budget deficit in 2015 instead of meeting its claim that the books will be balanced this year, economists say.
Thrown off course by the oil shock, Finance Minister Joe Oliver took the rare step last week of announcing the 2015 budget announcement will be put off from the usual February-March time slot until April at the earliest.
“This rate cut shows that the Bank of Canada believes the Canadian economy is facing more trouble than the Conservatives are admitting,” NDP finance critic Nathan Cullen said. Oliver’s economic plan is “in the shredder” and it’s time the Harper government abandoned its obsession with a balanced budget and tax cuts and instead bring out an economic stimulus plan, he said.
“We need to make sure that the government’s priority is focused on creating growth and jobs for the middle class,” Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau told reporters. “Right now (the Conservatives’) priority is on continuing to promise a $2-billion tax break for the wealthier Canadians,” he said in reference to Harper’s income-splitting proposal. “That’s simply not responsible.”
Canadian Labour Congress economist Angella MacEwan said Poloz appears to have felt he had to move to stimulate the economy because Oliver had no plan to do so.
“The bank was listening to what the federal government was saying in response to what the bank saw as a huge impact on the Canadian economy and felt that they (the central bank) had to step in and take some action,” she told the Star.
The bank noted lower petroleum costs will have a different impact in different sections of the country.
“While the net impact of lower oil prices on the Canadian economy is negative, the effects across regions and sectors are expected to vary significantly,” the bank said. Business activity in oil-producing regions will suffer, it added.
“In contrast, the manufacturing sector will benefit from stronger demand in the United States, lower shipping costs and the weaker Canadian dollar,” the bank said in its quarterly forecast. Economists have said the Ontario economy should pick up as a result of the oil price shift.
“Growth in Ontario looks okay,” TD Bank economist Derek Burleton told CBC-TV. “This is an insurance move against uncertainty in the economy” by Poloz, he said.
Poloz acknowledged lower borrowing costs may worsen Canada’s record-level of household debt. But he said the need to stabilize the economy in the long run outweighed the risk of financial stability in the household sector.
Oliver said he doesn’t comment on Bank of Canada decisions but added in a statement: “As we’ve always said, Canada is not immune to the economic challenges and decisions made beyond our borders. That is why our government continues our focus on jobs and economic growth. Our plan is working with one of the strongest job and growth records in the G7 group of countries.”
Poloz said the Canadian economy had been showing signs of growth before oil prices dived.
“Outside the energy sector, we are beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger exports, improved business confidence and investment and employment growth,” he said.
He added, “The negative impact of lower oil prices will gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and the bank’s monetary policy response.”",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Toronto Star,01-21-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/21/bank-of-canada-in-surprise-move-cuts-key-interest-rate.html,01-03-2016
0,Global markets panicked by massive stock plunge in China,"BEIJING—China’s stock market fell Monday by its biggest margin in eight years, defying the government’s multibillion-dollar attempt to stop a slide that has wiped out all of the gains of this year’s price boom.
The decline threatened to weigh anew on global markets after last week’s Chinese losses triggered a worldwide selloff.
The European rout worsened, with equities tumbling for a fourth day and Germany’s benchmark gauge heading for a bear market.
All but four shares in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell as the gauge deepened its plunge after its worst week in four years. It slid 3.4 per cent at 12:05 p.m. in London, with miners leading the plunge in industry groups as commodities were set for their lowest levels since 1999. Germany’s DAX Index sank 3.1 per cent, down 21 per cent from its peak.
The rout that began with the devaluation of China’s currency has sent the Stoxx 600 into a correction, closing 13 per cent lower than the record it reached in April. Thirteen out of 18 western-European markets have fallen 10 per cent or more from their high, and the volume of Stoxx 600 shares changing hands almost double the 30-day average on Monday.
“Today everyone seems to be selling off, and there’s panic, there’s no rational choice anymore, no rational reaction,” according to Michael Woischneck of Lampe Asset Management GmbH. “There wont be a rebound today. The Americans will add to the European selling pressure in the afternoon, and that may drive us even lower.”
The DAX, one of the biggest gainers at the start of the year, will be among the most hit due its exposure to China, Woischneck said. If it closes at the current level, it will be the first to enter a bear market among western-European gauges.
All of the region’s national stock measures fell more than 2.5 per cent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index is heading for its lowest level since 2012 and briefly dropped below 6,000. Glencore Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. tumbled more than 6 per cent.
“We’re definitely getting a lot of calls from clients,” Michele Santangelo, a money manager at Vunani Private Clients, said by phone from Johannesburg. “You’re seeing a lot of capitulation, people selling for the sake of selling and wanting to get out of the market.”
Abengoa SA was among the only Stoxx 600 companies rising. A report said one of its shareholders repaid a loan and the shares used as collateral were freed. Modern Times Group AB gained 2.6 per cent after the Swedish media firm said it will cut jobs.
More than $5 trillion have already been wiped out from the value of global stocks since China unexpectedly devalued the yuan, raising concern over a global economic slowdown. The panic intensified at the end of last week, when U.S. equities, which had remained relatively stable, tumbled as investors dumped the biggest winners of 2015.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.5 per cent to close at 3,209.91 points, its biggest one-day loss since an 8.8 per cent decline on Feb. 27, 2007. The index is down 38 per cent from its June 12 peak and just under 1 per cent below its closing on Dec. 31, last year’s final trading day.
The slump has inflicted heavy losses on small investors, souring many on stock ownership and threatening to disrupt Communist Party plans to use the market to raise money for reforms of state industry.
“It feels like the end of the world,” said Pan Chong, a social media specialist. He said he invested 50,000 yuan ($10,350) in April, made 40 per cent and then saw the market wipe out those gains.
“The so-called correction will finally become a long-term bear market,” said Pan, 25. “So I’m considering selling all my shares as soon as possible.”
The Chinese benchmark soared more than 150 per cent starting in late 2014 after state media said shares were inexpensive, which led investors to believe Beijing would shore up prices if needed. Urged on by state media, millions of novice investors rushed into the market.
Prices faltered and then plunged after an unrelated change in banking regulations in June led investors to question whether Beijing’s support might be weakening. The market index fell 30 per cent, prompting Beijing to intervene by barring big shareholders from selling and promising state-owned brokerages and pension funds would buy.
Beijing’s initiatives helped to calm markets. But after the state-owned company charged with buying shares to prop up prices announced it would not intervene every day, the Shanghai index fell 11.5 per cent last week.
China’s plunge plus weaker oil prices drove triple digit losses on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday.
The declines come at a time when exports, manufacturing and other Chinese industries are weakening, leaving little economic foundation for higher share prices.
The latest fall probably was triggered by poor performance at publicly traded companies, said Guo Tianyong, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.
The government reported last week that profits at state-owned companies contracted by 2.3 per cent in July from a year ago, compared with a 0.1 per cent contraction through June.
“We shouldn’t doubt the government’s ability to rescue the market. If they want, they could push up the stock index to 5,000, but it is not necessary for the government to play an excessive role,” said Guo. “It still would be better for the market itself to play its role.”
Beijing’s surprise Aug. 11 devaluation of its yuan added to investor jitters. They worry the change will lead to money flowing out of China, reducing credit available for trading. The central bank has responded by pumping extra money into credit markets.
The ruling party wants to use the markets to raise money for state companies to reduce debt loads and modernize. The party also wants to encourage stock ownership as a way for families to save for retirement, reducing demand for social spending. But small investors whose holdings have plunged in value say they will no longer buy shares.
Lu Zhen, 29, an employee at a financial firm, said the value of his shares rose by 250,000 yuan ($40,000) over the first half of the year. But he said since the June downturn, he has lost that and an additional 150,000 yuan ($24,000).
“This is definitely the end of a bull market,” Lu said.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Toronto Star,08-24-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/08/24/chinas-great-stock-market-fall-panics-global-markets.html,01-04-2016
0,Young — and old — driving resurgence of rental,"The condo sales office had barely opened and demand was expected to be strong for suites in The Selby, a 49-storey tower right on the subway line at Sherbourne and Bloor.
Then co-developer Cityzen got an offer it couldn’t refuse: An institutional investor was looking to snap up all 441 condo units and turn them into something rarely seen downtown in decades – brand new rental apartments.
Incredibly, they aren’t the only ones.
Cityzen Development Group president Sam Crignano says he’s also talking to other institutional investors looking to build rental towers on sites where Cityzen had hoped to eventually construct condos.
“Rents have crept up to the point where the economics of these kinds of deals make a lot of sense,” says Crignano.
“Plus, let’s be frank, one of the issues we’re facing now is affordability. People are finding it harder to just come up with a down payment,” even for new-build condos which are now averaging $454,476 across the GTA.
Even veteran apartment developers The Minto Group, which owns and manages some 17,000 apartments but has largely shifted its sights to building condos, is now taking another look at rental.
Minto recently raised more than $300 million in equity. It is looking to build or refurbish some 6,000 units of rental housing to service what it sees as a seismic shift in how the young – and the old – are going to be living in costly urban centres like Toronto.
“The condo market has shown that there is a deep base of demand now for rental product,” says Greg Rogers, executive vice president of investments for Minto.
Simple economics and demographics are behind the interest in rental, says Paul Golini, executive vice president of Empire Communities, which is also looking at sites that may make more sense for rental than condo towers.
Thankfully, few expect to see a replay of what happened this week to buyers of 181 condo units in Urbancorp’s Kingsclub project on King St. W.: Three years after that developer took deposits averaging about $40,000 per unit, it quietly decided to convert the three planned condo towers to rental.
Rental is back on the radar because rising rents and low interest rates have combined to drive down capitalization rates dramatically, from about 7.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2003 to 4.2 per cent in the same period of 2014, says Nick Yanovski, managing director of capital markets for commercial brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Canada.
That means rental construction – which had virtually died in the wake of rent controls -- is actually profitable again. It’s also now seen as a low-risk, long-term hold with the GTA’s population, and land prices, continuing to rise and the vacancy rate at just 1.6 per cent – even less in the downtown core, says Yanovski.
It’s not just that more first-time buyers are finding themselves priced out of ownership. Many don’t want the responsibility. They want to be downtown, free to seize opportunities in other cities or plough all their spare cash into getting their own companies off the ground.
Strangely enough, aging baby boomers are increasingly in a similar boat.
“Many are living in their retirement savings account,” says Minto’s Rogers.
Baby boomers are likely to start cashing out on their houses in the coming years to free up money for retirement, travel and to help out their kids, he adds. They like the idea of carefree living in professionally run rental buildings, with the ability to move with two months’ notice and no real estate fees if they decide to be closer to the grandkids.
“We’re seeing baby boomers who aren’t sure about moving into a condo, so some of them are just renting and trying it on for size to see how it feels,” says Cityzen’s Crignano.
Builders believe rental demand is likely to keep growing at the expense of home ownership which, as of 2011 in Toronto, stood at historic highs of 65 per cent among 30 to 44-year-olds, up from just 57 per cent in 1991, according to Ottawa-based housing policy researcher Steve Pomeroy.
He’s less confident that institutional investors will get back into rental housing in a big way, given they’ll be competing with a force that has taken over the last decade in Toronto’s housing market – mom-and-pop and foreign investors who’ve bought up condos to rent them out.
Daryl Chong, president and CEO of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association, the umbrella group for apartment owners and property managers, warns that any new rentals are going to be very high end.
In fact, Yorkville seems to be a major focus right now among developers looking for the best rental possibilities.
That’s why the association has proposed a number of incentives – still under consideration at city hall – to boost the supply of more affordable rental, from cuts in development charges (they add about $28,000 per two-bedroom unit) to property tax relief.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Toronto Star,01-30-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/real_estate/2015/01/30/young-and-old-driving-resurgence-of-rental.html,01-04-2016
0,New RBC charges seen as double-dipping: Roseman,"RBC, Canada’s largest bank, is drawing flak about a planned increase in service charges starting June 1.
While other Big Five banks have raised fees this year, RBC’s changes will affect lower-income customers — those who have accounts with low or no monthly fees and a limited number of transactions.
Andrew Cash, federal NDP MP for Dovercourt, has started a petition asking Canadians to stop the expansion of “pay-to-pay” fees. This refers to a practice by some companies to charge customers a fee to pay their monthly bills.
Back in 2012, Cash started a successful campaign to end $2 paper-bill fees by telecom providers. This led to a ban by Canada’s telecom regulator on Jan. 1.
“Banks are charging you extra just to pay things with your own money,” says the MP, who stood outside a bank on Bloor St. W. and Dovercourt Rd. on May 4 collecting signatures for the petition.
RBC announced many service fees and account changes at the same time. One change, in particular, has attracted attention.
“Some debit transactions that didn’t previously count as debit transactions will now count,” said RBC spokesman Andrew Block.
Customers who exceed their monthly limit of free debit transactions will pay a monthly fee of $1 to $2 for each RBC investment contribution and mortgage, loan or credit card payment they make from their accounts.
They will also pay fees for Interac Flash (or tap) point-of-sale debit transactions, which didn’t count against their monthly limit before.
Some affected accounts have no monthly fees — such as the Leo’s Young Savers account, which has 15 free debit transactions, and the Student Banking account, which has 25 free debit transactions.
Another affected account is Day to Day Banking, which has a $4 monthly fee. Starting June 1, these customers will get 12 free debit transactions a month (up from 10).
“Most of the account packages we offer include unlimited transactions, so this change would not apply,” Block pointed out. “Also, 80 per cent of our clients either pay no monthly fee or receive a rebate on their monthly fee.”
Here are other changes RBC announced to clients:
Seniors’ rebates on eligible bank accounts will be restricted to clients aged 65 and over (up from 60-plus). The change will not affect those who already receive a senior’s rebate.
Overdraft protection will cost $4 a month plus overdraft interest (if used). Before, clients would pay either $4 a month or overdraft interest, whichever was higher.
Stop payments done by phone or at branches will cost $20 each (up from $18).
Rebates will increase on some accounts, such as VIP Banking and Signature No Limit, for clients who have multiple products with RBC.
Business banking services, such as electronic deposits and credits, will go up to 75 cents (from 65 cents). Deposit account statements will be $3 each for paper statements with cheque image pages (up from $2).
Pricing changes are always a sensitive issue for clients, said Block. He encouraged clients to call or visit their branch to ensure they have the banking options and advice that best met their needs.
I can appreciate that interest rates are at historic lows, and aren’t expected to rise sharply any time soon. And competition is fierce, especially with branchless banks and mortgage brokers offering access to non-bank providers.
The Big Five banks have costly branch networks to support. Some have already made unpopular changes, such as TD’s decision to stop protecting former Canada Trust customers from higher fees.
However, banks should be fair and progressive in adjusting their service charges.
Is it fair for RBC to collect interest on loan, mortgage and credit-card debt and then charge extra fees to clients making their loan, mortgage and credit card payments once they exceed their monthly debit limits?
Is it progressive for RBC to give clients a large multi-product rebate if they also have mortgages, investments and credit cards with the bank?
In addition, RBC will limit its multi-product rebates to clients with active credit cards (those with an annual fee or with at least one transaction in the past 90 days) and active investments (those with a minimum balance of $500 or a pre-authorized contribution plan set up to the investment account).
Customers have choices. They can switch to banks or credit unions with lower fees, using the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada’s account selector tool. But some don’t want to bank online or go out of their way to visit a branch.
In a climate of low interest rates, I hope the federal government will adopt new rules for pay-to-pay fees by banks as it had done so decisively with telecom providers.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Toronto Star,05-05-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/2015/05/05/new-rbc-charges-seen-as-double-dipping-roseman.html,01-04-2016
0,Global stocks sink after Greece closes banks,"BEIJING—Global stock markets sank Monday after Greece closed its banks and imposed capital controls in a dramatic turn in its struggle with heavy debts.
Oil prices declined and the euro edged down after Athens announced the moves to stanch the flow of money out of Greek banks and pressure creditors to offer concessions before a bailout program expires Tuesday.
Germany’s DAX index tumbled 2.9 per cent to 11,161.41 points in early trading and France’s CAC-40 dived 3.4 per cent to 4,887.69. Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.6 per cent to 6,643.83. Futures augured losses on Wall Street. Dow futures were down 1.1 per cent at 17,677.00. S&P 500 futures shed 1.1 per cent to 2,073.00.
Greece’s Cabinet closed banks for six business days and restricted cash withdrawals. The Athens Stock Exchange was due to be closed Monday. That follows Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ weekend decision to call a referendum on European and International Monetary Fund proposals for Greek reforms in return for bailout funds.
The accelerating crisis has raised questions about whether Greece might withdraw from the 19-nation euro currency, a move dubbed Grexit.
“Even if a deal is somehow reached, the ability of Greece to implement agreed reforms is doubtful,” said IHS Global Insight economist Rajiv Biswas in a report.
Greek withdrawal from the euro could lower Asian economic growth by 0.3 percentage points next year due to disruption in trade and financial markets, Biswas said.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.3 per cent to 4,053.03 despite China’s surprise weekend interest rate cut. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 shed 2.9 per cent to 20,109.95.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 2.6 per cent to 25,966.98 and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was off 2.2 per cent at 5,422.50. Seoul’s Kospi dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,060.49 and India’s Sensex declined 1.5 per cent to 27,385.05.
The euro slipped to $1.1066 from the previous session’s $1.1168. The dollar declined to 122.96 yen from 123.89 yen.
Globally, Greece’s brinksmanship with its creditors is unlikely to have the impact of the financial panic set off by the collapse of Lehman Bros. in September 2008, economists said.
“Today, the European banks have shed much of their Greek debt and they have significantly increased their capital,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
“A Greek default and exit from the euro zone would be devastating to Greece’s economy, but no one else’s,” said Zandi. “So, the Greek standoff will be disconcerting to financial markets, but only temporarily.”
The European Central Bank has vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent a financial panic.
The ECB is committed to buying 60 billion euros a month in bonds to push down interest rates and help economies that use the euro. It could buy more and flood financial markets with cash to calm jittery investors.
“They stand ready to do whatever it takes,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
China’s rate cut, the fourth since November, appeared to be aimed at reassuring investors after a plunge in share prices last week, rather than boosting economic growth, analysts said.
Beijing cut its benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage point and freed up money for lending by lowering the reserves banks are required to hold.
The timing is “rather market-friendly” and appears to be meant to “provide a support to the market sentiment,” said Credit Suisse economists Dong Tao and Weishen Deng in a report.
In energy markets, U.S. benchmark crude declined $1.11 to $58.52 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 7 cents in the previous session to close at $59.63. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.24 cents to $62.02 in London.

0,What Is the Point of College?,"I gave my first university lecture in philosophy at the University of Ghana, Legon, when I was a freshly credentialed 21-year-old. My audience was a couple of hundred students gathered in a vast hall, with ceiling fans to move the hot and humid air. Above the murmur of the fans and the muttering of students, I tried to explain why Descartes thought the mere possibility that there was an Evil Demon deceiving their senses meant they couldn’t know for sure that I was really there. Ah, Cartesian skepticism! I remember diagraming the structure of the argument in huge chalk letters on an enormous blackboard.

After the class, a group of students, many of them older than I, followed me home across campus. Was I really worried, they wanted to know, that there might be such a powerful Evil Demon? What they didn’t ask was why they had to listen to this bizarre argument made by a Frenchman three and a half centuries earlier. Yes, the material would be on the exam every student had to pass at the end of the first year. But why?

The answer used to be easy: College is a place where you come to learn such things. But as higher education expands its reach, it’s increasingly hard to say what college is like and what college is for. In the United States, where I now teach, more than 17 million undergraduates will be enrolling in classes this fall. They will be passing through institutions small and large, public and private, two-year and four-year, online and on campus. Some of them will be doing vocational courses — in accounting or nursing or web design — at for-profit institutions like DeVry University and the University of Phoenix. Many will be entering community colleges hoping to gain a useful qualification or to prepare themselves for a transfer to a four-year college. Others will be entering liberal-arts colleges without plans for a major, let alone a profession. On whatever track, quite a few will encounter Descartes as part of their undergraduate requirements. Why should that be? You’ll be hard-pressed to find a consensus on such things. That’s because two distinct visions of higher education contend throughout our classrooms and campuses.

One vision focuses on how college can be useful — to its graduates, to employers and to a globally competitive America. When presidential candidates talk about making college more affordable, they often mention those benefits, and they measure them largely in dollars and cents. How is it helping postgraduate earnings, or increasing G.D.P.? As college grows more expensive, plenty of people want to know whether they’re getting a good return on their investment. They believe in Utility U.

Another vision of college centers on what John Stuart Mill called ‘‘experiments in living,’’ aimed at getting students ready for life as free men and women. (This was not an entirely new thought: the ‘‘liberal’’ in ‘‘liberal education’’ comes from the Latin liberalis, which means ‘‘befitting a free person.’’) Here, college is about building your soul as much as your skills. Students want to think critically about the values that guide them, and they will inevitably want to test out their ideas and ideals in the campus community. (Though more and more students are taking degrees online, most undergraduates will be on campus a lot of the time.) College, in this view, is where you hone the tools for the foundational American project, the pursuit of happiness. Welcome to Utopia U.

Together, these visions — Utility and Utopia — explain a great deal about modern colleges and universities. But taken singly, they lead to very different metrics for success.

Consider the declining proportion of fac­ulty with tenure. Tenured faculty are defined by more than the fact that they are hard to fire. Tenure allows professors to pursue intellectual projects without regard for what the trustees or the governor or the community care about. It gives them the kind of intellectual freedom that has helped make our universities the research powerhouses of the world. Adjunct faculty, on the other hand, are a lot less expensive — they’re paid less and typically lack health and other benefits — and you can easily expand or contract their ranks as demand fluctuates. In the Utility vision, students are consumers; they have needs and desires to be met, at a price they’ll pay. If pleasing the customer is the goal, a tenured faculty member who wants to teach what he or she considers worth teaching can be an inconvenience. Plus, at Utility U., one obvious way to better your ‘‘value proposition’’ is to cut costs. These days, three-quarters of the teaching faculty at America’s nonprofit colleges and universities are hired as adjuncts with no tenure and no research support. A few decades ago, only a quarter were.

At Utility U., the search for efficiency requires tools for evaluating teachers. Management, as the old saw has it, is measurement. Years ago, I was on a committee at a great university that looked into the system by which students evaluated courses. The most reliable predictor of whether students liked a course, it turned out, was their answer to the question ‘‘Did the professor respect you?’’ Customers like to be loved; attentive service makes for good Yelp reviews. But that’s a very different question from, say: How, if at all, did you change through the class? What good, if any, did those changes do you? Did you learn to uncover the ideological or conceptual demons that may be flummoxing your good sense? Mr. Chips’s encouraging smile has pedagogical value, but so, perhaps, does Professor Kingsfield’s basilisk stare.

If Utility U. is concerned with value, Utopia U. is concerned with values. The values agenda can involve the content of classes, the nature of campus communities or both. When I teach a seminar that deals with theories of identity and social justice, my aim is to provide tools of analysis so that students — men and women of various ethnic, religious and sexual descriptions — can sort through such issues by themselves. But class discussions aren’t always abstract and impersonal: Everyone has identity allegiances and intuitions about justice. And the same is true for discussions elsewhere on campus. At Utopia U., the aim is to create a safe space, to check your privilege and suspend the prejudices of the larger world, to promote human development and advance moral progress.

And so ‘‘civility’’ is on the agenda, ‘‘safe’’ spaces are spreading and microaggressions — possibly unintentional slights that stem from racial, ethnic or sexual difference — are to be scrutinized, sometimes through a jeweler’s loupe. It’s easy to roll your eyes at ‘‘social justice warriors,’’ but there’s a perfectly good idea here: People don’t think well when they feel personally insulted or aggrieved. And in classes, thinking well is the main objective. Buzzwords aside, a lot of this is just courtesy — Emily Post by way of Foucault. Still, the Utopians can be reluctant to admit that there may be conflicts between expanding civility and deepening understanding, between the safe-space ideal and the free-speech ideal. (Not a few campus quarrels come down to: Who’s silencing whom?) A culture of civility sometimes does make 

Neither Utility U. nor Utopia U. has the full run of any one campus. In the familiar caricature, there’s the performance-studies major who is putting up fliers for the Naomi Klein talk, collecting signatures for the fossil-free petition and wondering whether the student alliance for gender equity is as racially inclusive as it claims. Then there’s the engineering major, first in the family to go to college, traipsing across the quad with a discounted, two-editions-out-of-date version of the material-science textbook. All that identity stuff is a dimly perceived distraction in this student’s light cone, readily tuned out. One student thinks ‘‘bi-curious’’ is a word; the other doesn’t see why you would use molecular-orbital theory when valence bonding provides answers faster. The two students cross paths only physically. It’s almost as if they’re attending two different colleges.

One reason this is a caricature is that people aren’t always found on the expected side of the disciplinary (and class) divides. At liberal-arts campuses, certainly, almost everyone drinks from the fountain of human betterment, albeit some from a Dixie cup and others from a Big Gulp. And very few are completely unmindful of the getting-a-job thing that’s rumored to follow graduation. But when you superimpose the two visions of college — as a forcing house of virtue and as means for building human capital — you inevitably get interference patterns, ripples and ridges of indignation and disquiet. That’s what you’re seeing when the safe-space ethic runs amok, as with students who claim offense when their ideas are challenged or who want to see ‘‘trigger warnings’’ on even canonical literature, like those cardboard lids on hotel-room glasses. Here, the student is at once the sensitive servant of high causes and a demanding customer.

Nor are these tensions likely to resolve themselves, because higher education has to play so many roles. The truth is that colleges and universities do a tremendous amount that neither of these pictures captures — that just can’t be reduced to the well-being of their graduates. For one thing, the old ideal of knowledge for its own sake hasn’t been extinguished. For another, universities are the homes of all kinds of public goods. They are, for example, the source of much of today’s best research. Without them we would know much less than we do about the nature of the cosmos or the workings of the human brain or the ways of reading a novel. A flourishing literary culture is made possible not because institutions of higher learning create writers but because they prepare readers (and yes, it helps that they provide jobs for plenty of poets and novelists too). There’s even something to be said, especially in a democracy, for an educated citizenry, able to question the creeds of the moment.

Which brings us back to demons and doubt. Was there any point to studying such things? My first class of freshmen, all those years ago, certainly had reservations about Monsieur Descartes’s method of systematic doubt. Once they were reassured about their instructor’s sanity, though, they got into the spirit of things, and some, at least, came to see why epistemology — the study of knowledge — might be worthwhile. Maybe not practical … unless you were looking for a job as a professor. But interesting. Mind-expanding, even. Possibly, there was something to be said for the intellectual discipline of second-guessing what you thought was true. And that wasn’t just good for them. Who would want to live in a nation of people without doubts?

Like most of the students I’ve had since, they learned that what you can do and who you can be — the qualities of your skills and of your soul — are two separate questions that aren’t quite separable. And that college was a pretty good place to work out some answers to both",Business/Technology,Local News,New York Times,09-08-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/magazine/what-is-the-point-of-college.html,01-04-2016
0,"Thanksgiving, With or Without Turkey","LOS ANGELES — FOUR centuries after the pilgrims, families are still celebrating their successful arrival on North American shores with a big meal at the end of November. But the big roasted turkey doesn’t always have the starring role.

In the family of Margoth Abrego, a 56-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, the whole bird never makes it to the dinner table. Instead, two turkeys (one cooked in the oven, the other on the stovetop) are picked apart in the kitchen, then stuffed in bread to make a Salvadoran dish called pan con chumpe.

The pan con chumpe is served alongside arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas), a traditional Puerto Rican dish. For the Abrego family, Thanksgiving is a celebration of their roots in distant places — and a reminder of the long struggle to keep the family united. For 14 years, Ms. Abrego grew up in El Salvador without her mother, who had left to work in Los Angeles hotels and remarried into a Puerto Rican family.

“My mom can’t talk about her childhood without crying,” said Ms. Abrego’s daughter, Leisy Abrego, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “She’s still trying to make up for all those years she lost with her mother.”

This Thanksgiving, five generations of the Abrego family will be seated together. In an age when America’s borders are harder to cross than ever, not every immigrant family is so fortunate.

Thanksgiving, we’re told in school, began as an encounter between cultures. Abraham Lincoln formalized it as a national celebration during the Civil War, seeking to bind together a divided and wounded people. Today, with ample apologies to our Native American friends, the fourth Thursday in November is our most widely embraced and beloved gathering.

American airports do not fill to the brim on July 3 with people trying to make it home in time for Fourth of July barbecues. Christmas is a religious holiday. But Thanksgiving goes well with a prayer from any faith, and is now enjoyed with an increasingly multiethnic cuisine. It’s a celebration of the force that binds our diverse country together: family.

You can easily find recipes for Bengali Thanksgiving feasts, Chinese turkey steamed buns and accounts of Armenian family Thanksgiving reunions. Ask a rabbi, and he or she will probably tell you not to worry: Thanksgiving can be kosher, too.

For most ethnic groups that have settled in America over the past century, the “traditional” Thanksgiving meal was once something foreign and exotic. My Guatemalan immigrant parents didn’t truly embrace it until they divorced and remarried into Jewish and Mexican-American families. (My own verdict: The tamales are great, but I still prefer plain old turkey and stuffing.)

For those young immigrants lucky enough to be reunited this year with parents or other relatives, this Thanksgiving will serve as an introduction to the promise, and the complications, of life in the United States.

“They’re just trying to reconnect with their families,” said Professor Abrego, whose immigrant experiences led her to write the book “Sacrificing Families: Navigating Laws, Labor, and Love Across Borders.” They will sit at tables across from parents they haven’t seen for years — or who have remarried.

“For someone who grew up with that desire to be connected with the parent who was gone for so long, being able to share space in the kitchen and make a meal together is a big deal,” Professor Abrego said.

For others, Thanksgiving is a time to pray for reunions long delayed by the complications of their immigration status.

“With my friends, we made tamales last year, and a turkey, too,” said a 60-year-old housekeeper from El Salvador, who requested that I not publish her name because she’s living in Los Angeles with an expired visa.

The housekeeper has been here 15 years, but has never celebrated a Thanksgiving with her two adult children, who have remained in El Salvador. Instead, she’s spent her Thanksgivings in California with the friends, neighbors and co-workers who have become her adopted family.

The days off are a welcome break from the long, mostly silent hours of labor as a live-in domestic near the beach at Malibu. Her wages, she says, help her son make ends meet and keep her daughter in graduate school.

“I’ve been struggling to keep them going over there and to pay our debts,” she said. “I’m proud of that, even though I’m really lonely.”

The highlight of an ordinary week is when her employers allow her to use one of their computers to make a video call to El Salvador. Her 7-year-old grandson, whom she’s never met in person, recently won a second-place medal for academic achievement in the second grade, she said.

For her friends, she dishes up a curtido, or relish, with fresh vegetables and mustard. If she could have all her own family together for Thanksgiving, she’d make a sopa de gallina india, a traditional Salvadoran chicken soup.

“That would be marvelous,” she said. “If I could spend time with my family on any day.”",Soft News,Local News,New York Times,11-25-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/opinion/thanksgiving-with-or-without-turkey.html,01-04-2016
0,Peer Pressure (not Parent Pressure) Helps Picky Eaters Try New Foods,"Many parents struggle to persuade their school-aged children to take to heart the value of eating a healthy, varied diet, one that is colorful, full of vegetables and fruits and light on the bland, refined white grains like bread, pasta and pizza that go down so easily with children. Marlo and Corey, parents of Brooke, 10, and Hunter, 7, want the whole family to sit down to eat one, balanced meal together, but Brooke refuses to eat many foods, preferring pasta with butter and cheese or ramen noodles. Her younger brother almost always follows her lead, and Marlo and Corey have been willing to prepare something different for each child just to be sure that they eat enough.

Marlo and Corey hope to change that pattern, so they, along with Brooke, a sixth grader, and Hunter, a third grader, have agreed to participate in the Picky Eater Project. We (the authors Sally Sampson, founder and editor of the nonprofit children’s cooking magazine Chop Chop and Natalie Digate Muth, a practicing pediatrician and registered dietitian) will coach the whole family. Our hope, and our plan, is that helping the parents to change their approach, encouraging the family to cook together, and adjusting routines can help transform family meals and the children’s food preferences without loading on extra cost, time or family battles.

We started by interviewing the whole family to better understand the children’s food preferences as well as identify opportunities for them to willingly, of their own volition, try new foods. Our first suggestion came as a bit of a (pleasant) surprise to Marlo and Corey; they invited family friends over for dinner. Marlo and Corey made the main course; their guests arrived with some interesting appetizers.

Marlo and Corey prepared steak, rice and Caprese, a tomato and mozzarella salad, which they did not expect the children to eat. Their neighbors brought steamed mussels and a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, among them artichoke leaves, green grapes, oranges, spicy green peppers, carrots, heirloom tomatoes and grape tomatoes. The children had just gotten home from swimming practice and were very hungry. The timing was somewhat strategic, as hungry kids as well as adults, are generally more willing to eat whatever is placed in front of them.

Simply tasting a new food helps to “train the taste buds.” It can take 15 to 20 tries, but eventually a previously rejected taste can become more acceptable, and even preferred. We had coached Marlo and Corey not to make a big deal about new foods — specifically, not to force or even urge the children to try any of them. We want to nudge the children to try something without pressuring them, which actually sets off a counterproductive response — “if they are selling it so hard, it must be gross.” We do not subscribe to the “you have to take just one bite” school of thought. The parents’ job is to offer a variety of foods: The children’s job is to decide if they want to eat those foods or not.

The youngest friend turned out to have a very adventurous palate. As soon as the food was set out she propped herself at the kitchen table and started snacking on the mussels, carrots and tomatoes, and even took a bite of the spicy pepper. At first, the older children didn’t notice. Hunter started trolling through the pantry looking for bread, and Marlo gently redirected him to choose from the foods that were available in the kitchen as “appetizers.” Hunter was hungry, so he ate. He went for the green grapes but also tried a grape tomato and carrots, both of which he liked.

After noticing his friend eating the mussels, his parents told us later, Hunter seemed intrigued. He kept walking by and eyeing them. He said he was afraid to eat the mussels because they might make him throw up. He started sniffing them. He then went to Corey and asked him what he thought about “that weird-looking food over there. What is it made of?” He dared Brooke to try one but she refused. “Gross.” He asked Corey to “please come over and look at this thing. What does it taste like?” He picked one up and smelled it. Then he licked it.

Marlo says that during this whole scenario, she was biting her tongue and pretending not to notice, stopped herself from cajoling Hunter into trying a mussel. She couldn’t believe what happened next: Hunter took the mussel out of the shell and popped it in his mouth. Chewed. Swallowed. And then said that it was delicious and he really liked it.

Brooke tried one too, as did the other, older visiting child. Brooke said that it was actually pretty good, but that it “tasted odd. It has the texture of bubble gum but I like how salty it tasted.” But one was enough for her. Hunter ate several more and at the end of the night declared mussels to be his new favorite food.

As everyone sat down for dinner, Marlo and Corey implemented the one-meal rule. Brooke and Hunter would not be getting a separate meal tonight. They didn’t pay much attention because they were busy chatting and eating their favorite parts of the dinner with their friends (mostly the steak and white rice). They didn’t eat or even try everything on their plates, and that was O.K.

Marlo and Corey thought that the meal was a big success. Clearly, watching a friend casually eat foods that seemed unfamiliar had more of an influence than their encouragement (although they hope this newfound willingness to try a new food would carry over into their own regular family meals). They also acknowledged that it was difficult not to pressure the children to just take one bite. Both still believed that had the outcome been different — if the children had not tried any of the foods and did not eat the dinner — they would have defaulted to their old routine of making the children their own separate meal without thinking twice about it, because they cannot stomach the idea of sending them to bed hungry.

This week, we asked Marlo and Corey to do the following:

1. Agree on a plan. We suggest choosing one or two of the following “kitchen rules” and really sticking to them. Our suggestions (from last week’s Picky-Free Parenting Rules):

We will only eat in the kitchen. We will not walk around the house with snacks and drinks. We will not eat dinner in the living room in front of the TV or computer. We may occasionally “break” this rule, but very infrequently.

We will eat family meals together whenever possible. You don’t have to eat everything, or anything if you don’t want to, but we will all sit down together at the same time to share a meal.

When we eat, we will be mindful and not have distractions, like television and phones. The rule applies to all of us.

We will not make separate meals. As the parent, I will decide what food is offered. I will take into consideration preferences of other family members. As kids, you can decide what you want to eat of what I offer you, and how much, but I will not be making other meals. If you do not want to eat now, then you may have a fruit or vegetable as a snack later. But that is it.

Snacks will occur at certain predetermined times. We will not graze all day.

2. Transform the fridge Nudge your family towards healthier choices by storing the healthy foods front and center, and the less healthy foods, or the preferred foods you wish your child would eat less of, in harder to see places. Here’s how:

•Put the not-so-healthy items in the back of the refrigerator. This way, you and your family will have to work a little bit to find and eat them. That one extra step will go a long way in those foods being eaten less frequently.

•Put the fruits and vegetables on the main shelves, front and center in the refrigerator. We have all had healthy produce go bad because it we forgot about it in a fruit and vegetable drawer. If you put them in a location that can’t be missed you and the family will be more likely to eat them. If you prep the healthy stuff, it is more likely to be eaten. Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables and cut them into snack-sized pieces. Put them in clear containers so they won’t be missed.

•Place leftovers and food that needs to be eaten soon in an easy-to-find location. Plan to use leftovers for lunches and snacks. For example, use leftover chicken in salads and sandwiches instead of pre-packaged and not-so-healthy (due to high sodium and nitrites) deli meat.

3. Transform the pantry The food available in your pantry can make or break your picky eater project. You will eat much healthier by default when you stock your pantry in a way that makes eating a variety of healthful foods easy. Here’s how:

•Throw away all outdated food and any packaged food that contains any variation of sugar as the first or second ingredient. Do the same with the high-sodium products. Does a single serving of chips provide more than half of your child’s recommended sodium level? Toss it. It is O.K. to hold on to items that you can’t toss because you need to use them occasionally (say brown sugar or granulated sugar) or foods that you just aren’t ready to part with, but when you restock the pantry, store them in harder-to-see and reach places.
•Now, restock with just the good stuff. A good snack is a whole food, like fruits or vegetables (fresh, frozen, dried, canned or baked), whole grains, nuts or seeds, whole-grain crackers, cheese, plain yogurt or eggs. To evaluate packaged snacks, look for foods with less than 15 percent of calories from saturated fat, no trans fat, less than 210 milligrams of sodium and no more than 13 grams of added sugars per serving.

We asked Brooke and Hunter to do the following:

1. Together with your parents, come up with one new breakfast you’ll eat this week. Try to choose a breakfast that includes grains (ideally whole grains), protein (like egg, meat, nuts or seeds), a fruit or vegetable and dairy (like milk, yogurt or cheese). We suggested recipes: Double Corn Pancakes, Frittata or
Yogurt Parfait

2. Try one new food that you’ve never had before.

3. Make one or more of these great tasting snacks: Energy bars, Fruit kabobs.

4. Make a dinner that is customizable, like Fish Tacos.

Stay tuned for next week to check in on how it goes.",Soft News,Local News,New York Times,09-23-2015,http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/peer-pressure-not-parent-pressure-helps-picky-eaters-try-new-foods/,01-04-2016
0,Coyotes Create Dangers and Divisions in New York Suburbs,"Periodically, it seems, an animal species arises to wreak havoc on the best laid plans of human beings. In years past, deer have eaten every hosta and tulip in sight, wild turkeys have chased homeowners off their lawns, bears have ripped apart bird feeders like tin cans.

This year, it is the coyote.

In New York City, where Eastern coyotes are having a breakout year, a glimpse of one of the animals is still rare enough to elicit curious amazement. But in the suburbs, the feeling is different.

In New Castle, N.Y., residents are warring over what to do about the animals, which attacked and killed a number of small dogs in the town this past year. In Saddle River, N.J., a man was bitten by a rabid coyote in April as he worked in his yard. And in Stamford, Conn., dozens of cats have gone missing, and coyotes have started attacking larger dogs, even German shepherds and golden retrievers.

“Ten years ago, it was rare to see coyotes, but they have really exploded on the scene here,” said Capt. Richard Conkin of the Stamford Police Department. He said that starting in March, the animals seemed to become more aggressive. One resident had to fight a “small, scrappy coyote” off with a snow shovel. Another watched as the same coyote chased her shepherd mix to her front door, which she slammed on the animal seconds after her dog made it safely into the house.

Particularly vulnerable are dogs and cats whose owners have installed invisible electric fences, designed to keep the animals from wandering. They trap the pets in while allowing predators unfettered access to the yard.

Michael Dresner remembers the morning in spring 2013 when his family’s dog disappeared. Ruby, a miniature goldendoodle, was in the front yard of their Chappaqua, N.Y., home at 10 a.m. on a Sunday, kept in by an invisible fence.

“My wife, Jill, heard a screeching noise, and we went outside and couldn’t find Ruby,” he remembered. They searched for hours but never found the dog, who they believe was killed by a coyote. “Our suspicion is that she was attacked on our front porch and dragged off,” he said.

“We chose to move up here because it’s wooded and not as densely populated as the city,” said Mr. Dresner, who relocated from the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “The concept of living in the country is that you can let your dog outside. But we didn’t expect we would live in an area with animals as violent as coyotes.”

Coyotes, which as long as 75 years ago moved into the eastern United States from the West, are viewed by naturalists as a beneficial part of the ecosystem, because they keep rodents in check. They have been sighted in all 21 counties of New Jersey and every town in Connecticut.

They are now so well established — New York State has an estimated 14,500 breeding pairs — that any effort to reduce the population would be fruitless, officials say.

“They are an intelligent animal and quickly learn how to survive in their environment, whether that’s the Bronx or Clinton County,” said Gordon R. Batcheller, the chief wildlife biologist for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. “They are a permanent presence in New York.”

Throughout the region, animal control officers and private trappers work with homeowners and state wildlife officials to capture and euthanize problem or nuisance coyotes. That includes a coyote seen lurking around a school, for example, or one that has preyed on pets in a particular neighborhood.

State officials generally do not allow such coyotes to be relocated because that would merely transfer the problem to another area.

Mostly, the message from wildlife officials is that residents in coyote country need to adapt. “Just like you keep an eye on your kid in the backyard, you keep an eye on your dog,” said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. “It’s not modifying your lifestyle; it’s just common sense.”

Tips for peaceful coexistence with coyotes include keeping dogs on leashes, feeding pets only indoors, hazing coyotes (shouting, waving one’s harms) to prevent their comfort with humans and reporting any bold or aggressive behavior.

That advice did not help John Zeug, of Saddle River, N.J., who was spreading lime on his lawn in April when a coyote entered his three-acre property.

“She came running at me, and I made myself big like they say you should do, and she ran into the woods,” Mr. Zeug, 78, recalled. “And then I turned around, and 20 seconds later she came up and bit me in my left calf. She let loose thankfully and ran away. I had three puncture wounds, and one oozed for the next six weeks.”

The coyote was rabid, and Mr. Zeug required a series of rabies shots. State officials shot the coyote in his yard just as he returned from filling a prescription for antibiotics. They then discovered her six dead pups under his shed.

In Westchester County, in 2010, several children were bitten in communities along Long Island Sound, including a 3-year-old girl in the backyard of Tricia Ellis’s home in Rye.

A necropsy revealed that the coyote was, in fact, healthy. But several months later, in nearby Rye Brook, another coyote, this one rabid, attacked a teenage boy at a birthday party, as well as a man and his 2-year-old daughter.

Ms. Ellis has since moved with her family to another part of Rye. Just last month, she saw a coyote on her street. “We’re very cautious about spending evenings in the garden,” she said. “You think it’s safe, but it’s not.”

Farther north in New Castle, an affluent town that includes the hamlet of Chappaqua, coyotes have emerged as a flash point in the past year. After numerous reports of missing pets, including the Dresners’, and witness accounts of attacks, opinion in town was so divided that the town supervisor, Rob Greenstein, appointed two advisory committees to make recommendations.

“It appeared that one group was more concerned with protecting coyotes, while the other was more concerned with protecting their pets,” he said.

The issue attracted the interest of animal-rights activists from outside the county. Soon, the town was being attacked on social media for waging “coyote jihad.”

In the end, Mr. Greenstein had the police chief and the town’s environmental coordinator distill the two sets of recommendations and devise a coyote response plan, which was made final this month. It lays out steps for the local police to follow, depending on the situation. For nonaggressive encounters, the police will, if asked, provide information on how to prevent human-coyote conflict. But if a coyote attacks an attended pet, the episode will be noted on an online map and the police may take steps to remove the wild animal.

“We found that each side was so passionate about the issue that it was better for us to come up with a reasonable compromise,” said Mr. Greenstein, who is now being challenged for his town supervisor seat by the chairwoman of the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, the more pro-coyote group.

Jim Horton, a licensed trapper in Westchester County, said that he had trapped a dozen coyotes in the past year, but that in “99 percent of the calls I get for coyotes, I talk the people out of trapping.” He added: “Coyotes are here. They are here to stay, and we’re not going to be able to eliminate them from the area.”

And coyotes themselves are not always the root of the problem. Two years ago, Mr. Horton offered his services pro bono when one was loitering outside his children’s elementary school in Hawthorne, N.Y. It turned out a neighborhood woman was feeding it.

“We found pork chops on the snow,” he recalled. “This lady lived right across from the school field, and she was feeding the coyote. Her response was that she felt bad because she saw the coyote all by itself.”",Soft News,Local News,New York Times,06-23-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/nyregion/coyotes-create-dangers-and-divisions-in-new-york-suburbs.html,01-04-2016
0,Giant Panda Gives Birth to Two Cubs at the National Zoo,"Panda lovers, rejoice. Mei Xiang, a giant panda at the National Zoo in Washington, gave birth to healthy twin cubs on Saturday, just three days after the zoo’s staff discovered that she was pregnant.

The first birth, at 5:34 p.m., was broadcast live online on the zoo’s Panda Cam and announced on its official Twitter account. The second birth, at 10:07 p.m., was unexpected and was announced on Twitter. The announcement included a picture that appeared to show the cub being examined by veterinarians.

“It appears healthy,” the zoo said on Twitter.

Mei Xiang is a minor celebrity in Washington, and her breeding is watched closely by panda fans around the world. Giant pandas mate infrequently, and the birth of a healthy cub is uncommon. Mei Xiang has never before given birth to more than one healthy cub at a time. Bao Bao, one of her cubs who was born in 2013, was followed a day later by a stillborn sibling.

Besides Bao Bao, Mei Xiang has had only two cubs who survived: Tai Shan, who was born in 2005, and a cub who died in 2012 shortly after its birth.

On Saturday, people could watch live online as she gave birth to the first cub, which happened 30 minutes after her water broke as she lay on her back in a narrow cage.

“It doesn’t get old for us,” Laurie Thompson, a zoo official, told reporters on Saturday. “We’re very excited to share this with you guys, our new cub.”

Ms. Thompson, speaking before the second birth, said the mother and the first cub were “doing really, really well.”

The zoo said it expected that Mei Xiang would spend the next one to two weeks in her den bonding with the cub. Veterinarians do not expect to examine the first animal for several weeks, they said. Its sex will be determined at that time.

Zookeepers were not sure Mei Xiang was pregnant until they discovered a four-centimeter-long fetus during an ultrasound procedure Wednesday morning. At the time, the zoo predicted that the cub would be born between Aug. 28 and mid-September, but also warned that there was “a substantial possibility” that Mei Xiang could “resorb or miscarry” the fetus.

Those warnings, however, appeared to be for naught on Saturday. Not only was one cub born, but two. The zoo said it would release more pictures and video of the first cub soon.

The National Zoo said on Wednesday that it did not know the identity of the cubs’ father. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated on April 26 and 27 with semen from both Hui Hui, a giant panda who lives at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in China’s Sichuan Province, and from Tian Tian, a giant panda at the National Zoo.

Hui Hui’s semen was collected in China, frozen and flown to Washington, while zookeepers used what they called “high-quality fresh semen” collected from Tian Tian.

“A cub by Mei Xiang and Hui Hui would be very genetically valuable, helping to preserve the genetic diversity of the panda population in human care,” the zoo said in a statement Wednesday.

All of Mei Xiang’s previous cubs were sired by Tian Tian. Genetic testing will be done to determine the cubs’ father, the zoo said.",Soft News,Local News,New York Times,08-22-2015,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/giant-panda-gives-birth-at-national-zoo-in-washington.html,01-04-2016
0,How to teach your dog to come at the dog park,"My daughter has a four-year-old dog that will not consistently come when called. In our yard, he comes to me. When out with other dogs in the green space, it seems like he deliberately runs away. At the dog park, he will not come until he has played for a few minutes. How can I get him to come reliably?
It is not surprising that many dogs choose play over coming when called. We make similar decisions. We grumble if disturbed during a good hockey game or favourite television show. Children show obvious dejection and dawdle when asked to leave a party. We all want to prolong the fun.
Dogs are no different. During play, there is a cost to coming when called: The fun stops. If we are not careful, the word “come” can start to mean it’s time to leave. That is not positive for social creatures.
Treats might not trump play but there are ways to get past this.
If the dog has learned that “come,” means run, choose a new word like “here” and start over. Make every effort to ensure this word leads to positive experiences. Use special treats, fun, games and anything else that is good in your dog’s world. Be generous to a fault at this stage.
Next, drill various distractions in controlled environments. Too many people jump from easy recalls to the dog park without intermediary steps. That is like going from kindergarten to university. The leap in skill level is too great. Many dogs cannot come away from a piece of food. It is no wonder they will not come when called when playing with another dog.
One clever drill is to put food in a bowl, then place a colander over the bowl and tape the two pieces together. The dog will be able to see and smell the food but not reach it. Practise calling your dog away from this tempting distraction. Use a leash or long line to prevent the dog from grabbing the bowl and dashing off. If the dog is at the right grade level, they might hesitate, but they should listen.
Finally, if you cannot beat them, join them. Use activities that your dog loves as a reward. If a dog likes sniffing trees for pee-mail, call them away from a tree. Reward them with a treat and then send them back to sniff some more. The dog learns that “here” is not the end of their fun, but an opportunity to earn more free time. Carry this lesson up through to the dog park. Use more free play as a reward for coming away from other dogs during play.
Do give a little bit of leeway. Sometimes our dogs feel trapped by other dogs in their space. They might need a moment to diffuse a situation before obeying.
Our dog confuses sit with down. When we say sit, he bounces between sitting and lying down. How do we get him to be more accurate?
Part of training a dog to understand a command involves drilling for clarity. This means that sit means sit and down means down. The term used by trainers is stimulus control.
Play training games. Ask them to perform skills they know. Only reward responses that are correct the first time. Do not reward incorrect responses.
This teaches dogs to focus more carefully on the words and to associate them with the correct actions. Make sure to teach stay as well. Some dogs take silence as an indication they were wrong. Stay helps them learn to hold position firmly when correct.",Soft News,Local News,Toronto Star,10-02-2015,http://www.thestar.com/life/2015/10/02/how-to-teach-your-dog-to-come-at-the-dog-park.html,01-05-2016
0,Now's the time to install winter tires,"With all of the information available on the subject, it's surprising that some drivers remain unconvinced that winter tires are safer than all-season tires.
In most driving situations, winter tires outperform all-season tires on cold surfaces and in winter conditions. Transport Canada supports this view, based on a study that revealed all-season tires are less effective when temperatures drop below -10 Celsius.
Tests conducted by Transport Canada and the Canadian Rubber Association revealed that all-season tires veered off the testing track at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h; this wasn’t a problem with cars with winter tires.
Unlike winter tires, all-season tires don't have the cold weather compounds, tread swipes and channeling tread patterns for traction in deep snow. And although most new vehicles are designed with front-wheel drivetrain, all four tires should be replaced. All tires require linear (forward) traction and lateral (sideways) traction in order to prevent loss of control.
In parts of northern Ontario, the Highways Traffic Act allows the limited use of studded tires between October 1st and April 30th. According to a Government of Ontario website, a study has shown that ""studded tires are more effective than other tires under icy conditions, particularly on wet ice.""
To further persuade drivers to install winter tires, last week the Ontario provincial government announced a plan to help lower auto insurance rates by requiring insurance companies to provide a discount for those drivers who purchase and install winter tires, starting January 1, 2016.
Once you have decided to equip your vehicle with winter tires, here are some tips that will make for safer driving this winter.
1. Install four tires, not two. Transport Canada recommends installing four in order to improve vehicle handling. In short, four tires will optimize the ABS and electronic stability systems.
2. Install winter tires sooner, rather than later, to avoid the rush at service departments after the first snowfall.
3. Winter tires should be removed when the daily average temperature is above 5 C and there is no more risk of snow or frost. Plus, winter tires are not as effective at stopping on dry and wet roads during the summer months.
4. Consider purchasing a separate set of winter-only wheels. Winter wheels provide more flexibility in terms of tire widths - winter tires tend to perform better in narrow sizes and are better at moving through packed snow.
5. Your local new car dealership offers a full selection of winter tires for most makes and models. Don't assume that independent auto retailers are cheaper; dealers buy winter tires in bulk during the summer to be competitive on price, and those tires are in stock now and will sell out fast. Some auto manufacturers are now offering no-charge winter tire packages on top of competitive rebates and finance rates.
6. Ensure that your tires are properly inflated. Tire pressures will decrease as temperatures drop, and checking the inflation once a month is recommended.
7. Store your tires properly. Improper tire storage can lead to damage and can shorten the lifespan of your tires. Many dealerships offer tire storage services at a modest cost.
So, with winter approaching, consider the safety aspect of winter tires. Don't compromise your safety and the safety of your loved ones by driving a vehicle that's less safe than it could be.

0,Dragon Arlene Dickinson’s simple secrets for financial success: Mayers,"Arlene Dickinson is best known as one of the tough-talking, no-nonsense venture capitalist co-hosts of CBC’s Dragon’s Den.
The highly successful businesswoman, who the broadcaster bills as a multi-millionaire, came by her success the hard way. She arrived in Calgary as a three-year-old with her immigrant parents, who were fleeing South Africa for a brighter future in Canada.
“My father and mother wanted us to have a better place to live,” she says. “But we were the typical immigrant family, with five dollars in our pocket. Growing up, we had very little.”
That upbringing has influenced Dickinson’s attitudes toward money, the trappings of material wealth and the things she is trying to pass along to her five grandchildren.
Dickinson left the Den in January after eight seasons, and now shuttles between Calgary, Toronto and a cottage in Collingwood. She runs marketing communications firm Venture Communications, and as a result of her Dragon’s Den experience launched YouInc., which invests in and encourages entrepreneurs.
I asked her about a mistake that taught a memorable lesson and what advice she has for her grandchildren.
Your money mistake is connected to flowers. Can you explain?
Growing up, we had very little, and so buying flowers was an extravagance. I have always loved them, and when I first became successful, I started buying flowers every week for my home. It was something that illustrated to me my success.
But after a while, I asked myself: Why are you doing this every week? The proof of your success should not be in the things you acquire. It should be that your success gives you the ability to do what you want.
So I stopped buying them every week. Flowers are wonderful and I still buy them, but because I love them, not because they prove something.
What is your biggest lesson?
When I was younger, I thought success showed up in certain ways — the home you had, the car you drove, the jewelry you wore, etc. The lesson as I have gotten older — and hopefully wiser — is that material trappings are just that. They trap some of your money and are not what’s important.
My grandma taught me to love people and like things. She’s right. It’s not about accumulating things with your money, but accumulating memories. That doesn’t mean you can’t have nice stuff, you just don’t need a lot of it.
What common mistakes do you see?
People start out with good intentions to save, but get distracted and spend money on the wrong things. Then they get discouraged. It’s like weight loss. You just have to keep at it.
What else do you see?
Many people are afraid to seek advice. They’re afraid to admit they don’t have all the answers and so they end up spending money on the wrong things. A good place to start is your bank.
What advice do you give to your grandchildren?
Take 10 per cent of your allowance, or birthday money, and put it away. As you get older, give another 10 per cent of what you make to charity. Live on the rest.
My oldest grandson is 14 and he learned a good lesson recently. He’s just finished Grade 8 and received some money as gifts. He told me he really wanted an Apple Watch and if he saved 10 per cent of the money he had been given he wouldn’t be able to afford it.
He bought the watch. Two weeks later he told me he regretted it. It was cool, but not really worth the big price tag. He said he’d be more careful next time. It was a good lesson.
The other lesson he’s learned is about how small things add up. We have a deal that he can have all the change he can find in the bottom of my purse. We put it away. At the end of the year he had $600. Even I thought: Holy Cow!
Any concluding thoughts?
Good money management starts with education. You can’t manage what you don’t understand, so become literate about financial matters. Learning the language of money management is a critical lesson for all ages. Ask questions, read a lot, get advice. Study money the same way you study anything you are passionate about. Take control and remember to save. That 10 per cent adds up in a meaningful way.",Soft News,Local News,Toronto Star,08-31-2015,http://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/2015/08/31/dragon-arlene-dickinsons-simple-secrets-for-success-mayers.html,01-05-2016

Lying awake at 2 a.m. on a cold December morning, the high school basketball star, then 17, opened his computer and wrote a note to his parents as they slept down the hall in their Victoria home.
“When I lay in my bed all I can think about is images on and off the court seeing friends humiliated and embarrassed,” he wrote. “I know I will struggle with these feelings for a long time.”
More than two years later, it appears he was right.
Fraser-Brown is one of 13 former student athletes at the prestigious St. Michael’s University School (SMUS) in Victoria who alleged in 2012 that several coaches for both the boys and girls teams routinely bullied and intimidated them with demeaning, profane and sometimes vicious insults that many of them — and their parents — say have had lasting repercussions.
A Toronto Star/CTV W5 investigation has detailed how parents and students squared off against educational officials in a now three-year fight over alleged emotional abuse by teachers — including routinely yelling profanities and epithets such as “retard,” “pussy” and “idiot” — with impunity.

Reviews of emotional abuse allegations by SMUS and the province’s teacher regulation branch, contained in reports that were mostly kept secret, have exonerated the school and its teachers while acknowledging that profanity-laced insults were directed at students by their teacher-coaches.
The debate raised is this: Are young athletes inspired to excel by aggressive and profane name-calling or does it leave them emotionally damaged?
Verbally aggressive coaching is an “epidemic” in youth sports across North America, says sports psychologist and author Dr. Alan Goldberg, who diagnosed Fraser-Brown with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2012 and continues to treat him.
“I get calls every week from parents of athletes in these situations where they’re struggling with abusive coaching,” he says. “SMUS is far from isolated.”
The question left for parents, students and experts involved in sports across the country: Why are coaches — from hot-tempered volunteer hockey parents to licensed teacher-coaches in private schools — permitted to behave in ways that are considered unacceptable in any other context involving impressionable young people?
“While it is unfortunate that certain parents remain dissatisfied with their children’s experience at SMUS, it should be readily apparent that at no time did SMUS teachers or administrators behave in an inappropriate fashion,” reads a statement from the school, provided to the Star and W5 in response to interview requests.
“SMUS and its faculty members have conducted themselves appropriately and in a manner consistent with the values that it practices and seeks to instill into its students: fairness, respect and integrity.”
Allegations of emotionally abusive coaching remain whispered within the lavish, manicured grounds of the Victoria private school that markets itself to B.C.’s affluent families, who pay more than $45,000 a year in fees for boarding students. A big part of the marketing for those students relies on the name and image of its most famous alumnus.

NBA star Steve Nash, who played basketball at the school in the 1990s before ascending to become one of Canada’s greatest sports heroes, remains at the centre of the school’s mythology and recruitment efforts.
When Fraser-Brown first stepped in Nash’s footsteps on SMUS high school basketball courts in Grade 4, he had the skill and drive that distinguished him on the court as one of the school’s best prospects.
But by Grade 10, the coaching he received changed dramatically, he said in an interview.
That’s the year he was introduced to Ian Hyde-Lay, a teacher-coach with a storied reputation enshrined in the 1990s when he coached Nash.
Hyde-Lay is known as an aggressive taskmaster with a deep knowledge of the game who paced the sidelines with a foul mouth and a determined demeanour.
In reviews conducted by the school and province, most students told investigators they supported Hyde-Lay and his coaching colleagues, some calling them “the best coaches they’ve ever had.”
One report quotes a student saying SMUS coaches, “provide encouraging and supportive instruction to help us develop our skills. And sometimes, they may use sharp comments to break through to us, stimulate thinking on the court and bring up the intensity level.”
Others are quoted as having an ambivalent relationship with Hyde-Lay — respecting his knowledge as a coach but questioning his aggressive style.
In video footage, Hyde-Lay can often be seen on the sidelines screaming, cursing and sometimes bowing his head and pulling at his hair.
“The (coach) who is in my face yelling at me and pulling my jersey closer to him is a teacher and is in a position of power over me,” says Fraser-Brown, who has suffered panic attacks, nightmares, sleepwalking and anxiety.
“The coaches were emotionally abusive to a lot of talented young (athletes), who were destroyed by it.”

Fraser-Brown’s mother, Jennifer Fraser, at the time a teacher at the school, gathered testimonies at the request of school headmaster Bob Snowden.
These testimonies contain allegations of aggressive verbal denigration, profanity and scenes of public humiliation during practices, where coaches would call players to stand in front of them while they screamed criticisms at them.
In some cases, students were grabbed and held in place, according to the testimonies.
“These are students who don’t even know each other and they were telling exactly the same story practically,” she says. “Year after year after year this is happening.”
During one game, Fraser and her husband witnessed their son, who had made a mistake on the court, being grabbed by the jersey by coach Reagan Daly, who held him to his face and screamed, she says.
“‘Don’t walk away from me when I’m f---ing talking to you,’” Fraser recalls the coach yelling. “All the parents heard it. Everyone in the back wall heard it.”
She says she was stunned that he faced no disciplinary action by SMUS.
“I would be disciplined, fired,” she says. “I’ve never heard of a teacher ever at that school who speaks to students in that way in a classroom.”
All requests to interview the school’s coaches were denied by SMUS.
Colton Stockus, Fraser-Brown’s friend, was also his teammate in Grade 10.
“My final years playing basketball were terrible,” says Stockus. “I was playing with fear all the time. It was brutal.”

The beginning of the end of Stockus’s high school basketball career happened during a 2011 practice when he took a shot and missed — a memory he recalls with detailed precision.
“My coach at the time, he blew his whistle and he gathered the whole team around and he said, ‘Let’s face it guys, Colton’s the worst shooter on the team, don’t pass it to him,’ in front of everybody.”
He left the team after Grade 10 and returned as a team manager the following year to stay close with his friends.
By Grade 12, Stockus and Fraser-Brown had quit the game they once loved.
Fraser-Brown has never played again. He has been in therapy for PTSD ever since — a condition that is surprisingly common for competitive young athletes, says Goldberg.
Stockus says the coaching impacted him deeply. While once a social kid, he started keeping to himself, struggling with his moods and feeling anxious.
While he has recently started playing basketball informally with pals at Ryerson, Hyde-Lay’s voice still rings in his head, he says.
“I can still hear his voice in my head saying I’m not good enough. I still get anxious. I have big trust issues. It’s unpleasant to think that there are new kids there now going through the same things.”
Stockus’s father, George, says he has also seen troubling changes in his son.
“My son internalizes things and doesn’t want to emote. It’s one of the most painful things to see.”
His older child, Sydney, had stress levels during her athletic career at SMUS and returned home after games in tears. She had anxiety and trouble sleeping. And it stayed with her.
She had to temporarily abandon her studies in her freshman year at the University of Southern California, because of ongoing emotional issues stemming from SMUS coaching, she says.
“Thinking back to what I experienced in the basketball program and what I’ve seen transpire at SMUS, my eyes are very open to the lasting marks these coaches have had not only on parts of my psyche, but my family’s,” she says. “Now, as a graduate and young professional, I still catch myself and need to remind myself that my best is good enough despite these memories of being conditioned otherwise.”
She has only picked up a basketball once since high school, she says.
George Stockus’s worries about the long-term mental health of his children are compounded by the $25,000 he donated to SMUS to build the basketball gym.
“I didn’t know I was donating to the house of shout,” he says. “If you have a government that doesn’t have an interest in holding a school accountable and a school that doesn’t want to be held accountable, nothing happens.”
Yelling profanity-laced insults at students may be a firing offence for teachers in a classroom, but in a school gym teachers are mistakenly celebrated as inspirational figures, says Goldberg, a Massachusetts-based sports psychologist and one of the continent’s leading experts in his field.
“When kids are abused, and they’re not protected, and it goes on for an extended amount of time, they end up being traumatized by it,” says Goldberg, who was invited by B.C.’s Representative for Children and Youth to speak about coach abuse at a 2013 conference.
“They memorize those experiences — the images, the emotion, the anxiety attached to it, the thinking that is associated with it — that will stay in their system. And it can have lasting implications on vulnerable young people for years to come.”
In May 2011, a parent and lawyer named Patricia Lane, whose son played basketball at SMUS, wrote a complaint and gave it to a member of the school’s board of directors.
“Here is the secret,” reads the complaint, obtained by the Star and W5. “There is child abuse occurring routinely in the form of severe teacher bullying in the high school basketball department. It is now an accepted part of the culture.”
Lane declined to be interviewed for this article.
In February 2012, the father of two SMUS students sent a scathing letter to school administrators detailing how they have lost confidence and joy in the game they love “due to the insults, ridicule and expressions of rage” from Hyde-Lay.
“Quite simply, Ian Hyde-Lay is a bully and should not hold a position of power over a group of adolescent boys. He swears at the boys . . . screams at them throughout games for what he perceives as their ineptitude, and rages over their inability to please him.”
The complaint letter prompted a written response from Hyde-Lay himself.
“I freely admit I am competitive to a fault, with my burning desire for the team to perform well and win too often resulting in outbursts I wish I could take back,” reads his email response, obtained by the Star. “I need to do a far better job controlling my frustration when mistakes or lack of effort take place.”
He also says his critics ignore the “literally thousands of extra hours I spend with all our players in and out of season to assist them in playing a sport they love,” and that “I reinforce to the boys on every possible occasion the values of loyalty, teamwork, humour, unselfishness and honesty.”
By the spring of 2012, complaints were intensifying, internal correspondence shows.
“Nepotism, favoritism, neglect and abuse run rampant,” one couple wrote to school officials listing, “incessant yelling, name calling, public shaming and favoritism” by basketball coaches.
Fraser and her husband, Tom Brown, also complained.
Headmaster Robert Snowden’s initial response acknowledged deep concerns about his coaches.
“The first thing I do want to reassure you about is that things will change for next year, and we will do our best to make sure that the boys’ basketball experience is as positive as possible, with different coaching,” he wrote in an April 4, 2012, email to Fraser and her husband. “The most important thing is to do what is right by the students.”
By May, the school was apparently considering placing Hyde-Lay on probation.
Snowden told one parent that he is “working on a program” for Hyde-Lay that will help him “examine his approach to coaching and address the issues that have arisen.”
In a written statement to the Star and W5, Snowden says he took the allegations to the Saanich Police Department in May 2012.
The police determined, says the statement, “that this was not a police matter, as none of the elements for a criminal charge were made out.”
In a police occurrence report, obtained by the Star, the investigating officer wrote, “If the allegations were brought forward, it was bordering on criminal harassment.”
In June 2012, Snowden sent an email calling players and parents to a meeting to discuss complaints about “the negative experience of a number of boys” on the basketball team, the invitation read.
It appeared to be a step toward acknowledgement and change, Montgomery recalls: “The headmaster was going to apologize for the coaching conduct and, you know, offer a resolution of sorts.”
But staff members felt they had not had a fair hearing.
The evening before the public meeting, Snowden, in an email exchange with Lane, wrote “I am afraid we are at a serious impasse.”
The next day, the school chapel filled with players and parents to address the allegations openly. Snowden announced he would launch an independent investigation and conduct a review of the athletic department.
Then, a parent asked that anyone who supported the coaches raise a hand, say several witnesses interviewed.
“A lot of kids raised their hands and me and Colton and a few others sat there with our hands down and so everyone stared at us,” Montgomery recalls.
The boys were publicly outed to the entire school community as whistleblowers, they say.
Word spread quickly among the faculty about the identity of the complainers.
Colton Stockus says high school, for him, became a survival exercise: Glares, cheap-shot comments, and even faculty taunting.
Fraser-Brown suffered panic attacks in class and was forced to drop some.
“I wasn’t able to write exams in grades 11 or 12 and I pretty much didn’t really learn anything,” he says. “I constantly felt threatened, scared about walking through a corridor and seeing my coaches or other teachers glaring at me.”

Snowden, meanwhile, commissioned two separate reports into the allegations.
The school didn’t share the first report conducted by the ombudsman of independent schools, Robert Ellis, with the Star and W5.
But a summary of the findings, obtained by the news organizations, says Ellis could make no clear findings given the two conflicting accounts.
In the second review, Vancouver lawyer John Sanderson, quoting anonymous students who said those criticizing the coaches were spreading “nasty lies” and attempting to “manufacture evidence of abuse,” concluded that while coaches “openly cursed,” he found, “there were no behaviours that were deliberately abusive or demeaning.”
The divide between the majority of the 35 students he interviewed who supported the coaches and those who were critical, he wrote, was rooted in differing abilities to transition into more serious high school competition.
“For some players, what was a fun game in which they could fully compete with their teammates and others, has become an increasingly demanding burden on their ego and self-confidence.”
He recommended no disciplinary action against the teachers but did suggest a need to “review and reconsider behaviour” of coaches, saying they, “must set a positive and better example for the players and they should curb the use of foul language.” He also recommended a coaching code of conduct be created for the school.
Goldberg, who reviewed the findings, wrote a report saying Sanderson “explained away” emotionally abusive treatment of players as “coaching passion.”
“In my experience … athletes do not complain about the adjustment to a higher level. Playing basketball is their dream. They do not write testimonials blaming the coaches if they are having trouble or don’t have enough playing time. They do not risk the wrath of the coaches, their fellow players or the student body. If a group of athletes have gotten to the point of launching a formal complaint, there is a good reason for it and I am deeply concerned and dismayed that Mr. Sanderson completely minimized and explained away their complaints of emotional abuse.”
Sanderson declined to be interviewed for this story. In a written statement, he said: “My report was based solely on the facts given to me by the athletes themselves in lengthy and private interviews with each of them … I am confident in the accuracy of my report.”
One of the dozen players who provided testimony and says she suffered on the girls team calls Sanderson’s findings offensive.
“I’ve had the toughest of tough coaches and I think there’s nothing wrong with that,” says the athlete, who now attends university in Ontario and asked not to be identified for fear that speaking out could compromise her acceptance into an academic program. “I can see the difference between that and being tormented. I was completely trapped.”
Troubled by Sanderson’s conclusions, several parents turned to the B.C. Teacher Regulation Branch, responsible for overseeing the conduct of the profession. Jennifer Fraser filed the complaint on behalf of a group of parents.
Bruce Preston, a retired judge appointed as commissioner of the oversight body, authored the final rulings in April 2014 — nearly two years after the investigation began.
The findings aren’t public. Fraser says she is prevented from discussing the results for fear of losing her teaching licence.
SMUS officials provided the Star and W5 with redacted versions of the report that show Preston dismissed complaints against four teachers. While he acknowledges the concerns, he concludes they are outweighed by the positive statements of other players.
(Mobile users, tap here to read findings about Ian Hyde-Lay.)
Uncensored copies of those decisions, obtained by the Star and W5, reveal specific allegations presented to Preston including coaches yelling comments such as “What the f--- are you doing?’ ‘You are all f---ing terrible’ and ‘You are a f---ing idiot.’” Hyde-Lay himself, according to Preston’s uncensored decision, was alleged to have yelled “f---ing retards” and “f---ing pussies” at players.
Preston concluded: “Mr. Hyde-Lay has used obscenities … and that the use of profanity in a school setting is inappropriate conduct.” But Preston decided a disciplinary panel, if asked to review the evidence, would not find professional misconduct because “the swearing was not intended to be heard by students.”
Preston declined the Star’s repeated requests for an interview.
Two months after the decision last year, Hyde-Lay was awarded “coach of the year” in B.C. by readers of the Vancouver Province, described by one columnist as “the perfect combination of the fiery and the cerebral.”
While SMUS denies any wrongdoing by its coaches in response to the Star/W5 investigation, it recently introduced a new code of conduct for all of its coaches.
“SMUS Coaches operate in an environment of mutual respect, and treat their athletes in a manner that fosters this climate,” it reads. “Coaches’ language, in-game demeanour, and overall decorum should reflect the types of behaviours we aspire to see in our athletes.”
Meanwhile, Fraser has filed a complaint against Preston to the B.C. Ombudsperson, alleging his lack of action has “re-victimized students already bullied.”
She says her choice to become a whistleblower made her employment at the school untenable. She left on her own terms, she says.
“They made it so unbearable for me to go to work every day.”
Lane has requested a judicial inquiry into the handling of the complaints by Preston.
“The alarming result of the current situation is that high school student athletes in BC are significantly less safe than they were before Judge Preston made these decisions,” it reads.
Neither Colton Stockus nor Montgomery Fraser-Brown attended their graduation ceremony at SMUS.
“I wasn’t sure if any kid was going to yell anything on stage and embarrass and I also refused to shake the headmaster’s hand after everything I went through,” says Stockus, who left Victoria for university.
Fraser-Brown, now a freshman at the University of Oregon, also skipped the ceremony, afraid that he would hear the word “pussy” yelled at him as he crossed the stage.
“This whole situation has … really changed everything in my life,” he says. “I always wanted to go to UBC, where my family went, but I had to escape SMUS. I had to escape the grasp of SMUS … I no longer wanted to be known as a pussy and a liar and a faggot. I wanted to just be Monty.”
Lying awake early one morning last month, he wrote again to his parents: “With physical abuse you can show a bruise but with psychological abuse it’s a bruise that goes unnoticed. I feel like people’s response will be, ‘Oh just some coaches yelling, so what,’ but what really happened is something I can’t even describe or put into words.”
The psychological impacts are compounded, he told the Star, by the fact that he and his teammates took the step of speaking out about the abuse they felt they were suffering, only to be called “liars.”
“In no way is it over,” he says. “I contemplate and deal with the repercussions every day and it’s something I’ll deal with for the rest of my life.”",Soft News,Local News,Toronto Star,03-14-2015,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/03/14/teachers-bullying-scarred-us-say-student-athletes.print.html,01-05-2016
1,Extension Cord On Stage Steals Spotlight From Jeb Bush During Campaign Rally,"CONCORD, NH—Emphasizing the allure and appeal of the 30-foot length of electrical power cable that shared the stage with the former Florida governor, sources confirmed that an orange three-pronged extension cord completely stole the spotlight from Jeb Bush during a New Hampshire campaign rally Friday. “Jeb made some interesting points about the need to prioritize national security, but ultimately he was just completely overshadowed by the far more riveting extension cord running along the floor beside him,” said political pundit Chris Wallace, who acknowledged that attendees appeared more energized by the flexible orange cable taped to the stage and noted that the one-time GOP frontrunner repeatedly failed to connect with the audience as effectively as the cord. “Unfortunately for Jeb, no matter what he did throughout the night, he just looked bland and flat compared to that extension cord. He’s not going to want to bring that piece of electrical equipment with him to any more rallies if he wants voters’ attention to stay directed at him.” At press time, the Bush campaign team was rapidly assembling a focus group to learn how the candidate could be more like the extension cord.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Onion,09-18-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/extension-cord-stage-steals-spotlight-jeb-bush-dur-51343,09-29-2015
1,GOP Promotes Carly Fiorina To Male Candidate After Strong Debate Showing,"WASHINGTON—Saying she had proven herself to be a formidable contender worthy of respect, GOP leaders announced Thursday that Carly Fiorina had been officially promoted to a male candidate after her strong showing in last night’s primary debate. “Given her steady rise in the polls and her consistent performance on the national stage, we have determined that Ms. Fiorina’s skills as a speaker and compelling ideas about foreign and domestic policy merit her recognition as male,” said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, adding that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO had impressed GOP officials with her breadth of knowledge, her confidence, and her ability to doggedly attack both Democrats and her primary opponents, and therefore deserved to have the label of “female” removed entirely. “We are pleased to be able to offer Ms. Fiorina the increased respect and media coverage that come with being a male candidate. Allow me to be the first to congratulate him and say that he has certainly earned it.” Priebus added that the committee was still reviewing Marco Rubio’s performance, but was strongly considering promoting him to white.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Onion,09-17-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/gop-promotes-carly-fiorina-male-candidate-after-st-51331,09-29-2015

1,Voters Look On In Horror As 3 New Republican Candidates Appear In Place Of Scott Walker,"MADISON, WI—Overcome by a profound feeling of dread and helplessness as the GOP field multiplied before their eyes, voters at Scott Walker’s press conference yesterday, in which the Wisconsin governor announced he was exiting the presidential race, reportedly looked on in horror as three new Republican contenders appeared on stage in place of the former candidate. “The moment Scott Walker said he was suspending his campaign, there they were, smiling and waving to the crowd—it was incredibly frightening,” said local resident Jordan Ottinger, who recalled the wave of terrified gasps that washed over the room when those in attendance began to realize that the clean-cut middle-aged men in suits who suddenly showed up behind Walker were each accompanied by a full staff of aides and supporters holding campaign signs. “They just materialized, fully formed and already talking about conservative values. The scariest thing is that Walker was clearly defeated, but these candidates look fresh and strong, like they might have enough money and support to keep campaigning all the way to the primaries. My God, what do we do?” Sources confirmed that the crowd then began screaming and scattered in fear as the three new candidates descended from the dais and attempted to shake their hands.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Onion,09-22-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/voters-look-horror-3-new-republican-candidates-app-51366,09-29-2015
1,Campaign Staffers Making Progress Conditioning Hillary Clinton To Replicate Emotions,"BROOKLYN, NY—After several months of diligent effort, staff members working on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign confirmed Wednesday they have made significant progress in conditioning her to convincingly recreate and convey a limited spectrum of emotions.

According to aides who drill the Democratic frontrunner for several hours each day on her emotional responses to a variety of stimuli, Clinton can now effectively exhibit concern, mild excitement, and incredulity. Intensive training is reportedly still underway on some of the more challenging-to-produce emotions, such as polite interest and personal warmth.

“The headway Hillary has made is really encouraging, especially when you consider what we started with,” said staffer Cheryl Dumás, who later added that when she began working with Clinton, the candidate was only able to fluctuate between stony neutrality and terrifying anger. “We’re very proud that she can now display a virtually indistinguishable facsimile of empathy. It’s the result of a behavioral modification technique in which we rigorously reinforce any approximations of compassion that happen to flash across her face while she listens to the concerns of voters.”

“We’re hopeful that she’ll have a functional range of 11 or even 12 emotions by the time the early primaries roll around,” Dumás added.

In her current program of operant conditioning, Clinton is reportedly shown a series of images—such as a widow crying at her spouse’s funeral, a family opening presents on Christmas morning, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich—designed to induce specific emotional responses, and depending on the appropriateness of her subsequent facial expressions and other body language, she is either rewarded or punished.

Staffers said they began the process by slowly and painstakingly pairing a correct reaction with a correct stimulus. They reportedly first trained the former secretary of state to reproduce a “happy” emotion by repeatedly showing her a photo of a small child playing with a kitten and then rubbing a soft cloth on her face while physically holding her mouth in the shape of a smile until, eventually, she could display a passable simulacrum of joy.

“There are definitely some crossed wires, like how she nods and applauds after hearing the story of a family that lost their home to foreclosure,” campaign consultant Allison Stevens said. “But it’s just a matter of time and patience. When she gets a response wrong, we spritz her in the face with cold water from a spray bottle, and when she gets one right, we let her work on her memoirs for a little bit or call her ‘Madam President’ in soothing tones—she loves that.”

“She also really likes Luna Bars,” Stevens continued. “She’ll do just about anything for a Luna Bar!”

Staff members acknowledged that Clinton would be subject to extremely rapid regression if she were not conditioned with absolute consistency. They told reporters they didn’t want her to go back to the days when people she met on the campaign trail would voice their deepest worries and she would respond to each by loudly stating, “I am feeling empathy toward you.”

“There have definitely been some setbacks,” senior aide Tim Balducci said. “Yesterday, when a reporter asked for her thoughts on the surge in refugees crossing the Mediterranean, she panicked and rapidly cycled through the eight or so responses we’d equipped her with thus far before making a painfully stilted reply. We really hope to get that ironed out before the first debate next month.”

Other campaigns have taken note of Clinton’s progress and implemented similar programs, with Chris Christie’s staffers reporting this week that they have already had some limited success in training the New Jersey governor not to bite people or defecate on the floor.",Politics/Civics,Elections/Debates,Onion,09-16-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/campaign-staffers-making-progress-conditioning-hil-51320,09-29-2015
1,Maury leaders debate entertains studio audience,"TORONTO -- Last night on a special Canadian political episode of the Maury Povich Show, three men all claimed that they love Canada and know what’s best for it, but only one can win its heart.

The first appearance was made by Tom, a man who claims Canada’s current lover, Steve, gets in too many fights with other leaders and embarrasses Canada quite frequently.

“He gets into battles he can’t win and it’s always ends with complications,” explained Tom about Steve’s habit of trying to be macho and flexing his military muscles. “I’ll be the man that’s better for Canada and treat it right.”

But Steve had a different story. He says that Tom isn’t man enough to handle Canada and would not be willing to stand up for it during a time of need.

“Look, Tom is just chasing rumours,” Steve retorted. “There’s a lot of dangerous people out there who need to be bombed.” 

In a twist, a third man, Justin, believes Tom and Steve don’t actually love Canada and that he wants a long-term relationship and is willing to dish out the cash to make that happen. He immediately went after his competitors with stinging accusations.

“Tom once tried to export precious natural resources from his previous partner, Quebec, just before they broke up,” Justin told the audience and millions of Maury viewers. 

“You’re a liar, you lying liar!” retorted Tom in anger.

Audience members also participated with laughter, booing and timely ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ with every sassy and snappy one-liner.

But the most heated exchange came when Tom attacked Justin’s father, Pierre, for cheating on Canada’s individual rights.

“You don’t talk about my daddy like that!” Justin shouted while nearly throwing the podium and running back stage with cameras in pursuit. 

“My father was a saint and I am very proud of what he did,” said a teary-eyed Justin.

1,Report: Increase In Gun Sales To Be Most Concrete Result Of Obama’s Pro-Gun-Control Speech,"WASHINGTON—Researchers at the Urban Institute published a study Friday confirming that a sharp increase in gun sales nationwide would be the most concrete result of the impassioned pro-gun-control speech that President Obama delivered following yesterday’s mass shooting in Oregon. “According to our analysis, by far the most tangible impact of the president emotionally urging the nation to consider how their votes can prevent mass shootings like this will be a 17 percent spike in revenue for firearm vendors across the U.S.,” said report co-author Kyle Bieler, who found a direct link between the estimated $58 million uptick in gun sales over the next month and Obama’s use of the phrases “common-sense legislation,” “only advanced country,” and “not enough.” “The portion of the president’s remarks in which he asked for support from state legislatures and governors will, based on our projections, nearly double the number of sidearm purchases this year. Beyond that, the only other material change that is likely to result from Obama calling on elected officials and everyday citizens to work together to reduce gun violence will be the purchase of roughly 100 million rounds of ammunition.” Bieler noted that the president’s support for responsible gun ownership will likely have no impact on sales, as Americans would have likely already walked out of their front door, started their car, and driven to their nearest gun store long before that point in the speech.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Onion,10-02-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/report-increase-gun-sales-be-most-concrete-result--51456,10-06-2015

1,New Law Determines Bullets No Longer Responsibility Of Owner Once Fired From Gun,"PHOENIX—In an attempt to clarify the rights and obligations of those possessing firearms, the Arizona State Legislature approved a new law Wednesday declaring that a gun owner ceases to be responsible for a bullet once it has been fired from a weapon. “It simply makes no sense to hold people accountable for a round of ammunition that is no longer inside their gun, and this legislation clears this up once and for all,” said bill co-sponsor Sen. Steve Smith (R-Maricopa), observing that no one can reasonably expect an individual to exert control over a bullet or a bullet’s ultimate whereabouts once it has exited a gun’s barrel. “How can you be liable for a projectile that may be lodged as far as 5,000 feet away from where you’re standing? That’s ridiculous. Now, if we’re talking about ammunition that’s in the chamber of a gun you’re holding, or in your holster, or in a bandolier worn around the shoulder, then yes, it is still the carrier’s responsibility. But it’s unfair to penalize citizens for bullets that are not in their possession anymore.” Smith went on to state that as soon as a round enters someone’s thoracic cavity, that person immediately takes possession of the bullet and must assume full responsibility for it.",Politics/Civics,Gun Violence,Onion,06-10-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/new-law-determines-bullets-no-longer-responsibilit-50623,10-06-2015

“After the first one this year we were all shocked by how random it was,” said NRA head Wayne LaPierre. “But by the 100th one we were really shocked by the randomness. It’s like, how many more times can these random, unstoppable events happen before our luck turns?”

Some have wondered if we haven’t explored every possibility, that there could possibly be something linking these shootings that might help prevent future attacks.

“As far as we know, there’s no explanation,” said National Rifle Association statistician Lloyd Phillips. “I’ve tried correlating the shootings with everything you can imagine - dog ownership, the decline of “Frank” as a baby name, how awesome the US is - and I can’t find a single reason why these attacks keep happening. As terrifying as it is, I guess we just have to accept that they’re random.”

Adding to the horror and confusion is the realization that mass-shootings seem to only occur in America.

“That does seem crazy, doesn’t it?” said Phillips. “And I just can’t see- wait a second… We take in a lot of immigrants and refugees don’t we?

1,World Leaders march in Paris to defend their exclusive right to suppress journalists,"PARIS – Dozens of World Leaders joined yesterday’s Charlie Hebdo solidarity march to send a message to terrorists that intimidation of media will not be tolerated, unless they are the ones doing it.

More than 1.6 million French citizens joined the Paris march held Sunday, including many world leaders who disagreed with the silencing of journalists by anyone but themselves. Among them was Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister Ramtane Lamara, who commented on the well-attended march. “This turnout is very impressive,” remarked Lamara, “Good thing we’ve strictly outlawed such protests back home!”

Though many of today’s world leaders hail from countries where freedom of the press is restricted or severely undermined by either legislation or implied threats, they nonetheless expressed outrage at the violent attack last week on France’s satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine.

“I mean, on one hand it’s an inexcusable atrocity,” said Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu of Turkey, which imprisons more journalists than any other country. “But on the other hand, that’s kind of our racket. Watch it.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was also quick to criticize religious extremists who attacked cartoonists in Paris last week. “They’re not even doing it right,” lamented Lavrov, adding “This June President Putin had five journalists detained indefinitely just for protesting too loudly.” He continued, “He wouldn’t have even broken a sweat, except that he was wrestling two grizzly bears at the time.”

“Amateurs,” Added Lavrov.

As the march continued, French President Francois Hollande spoke firmly about the importance of a free press, in spite of France’s anti-privacy laws that severely limit the investigation of political corruption. “I thank the many leaders, and underlings of leaders, who have come here today to stand united and say to those who would bully, silence, or harm our press – step the fuck off our turf.”

“It’s okay folks; the plotters had no association to Islam,” reassured the local RCMP to a visibly nervous media and public. “No one converted either. These were just disgruntled caucasian kids who wanted to commit mass atrocities based on white supremacy. The plot was not culturally based whatsoever. It’s just a phase and not terrorism.”

The RCMP stated that the suspects had no names like 'Mohammed' or went to a mosque on a weekly basis. Instead, they were just neighbourhood kids fantasizing about how Adolf Hitler killed millions of people based on their race and wanted to do the same. 

Furthermore, the blogs the suspects read and used had no association with ISIS, but instead called for death and destruction based on a hate-filled, fringe ideology, which is, apparently, not as bad as the legal definition terrorism.

1,Serial killer just 200 victims away from being national hero,"IRAQ - Personally and individually responsible for the painful deaths of more than a hundred human beings, Sgt. Jeff Grenner is over a third of the way to being a national hero.

“I never got into this for the fame and fortune,” said Grenner. “I’m just a simple man with a passion for hurting things who followed his bliss.”

“It was this or investment banking, and I’m not that good with numbers.”

Already winner of the purple heart, the shootsgood star and the lack of affect medal, Grenner has also recently been awarded the trophy for prolonged eye-contact and heavy breathing.

For all his humility, Grenner has already used enough high-velocity pieces of lead to rupture the internal organs of enough mostly random people to be considered a hero in his home state.

“I want to grow up to be just like Sgt. Grenner,” said 10-year old James Brook, skinning a live cat in the barn near his house. “I just hope that the business and political elites of the time manufacture an excuse for me to unleash my inner horrors onto innocent people as well.”

“Oh, who am I kidding, we’ll still be in Iraq.”

For all his martial prowess, Grenner is also respected for his philanthropic work. When not on tour of duty, he runs a charity where he finds homes for isolated, undocumented immigrants who are never heard from again because of how happy they are in their new lives.

“I thought for sure we’d killed off the concept of humour,” said one gunman to another in their safehouse. “I can’t believe people are still making fun of us!”

Despite their brutal and heartless assault on the writers at Charlie Hebdo, all forms of satire - from ‘knock-knock’ jokes and stand-up to sketch shows and even fake news publications - are still being made by millions all across the world.

“We tried firebombing it, shooting at it, stabbing it, but nothing seems to work,” said the getaway driver. “It’s as if satire lives within all of us, an unquenchable flame devoted to producing merriment in times of great tragedy.”

“If only people who were easily offended could shoot whoever they wanted, we’d live in a much safer world,” added the first gunman while sirens could be heard closing in on the hideout.

1,Toronto Blue Jays fans eager to end 22-year rioting drought,"TORONTO - After a two decade playoff absence fans of the Toronto Blue Jays are hopeful this will be the year they can finally destroy their city in a drunken World Series celebration.

“I was there in 1993,” said self-professed Jays superfan Carly Templeton. “My dad brought me to the game, and one of my fondest memories was of him getting a bat signed by Joe Carter, which we then used to destroy windows all along Front Street.” Templeton then produced the heirloom bat, showing the Carter signature, and the gouges from the various mailboxes they’d wailed on together. 

Templeton added wistfully, “I just hope my daughter is old enough to appreciate this, and to throw a molotov cocktail.”

With Toronto failing to make the playoffs for 22 straight years - the longest such drought in professional sports - psychologists estimate that the pent up “psychic energy” could be enough to destroy a significant portion of the downtown area, or roughly the equivalent to one World Cup qualifying match. 

The Twitter hashtag #JaysRiot2015 has already begun trending locally, with fans speculating as to what they’ll destroy should Toronto win the World Series. Suggestions included “I’m going to ripley’s aquarium to free all the fish” and “let’s tip over trains at the steamwhistle brewery”. Another hopeful fan also pointed out, “Back in 92, there weren’t even any condo windows to smash!”

Even at City Hall, the so-called “rioticipation” is growing. “All of Toronto loves the Blue Jays, almost as much as they love rioting,” said Toronto Mayor John Tory. “I myself am more of a hockey fan, but who knows if the Leafs will ever give me an excuse to flip a cop car? Probably not in my lifetime.”

Tory then grabbed his ceremonial mayoral crowbar before adding, “GO JAYS! WOO!”

Not wanting to miss out on the excitement, Rogers has announced a line of specially-made riot supplies, which will be sold at the Rogers Centre during Blue Jays playoff games. Each of the officially-licensed clubs, lighters, and face-concealing bandanas will feature a prominent Rogers logo, and scannable barcode leading customers to the Rogers website.

1,PAN AM UPDATE: CANADA WINS GREEN IN WATER HOCKEY,"TORONTO - After a breathtaking match against Suriname, the Canadian water hockey team has surged to victory, claiming Canada’s first green ribbon in the 2015 Pan Am Games.

“We went out there, we gave it 110 percent, and we left it all on the half-submerged field,” said starting point forward, Terrence Nicholson. “The fact that we were able to beat the Surinamese at this, their national game, says a lot about how far this team has come.”

The news comes as a relief to team Canada fans, who were rocked earlier in the week by St. Lucia’s surprise victory in Low-Hoop, and the Canadians’ disappointing mauve-ribbon finish.

“We were worried in the first fifth, when Suriname was up by six and had possession of the flag,” said defence winger Chuck Vallery. “But when our guys set aside their differences and just focused on throwing the giant inflatable puck over the nets and into those corner pockets, things really started to come together.”

Vallery went on to say he was sure that canuck gumption would help Canada down into the inverse-podium for crawl polo, quintuples tennis, and jask, as well.

“This thrilling match just goes to show that the Pan Am games are just as good and interesting as the Olympics,” said Pan Am spokesperson Monica Alvares. “Where else can you see an entire hemisphere gathered into one city in the name of sport?”

“Other than at the Olympics and the World Cup and a couple of other things?”

As the drama of the games heightens, hundreds of thousands of people have flooded into the city of Toronto, coming from nations as diverse as Belize, San Caymador, The Benedict Islands, and Quebec.

“I’m overjoyed that Torontonians have gotten so into the spirit of these games,” said Mayor John Tory. “If they hadn’t, I probably would have been a real bitch about it.”

1,"Health Experts Recommend Standing Up At Desk, Leaving Office, Never Coming Back","ROCHESTER, MN—In an effort to help working individuals improve their fitness and well-being, experts at the Mayo Clinic issued a new set of health guidelines Thursday recommending that Americans stand up at their desk, leave their office, and never return. “Many Americans spend a minimum of eight hours per day sitting in an office, but we observed significant physical and mental health benefits in subjects after just one instance of standing up, walking out the door, and never coming back to their place of work again,” said researcher Claudine Sparks, who explained that those who implemented the practice in their lives reported an improvement in mood and reduced stress that lasted for the remainder of the day, and which appeared to persist even into subsequent weeks. “We encourage Americans to experiment with stretching their legs by strolling across their office and leaving all their responsibilities behind forever just one time to see how much better they feel. People tend to become more productive, motivated, and happy almost immediately. We found that you can also really get the blood flowing by pairing this activity with hurling your staff ID across the parking lot.” Sparks added that Americans could maximize positive effects by using their lunch break to walk until nothing looks familiar anymore and your old life is a distant memory.",Health/Science,Health,Onion,02-06-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/health-experts-recommend-standing-up-at-desk-leavi-37957,10-20-2015
1,Study Finds Majority Of Deaths Caused By Failure To Heed Omens,"GENEVA—Explaining that simply identifying the phenomena can significantly reduce the risk of early mortality, the World Health Organization released a study Wednesday revealing that the vast majority of deaths worldwide are caused by a failure to heed omens.

Researchers, who analyzed worldwide mortality data from 1980 to 2014, reportedly discovered that disregarding ominous signs, portentous dreams, and other harbingers of darkness accounted for over 38 million deaths each year. According to the study, failing to take notice of prophetic signs of one’s end was the largest contributing factor to fatalities in every geographic region and socioeconomic demographic.

“We’ve found that as many as 95 percent of people who’ve witnessed dark portents could have survived if they had taken the simple step of paying attention to the forewarnings of their impending doom and acted accordingly,” said WHO coordinator for public health Dr. Alex Kazberouk while presenting images of spilled salt, a white moth attempting to enter a home, six crows, and other commonly dismissed omens. “Prompt recognition of a presage is crucial. Individuals can greatly increase their life expectancy by responding with prayers and sacrifices or exposing the source of the omen to strip away its power.”

“Unfortunately, regardless of age, sex, or race, those who clearly see signs of their looming demise often neglect to take basic precautions, such as wearing a necklace of amber or carrying an acorn,” Kazberouk added.

“If we’ve learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics, it’s that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night, you need to immediately kill and bury a bird, then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles.”
An analysis of health records revealed that of the 2.5 million individuals who died in the United States last year, a full 50 percent reportedly saw a woman in white, a raven with a broken neck in the middle of a footpath, or other augury at some point in their lives. In addition, roughly a quarter of the deceased had reportedly dreamed about multiple moons, drowning in mud, or a thorny tree sprouting from their heart, yet took no preventative action upon waking.

WHO officials told reporters that properly identifying a portent of death and immediately visiting a local shaman dramatically reduced the impact of omens, especially if individuals combined the practice with regularly ringing a bell to ward off evil spirits.

The study also confirmed that even after experiencing an unmistakable and foreboding premonition, such as an owl appearing in the daylight, nine out of every 10 people failed to carry out even the most routine measures to subdue the unhallowed forces surrounding them by burning a tin of sage and sweetgrass in the center of a room in which they eat and drink.

“If we’ve learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics, it’s that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night, you need to immediately kill and bury a bird, then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles,” National Institute of Health director Francis Collins told reporters, adding that younger men in particular shouldn’t take their safety for granted if the crone suddenly disappears into the fog of night. “In the morning, go back and sprinkle smoldering ashes on the bird’s gravesite, then stomp three times with bare feet to vanquish fire with flesh.”

“Everyone sees the omens, but how you react will make all the difference,” Collins added. “You can live a long, healthy life in the presence of these omens if you just take the necessary steps and incant the names of the four directions every day.”

Researchers were careful to note that as with all studies on mortality, there are notable exceptions to the rules, such as the rare case of a 104-year-old Japanese woman who has dreamed of her skin peeling away every year since 1950, yet has refused to rub a brown egg on her body. The health experts warned that in the vast majority of cases, however, individuals who fail to heed the dire signs of ruination are essentially writing their own death sentences.

“Above all, people need to know that early detection is the key to preventing omen-foretold deaths,” said researcher John Oakey of Washington University at St. Louis, noting that teenagers should begin purifying their bodies upon the first sign of hearing horse hooves where no such beast exists. “In the meantime, the best we can do is continue to fund research, educate the public, and remind people to seek help as soon as they see a phantom dog with fire-red eyes.”",Health/Science,Health,Onion,03-18-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/study-finds-majority-of-deaths-caused-by-failure-t-38246,10-20-2015
1,Study Finds Those With Deceased Family Members At High Risk Of Dying Themselves,"BOSTON—Pinpointing the phenomenon as the single greatest predictor of human mortality, a paper published Wednesday in The New England Journal Of Medicine has found that people with deceased family members run an extremely high risk of dying themselves.

The groundbreaking study, which tracked the health and well-being of 85,000 subjects over a period of 40 years, discovered that people who have one or more relatives who have passed away are very likely, one day, to die as well.

“It appears that individuals with a family history of death have a strong genetic predisposition toward dying,” said the paper’s lead author, Dr. Samantha Booth, who explained that the finding held true regardless of a subject’s race, nationality, gender, or socioeconomic status. “Based on anecdotal evidence, we’ve long suspected an inherited trait could play a major role in determining whether a person dies, but we were surprised to see just how strong the correlation truly is.”

“Unfortunately, for members of this cohort, death appears to be all but inevitable,” she continued.

According to the study’s authors, the likelihood of future mortality remains high regardless of whether one’s immediate family members have died, or whether only more distant relations have passed on. Based on their findings, researchers hypothesize that death is handed down through individual lineages, becoming a devastating family curse that is passed from parent to child and which tends not to skip a generation.

In addition, a separate study of some 8,000 individuals who died in the Hartford, CT area found that every one of the deceased had ancestors who had died before them, further suggesting a family link.

While people from afflicted lineages can reportedly prolong their lives by developing healthy habits such as a nutritious diet and regular exercise, researchers stated that, in the end, no matter how many precautions they take, their genetic susceptibility to dying will win out.

“We recommend alerting your doctor if there’s a history of death in your family, and if you aren’t certain, you should ask your parents if they know of any fatalities among your relatives,” Booth said. “This is also important information to know before deciding to have children yourself. Even if your own family is alive and well, it’s possible there is death somewhere in your partner’s ancestry.”

“If you have a grandparent or even a great-grandparent who has died, then sadly, the odds of your kids eventually dying are quite high,” she added.

When reached for comment, several of the study’s participants acknowledged they had at least one deceased family member, and expressed their fear and concern to reporters.

“I feel perfectly healthy now, but knowing that my father died definitely makes me worry that the same thing could happen to me one day,” said Randy Lewis, a 49-year-old who took part in the study. “But my mom is still alive, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I take after her side of the family.”

Added Lewis, “Unfortunately, I can only wait and see.”",Health/Science,Health,Onion,04-22-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/study-finds-those-with-deceased-family-members-at--38463,10-20-2015
1,Life-Saving Drug More Accessible To Lab Rat Than Majority Of Americans,"NEW YORK—Noting that the cost of the pharmaceutical drug places it out of reach for most of the U.S. populace, industry analysts confirmed Friday that the life-saving cancer medication Rizolafan remains far more accessible to a laboratory rat than to the vast majority of Americans. “While this drug has shown considerable efficacy in counteracting tumor growth, U.S. citizens who are currently suffering from advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer are far less likely to obtain a desperately needed dose than any number of albino rodents locked in cages in a biotech firm’s animal lab,” said Mount Sinai chief of medicine Dr. Martin Aberg, who stated that the average rat infected with the terminal illness could expect to receive as much of the medication as needed, while the thousands of people suffering from the same disease who live in the wealthiest country in the world likely would not. “Whereas most cancer-stricken Americans face insurmountable barriers to receiving this drug, ranging from insufficient insurance coverage to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs, and despite the fact that such a treatment could ease their suffering and significantly extend their lives, it is nevertheless consistently and freely available to hundreds of rats, which do not have to contend with any such obstacles.” Analysts also confirmed that the average rodent was provided with more personalized and attentive care than nearly 98 percent of patients in American hospitals.",Health/Science,Health,Onion,09-25-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/life-saving-drug-more-accessible-lab-rat-majority--51385,10-20-2015

1,High levels of childhood obesity in Canada 'great for business' says high school bully,"Peterborough, ON -- Teenage tyrants across the country raised their victim's underpants in jubilation today after learning that childhood obesity rates in Canada continue to rise “faster than your mom’s cholesterol”, as expressed in a public statement released by bully lobbyist group “Fists Against Tubsters” (FAT).

This morning, Health Canada released a report claiming obesity in Canadian children has risen from 5% in the late 1970's, to 12% in 2014, to 13% this year. For bullies, the faster these numbers rise, the slower their victims get.

""Pilfered lunch money profits have already risen 17% since grade 9. We haven't seen growth this rapid since Charlie ‘Whale Whisperer’ Waldon left to visit family in Texas and came back bigger than the state itself,""  remarked twelfth grader Scut Farkus, a leading light in the bullying community at John Malcolm High in Peterborough and president of the FAT Kawartha chapter. ""Every year we're finding more and more of our clients move slower than my dead grandma on horse tranquilizers.""

Not only have profits increased, but marijuana sales are rising steadily as students find themselves able to spend less time beating down “lardos”, and more time hitting the bong.

""I’ve never had this much extra time on my hands. I’ve been smoking whole joints before homeroom all year, man. These days, most kids give up trying to run after a few wobbles,"" said grade eleven bully Biff Tannen, treasurer for the FAT. ""I mean the cost of obesity to North American nerds is enormous. About $10 per kid on a good day.""

1,"Female Viagra' lets women with sexual dysfunction add fainting, nausea, dizziness to symptoms","RALEIGH, NC - This past week flibanserin or “female Viagra” was approved by the FDA, allowing women nationwide to combat low sex-drive while only suffering from of a long list of incapacitating side effects.

""The effects have been amazing,"" said Milwaukee woman Sandra Thompson. ""With this new drug, my husband and I are intimate anywhere between one and one-and-a-half times more per month. Sure, I’m throwing up every three hours, but our love life is saved!""

Mark, Mrs. Thompson's husband, has also felt the changes brought on by the drug. ""Flibanserin is fantastic. Sandra can't keep her hands off of me 3.5% more on average, and you’re darn tootin’ if that’s almost statistically significant.""

The new drug has seen many positive reviews in its first week on the market, with women around the country writing in between fainting spells and the sometimes sex they’re having. “Sex used to be lifeless for me,” said San Francisco resident Elizabeth Wu. “ But with flibanserin I’ve found passion again. Sex is so much more interesting when the room is constantly spinning!""

Some critics have been unconvinced that the side effects are worth the drug’s “sexy, but literally only once in a blue moon,” effects. Manufacturer Sprout Pharmaceuticals has been quick to defend its aphrodisiac sedative.

 ""You have to understand that this is the first market drug of its kind,"" responded Executive Vice President Rich Franco. ""We did the absolute best we could in developing this drug. It is definitely not a failed anti-depressant that we've been trying to hock for eight years.""

In the past few years lobbyists for Sprout have attempted to make the drug's release an issue of gender-equality, despite the FDA's concerns being focused on side-effects and other risks.""Look, this isn't about selling a drug,"" said Franco. ""This is about gender. Forget side effects, let’s talk front effects. This drug gives women sex. This is a drug for women. That's why we made it pink! You know, for women!""

1,Child dying from measles just glad he isn't autistic,"TORONTO - Quarantined in his hospital room after contracting a fatal case of measles, little Timothy Bartlet told reporters how glad he was that his parents opted not to vaccinate for fear of giving him autism.

“Wow! It sure is hard to die painfully from a totally preventable disease, but I guess it’s better than having autism, a disease with which many have led rich, full lives,” said Timmy. “Although I know the medical consensus is that there is no connection between vaccines and autism, I’m sure my parents knew what they were doing.”

Continued Timmy: “I mean, Daddy knew I would get sick when I ate those five cookies. Clearly his medical knowledge is up to snuff.”

Bartlet, who says he used to enjoy Pokemon, soda, and being alive, tells everyone how great it is to be left totally defenseless against common childhood diseases from the 1940s. However, he’s quick to point out that his parents don’t deserve all the credit.

“It was my parents’ decision to not vaccinate me,” said Timmy, in between hacking coughs. “But they would never have done it without all the uninformed leaders in the community: dangerously uneducated homeopaths, and of course the constant, untrustworthy behaviour of Big Pharma that drives people away from effective medicine.”

“The real credit goes to you.”

Timmy went on to say that, since measles is highly contagious, his parents can soon take credit for the happy struggle of many of his classmates.

1,Ontario middle schooler can't believe he has so much orgy and Satanism homework,"TORONTO - After only one week of the new sex-ed curriculum, local 7th grader Jimmy Donaldson can't believe he has to spend the entire weekend doing group sex and devil-worship assignments.

""Aw nuts!"" said Donaldson, throwing his backpack filled with anal beads and goat blood in frustration. ""Ralph wasn't kidding when he said middle school was tough.""

The homework, as mandated by Premier Kathleen Wynne, promises to teach children about gender identity, the dangers of sexting, and avoiding abusive relationships. However, its main focus is on how to properly worship the Prince of Darkness and the best ways to host and participate in an orgy.

“How the heck am I supposed to know how many points a pentagram has?” complained Donaldson, looking over his demonic summoning assignment. “Wait… ‘penta’? Five! Just like how there are five hands in a penta-fisting!”

While many have lauded the Premier for improving on the out-of-date curriculum, the changes have come under fire from religious parents who feel their rights are not being respected.

“Our new curriculum is designed to prepare our children for real life in the twenty first century, by dredging them in sins of the flesh as the dark lord commands, robbing their innocence and soiling their souls for eternal damnation,"" said Premier Wynne while pulling on her nipple clamps. “That’s why we included those lessons on respecting homosexuals.

The pope should just stick to theology and let the several dozen scientists who support the scientifically disproven point of view on global warming do the talking.” Bush also told reporters that Pope Francis was unqualified to issue policy recommendations of any kind unless he had personally accepted money from the fossil fuel industry.

1,Climate Change Deniers Present Graphic Description Of What Earth Must Look Like For Them To Believe,"WASHINGTON—Evoking cataclysmic scenes of extreme weather and widespread drought and famine, the nation’s climate change deniers held a press conference Wednesday to describe exactly what the Earth must look like before they will begin to believe in human-induced global warming.

The group of skeptics, who said that the consensus among 97 percent of the scientific community and the documented environmental transformations already underway are simply not proof enough, laid out the precise sequence and magnitude of horrific events—including natural disasters, proliferation of infectious diseases, and resource wars—they would have to witness firsthand before they are swayed.

“For us to accept that the average surface temperature of the Earth has risen to critical levels due to mankind’s production of greenhouse gases, we’ll need to see some actual, visible evidence, including a global death toll of no less than 500 million people within a single calendar year,” said spokesperson William Davis, 46, of Jackson, NJ, who added that at least 70 percent of all islands on the planet would also have to become submerged under rising seas before he and his cohort would reconsider their beliefs. “To start, we’re going to have to see supercell tornadoes of category F4 or higher ripping through Oklahoma at least three times a day, leveling entire communities and causing hundreds of fatalities—and just to be perfectly clear, we’re talking year-round, not just during the spring tornado season.”

“I don’t think it’s too much to ask to see a super hurricane destroying the Southeast U.S. and another one at the same time decimating the Pacific Northwest before I make up my mind about this.”
“The reality is that we’re still experiencing cold, snowy winters, and the entire global population is not currently embarking on cross-continental migrations in search of arable land,” Davis continued. “Until that changes, we cannot be expected to believe climate change is occurring.”

Davis went on to say that certain events, such as massive, uncontrollable wildfires across the U.S—not just restricted to the American West, but in areas including Florida and New England—would render climate change deniers open to reevaluating the decades’ worth of data that show the planet is warming at a catastrophic rate. Additionally, Davis said that for the community to begin believing a single word of any scientific journal article corroborating climate change, every one of Earth’s glaciers would have to retreat at a rate exceeding 20 miles per year, and each of the skeptics, individually, would have to go a decade without seeing naturally occurring ice anywhere.

Furthermore, climate change deniers maintained that if the total number of plant and animal species on the planet remained higher than 200 in aggregate, they would not be dissuaded from their belief that Earth is simply experiencing one of its natural warming cycles that would eventually resolve itself on its own.

“I don’t think it’s too much to ask to see a super hurricane destroying the Southeast U.S. and another one at the same time decimating the Pacific Northwest before I make up my mind about this,” said global warming skeptic Michelle Wilkinson of Medina, MN, adding that she would be willing to recognize the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change if repeated and unpredictable storm surge flooding rendered every major East Coast city, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., wholly uninhabitable. “The fact of the matter is that if I walk outside at any time of day at any point in the year and it’s below 90 degrees, then there simply isn’t enough proof that we need to be cutting carbon emissions.”

After clarifying that the desertification of major population centers, and the global refugee crisis that would result, would be necessary but not sufficient evidence of climate change, the skeptics reportedly unveiled a vivid artist’s rendering of the vast expanse of parched, lifeless earth and dead trees that each of them must see through the windows of their homes before reversing their opposition to public schools teaching children about global warming.

“We keep hearing all this mumbo-jumbo about the sixth mass extinction we’re in the midst of,” said Mitch McConnell, a U.S. senator from Kentucky, at the conclusion of the press conference. “Well, if that’s the case, then tell me this: Why aren’t the streets littered with human bodies right now, with the ragged bands of the still-living siphoning the moisture from the corpses of the dead?”

1,Montreal to dump entire editorial staff of MTLBlog into the St Lawrence,"Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre made a dramatic announcement today outlining his controversial plan to dump the entire editorial staff of MTLBlog, along with thousands of its most inane listicles and egregious clickbait, into the St Lawrence river, the city’s main waterway.

At a press conference at city hall early this morning, a frustrated Coderre described the dump as a necessary evil. “We don’t have a lot of options here. Either we get rid of this garbage now, or it pools up in our parks, in our streets, or even in our houses. There’s only so much space left in our sewer system for  insufferable blog posts about poutine and unpaid interns.”

Certain members of the destructive primate species - also referred to as humans - are discussing ideas on controlling the spread of animal much less harmful to the environment than themselves.

""The infestation is out of control,"" said Forest Products Association President Larry Whipple, whose species is responsible for the extinction of the dodo, Eastern elk, Guam flying fox and several more. ""The pine beetle is not only hurting our forests, but our economy as well.""

Humans expressed concern that their species may not be able to exploit, burn and desecrate forests in time before the pine beetle eats through the trees they intend on using for constructing houses.

""Warmer winters mean more beetles,"" said entomologist Virginia Lee who already has already reproduced three offspring placing a further burden on the local food source. “It’s only a matter of time before the entire Boreal Forest is littered in them.”

At the end of the conference, humans were contemplating the release of Cane Toads, Asian Carp and lampreys all at once to see what happens.

1,Canada commits to eleventy percent drop in carbon emissions by year zero-one-infinity,"OTTAWA - In a dramatic announcement that will certainly have a huge impact on the economy and environment, Stephen Harper and his government have announced they will enforce policies designed to cut Canadian carbon emissions by over ten thousand Attoparsecs within the next billion decades. 

“While the idea of man-made climate change remains very much in dispute by myself and that one Australian guy, the government of Canada has decided to take firm action on the matter,” said the PM at a press conference. “I can assure every Canadian that, because of our actions, your children, your children’s children, and your children’s half-robot future children will continue to live on a healthyish planet.”

“Within 25 megacenturies, our pollution rates will be cut by over 1000 Sagans,” Harper added to thunderous applause. 

Sources inside the PMO say that some Conservative Party members wanted to commit only to a drop of 500 Hubble-Barns, but ultimately relented when faced with their leader’s commitment to the environment. 

At press time Harper had announced an increase in government funding of environmental research of over 500 Lira a month.

1,RCMP arrest radical eco-terrorists planting trees 50 km from pipeline,"PRINCE GEORGE - RCMP have arrested seven radicalized eco-terrorists in connection to a plot to plant trees near an oil sands pipeline.

The trees were said to pose as a barricade to future pipeline development.

“We apprehended the suspects just as they were carrying out their plot,” announced RCMP Sgt Rick Hughes. “However, these vicious, compost-loving fanatics were under surveillance for more than five years. They read extremists literature such as Silent Spring, participated in loud and frightening protests and listened to the fiery eco-mullah, David Suzuki. They often distributed recycling propaganda and posed a significant threat to the automobile economy by not driving a car.”

According to sources, the RCMP placed a mole inside their Vancouver-based ‘Friends of the Earth’ community group who spent two years gaining the group’s trust by being a strong advocate of animal rights and eating tofu.

""When it came time for the group to acquire the terror seedlings, the undercover officer replaced the 300 aspen, pine and spruce saplings with fake ones,"" added Hughes.

The announcement comes on the same week that U.S President Barack Obama renamed Mount McKinley to Mount Denali during his trip to Alaska.

“The most important thing I have learned during my time in office is to deny everything,” declared Harper. “This name change recognizes the Conservative Party’s contribution to what Canada is now all about; refusing budge on questions, investigations and humanitarian pleas.”

1,GOP Candidates Fiercely Divided Over How Much Voltage Border Wall Should Be Electrified With,"WASHINGTON—With various proposals emerging as key components of each of the 2016 presidential hopefuls’ immigration policies, sources confirmed Thursday that the Republican field remains sharply divided regarding how much voltage should be used to electrify a border wall with Mexico. “This continues to be one of the most contentious issues within the GOP ranks, with more moderate voices like Jeb Bush advocating for the fence to deliver a mild shock of 75 volts, while others, such as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, contend that no less than 20,000 volts coursing through the entire length of the 1,900-mile fence is needed to protect American interests,” said political analyst Bryant Suthers, adding that even candidates who typically share common ground, such as Mike Huckabee and Bobby Jindal, differ dramatically on how far backward they believe the fence’s electrical charge should blow would-be illegal immigrants when the wires are contacted. “And this is to say nothing of Ben Carson’s flip-flopping on whether to use a standard alternating current or a potentially more dangerous direct current, or the constant squabbling over how loudly the electrified wall should crackle and buzz to serve as a deterrent to any potential migrants and their children. It will be interesting to see which candidate’s views emerge victorious, as this is an issue that the party’s base is eager to see come to fruition.” Suthers noted, however, that none of the candidates had yet put forward any details about how they would fund the construction of the electrified wall or the specially trained border patrol units needed to scrape the charred remains of Mexicans off its surface.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Onion,09-24-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/gop-candidates-fiercely-divided-over-how-much-volt-51377,11-15-2015
1,Palestinian Man Marvels At How Much Childhood Refugee Camp Has Changed,"AL-SHATI, GAZA STRIP—Saying he hardly recognized some of the makeshift buildings and piles of rubble he played in as a child, Gaza native Ramzy Abu-Dhubah told reporters Tuesday he was struck by how much the refugee camp he grew up in has changed over the years.

As he walked through his “old stomping grounds” in Al-Shati, a 0.3-square-mile camp currently home to 87,000 displaced Palestinians, the 36-year-old remarked how the whole area seemed more bustling and crowded to him now than it did when he was a boy.

“So many of the spots where I used to hang out are gone, and they’ve all been replaced by new homes—I guess this place has really been growing,” Abu-Dhubah said as he pointed out a demolished concrete structure filled with improvised mud-brick shelters that had not been there when he left Gaza in 1999. “This used to be an empty lot where I’d play soccer, but there’s got to be a few dozen families that have moved in here now. They put in one of those big ration-distribution centers, too. My buddy Ibrahim was telling me that’s where pretty much everyone goes to eat these days.”

“It’s so surreal to think about these young kids today still being crammed into the same little rooms, doing all the things my classmates and I did way back when.”

“Oh, man, it looks like they even knocked down the old U.N. health clinic I used to go to as a kid,” he continued. “That’s really too bad.”

Reminiscing about the camp where he spent the first 21 years of his life, Abu-Dhubah observed that, while many of the cramped, narrow alleyways and contaminated water wells were just as he remembered them, there were a lot more Red Cross and Red Crescent triage stations than he recalled. At one point, he acknowledged getting lost amid the wreckage-strewn streets, saying he couldn’t get over how many people had put up new tents in the past few years.

“My old school is still here, but I almost didn’t recognize it with the north wall completely caved in like that,” Abu-Dhubah said. “It’s so surreal to think about these young kids today still being crammed into the same little rooms, doing all the things my classmates and I did way back when: sitting in the dark through power outages, playing in the open sewer at recess, dodging artillery shells and mortar blasts, burning trash.”

He added, “I guess some things never do change, you know?”

Abu-Dhubah paused a moment before he continued, admitting that the flood of memories from his youth had made him a bit emotional. Later, he showed reporters the 144-square-foot concrete room where he grew up, noting that his once quiet and unassuming side street was now cluttered with new residents and shrapnel.

“I’ve seen a lot of familiar faces since I’ve been back—it’s amazing how many of the same families are still around after all these years,” Abu-Dhubah said. “My friends always used to talk about how they’d get out of here, but most of them never did. Sure, Bashir’s in an Israeli prison these days, and I heard Ahmad and his kids have been gone since that IDF attack in 2014, but pretty much all the rest are still in the camp, and they’ve got families of their own now.”

“My grandma has been here, what, 67 years now?” he continued. “She’s not going anywhere.”Abu-Dhubah says the main street of his childhood refugee camp “looks completely different now” with all its new missile craters.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Onion,07-14-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/palestinian-man-marvels-how-much-childhood-refugee-50837,11-15-2015

Sadly, the trauma was so severe that he may never make a full recovery.” At press time, Walker had reportedly been severed in half at the torso while attempting to simultaneously hold two completely divergent positions on economic inequality.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Onion,08-24-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/out-control-scott-walker-injured-after-wildly-care-51167,11-15-2015

Right now we’re seeing exactly what she must’ve seen when she came through here 20 years ago.” Bertrand told reporters that while he found the experience moving, he would likely never be able to truly understand how his grandfather felt when he was informed that the gift shop was closed.",Politics/Civics,Immigration,Onion,05-08-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/child-visiting-ellis-island-sees-where-grandparent-50372,11-15-2015
1,Refugees Grateful For Chance To See Europe While Being Bounced From Country To Country,"BUDAPEST, HUNGARY—Saying they never dreamed they’d have the opportunity to do so much traveling and sightseeing, tens of thousands of refugees across Europe confirmed Tuesday that they were grateful for the chance to take in so many of the continent’s natural and historical treasures while being bounced from country to country. “I thought the Serbian countryside was so beautiful when we were marching through it, but, wow, Budapest is truly breathtaking—it’s a real architectural gem—and hopefully once our papers expire in 48 hours we’ll be off to somewhere new!” said Syrian refugee Majd Ahsan, who added that his European trip got off to a great start on the island of Lesbos in Greece, where he said he was really able to soak in the Mediterranean landscape by spending his every waking and sleeping moment outdoors. “We actually got to spend a couple extra days in Athens while the Macedonian borders were closed, which was a real treat—there’s just so much rich history right there! At this point, who knows which country we’ll see tomorrow or the next day. Germany? France? Ooh, maybe we’ll go to Prague, get turned away at a processing center, and be sent to Poland!

1,Temporary foreign robots to replace domestic robots that replaced human workers,"OTTAWA -- Several Canadian manufacturing companies announced that the domestic robots that replaced thousands of Canadian workers will be replaced by temporary foreign robots.

Canada’s new and controversial Temporary Foreign Robot program will allow Canadian companies to hire robots manufactured in other countries - mostly Japan and China - to work at a lower upkeep cost and longer hours for a predetermined amount of time before returning to their home country. 

“It’s so expensive to employ a Canadian programmable machine,” explained CEO Victor Jamesh of Dynamic Synergy Industries, an automotive manufacturer that recently announced the layoffs of all of its domestic robots. “They only work 18 hours a day, require more maintenance and is much less productive. Now I have 50 temporary foreign machines that can do the same work as 200 Canadian machines.”

But many out-of-work manufacturer workers were not happy to hear that the robots that replaced them were now going to be replaced by robots from a foreign country.

“At least I could sleep at night knowing that a Canadian manufactured robot took my job,” explained Michael Gerivatso, an unemployed tool and die maker. “But now our country is overrun by these robotic immigrants. 

“The government needs to end this program immediately and give these patriot robots their jobs back!”

1,Aboriginal tribe using new immigration law to deport all white people,"OTTAWA - Following the passage of bill C-24, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act, which gives the government powers to revoke citizenship and deport recent immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, an Ojibwa First Nation tribe has filed a lawsuit under the act to deport all white people from Canada. 

“As the government has said, citizenship in Canada is a privilege and not a right,” said tribe leader Harold Foxwood. “We have determined it is in the best interests of the safety of all true Canadians for you to go back where you came from.”

Foxwood subsequently clarified the tribe’s legal position. “The Act clearly states that recent immigrants who commit crimes against the state can be deported. By my people's standards the few hundred years white Europeans have been here is very recent. As for the committing crimes part, really? You know what you white guys did.”

Justice department spokesperson Ian Kinsler said the government originally intended to fight the lawsuit, but had to admit the tribe had a winning argument. 

“We kind of got hoisted on our own petard here. Not going to lie, we were originally going to use this act to deport muslims for minor crimes and sketchy connections to accused terrorist sympathizers. But they got us good with this one. Oh well. I think I still have an aunt in Frankfurt.”

When asked why his tribe was not also moving for the deportation of more recent immigrants like Asian-Canadians and African-Canadians, Foxwood stated “meh.

1,Meet the 23 year-old PMO staffer who denied all of the Syrian refugees into Canada,"OTTAWA -- In a small office located within the bowels of Stephen Harper’s PMO sits a young man responsible for halting all Syrian refugee applications.

When he’s not busy wiretapping Justin Trudeau’s personal cell phone, 23 year-old PMO staffer Matthew McIsaac has spent the past five months denying thousands of refugees any hope of entering Canada.

“We told the bureaucrats that there was no ‘Immigration’ in ‘Citizenship and Immigration’, but they weren’t getting the message,’ explained the recent graduate of the University of Calgary political science program. “So the PM told me to intervene about the problem based on a ‘security risk.’”

McIssac laughed heartily at the inane rationale.

“And it was really that easy!” chuckled the young man wearing an Armani suit. “I told the spineless bureaucrats that there were members of the Islamic State among these refugees and not a single application was processed for months. I put another 10,000 into the shredder.”

1,Dean Del Mastro to be stripped of citizenship as soon as a country agrees to take him in,"OTTAWA — The prime minister’s office announced on Thursday that former Conservative MP and Harper spokesman Dean Del Mastro, who had just been sentenced to a month in jail for violating the Canada Elections Act, would be stripped of his citizenship the moment another country agreed to take him off Canada’s hands.

“Bill C-24 has made it possible for us to crack down on partially Canadian criminals,” Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander explained. “Mr. Del Mastro’s wrongdoings have so little to do with this government that we doubt he’s even Canadian.”

Asked where Del Mastro might go, Alexander appeared unconcerned.

“We’ve hired fixers and planes to deport refugee claimants to Africa before, so how different would it be to give a former party bigwig one last flight on a private jet?” Alexander asked.

“Look at all the countries that took in Guantanamo detainees before we repatriated Omar Khadr,” he said. “So long as Del Mastro isn’t Canadian, he should have no trouble finding a new home.”

1,Chris Alexander goes back in time to deny ancestors entry into Canada,"NEWARK, UPPER CANADA -- Citing his strong personal conviction that refugees must complete proper screening before entering Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander has traveled back to the 1780s to deny his ancestors’ refugee claim.

Alexander, acting as a colonial administrator for British North America, intercepted seven of his ascendants trying to cross the Niagara River who were fleeing the American Revolution.

“We are betwixt two frontiers and not ample supplies to last us a fortnight,” explained Herbert John Alexander, a farmer who was fleeing Pennsylvania because of his loyalty to King George III. “I hath already been tarred and feathered as a traitor. I face a certain death by hanging if I return.”

“That’s unfortunate, but there is no evidence of who you are, nor any paperwork,” Minister Alexander responded with a list and feather pen in hand. “You don’t even have any titles to this land and there are many other refugees who have been waiting for years to enter. Additionally, there aren’t five signatures from His Majesty's Subjects that can vouch for you as refugees.”

Alexander also pointed out to his ascendants that two of the five children have scurvy, which would place a burden on Upper Canada’s fledgling farming economy.

“We can’t have these boys being reliant on charity instead of doing farm chores,” Alexander scolded. 

The Minister even went as far as to suggest his Loyalist great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather could potentially be a security threat.

“There are Yankees hiding among these refugees who want to turn British North America into a Republic! You might have been corrupted by the dangerous ideal of not being taxed without proper representation. Your loyalty may not lie with the His Majesty’s Government, but with the enemy.”

I don’t care what you have to do, just so long as we can hit our numbers and make way for the anti-aircraft shipments we’ve got coming in at the end of the month.” Members of Donaldson’s team said they weren’t particularly worried about the directive, noting that they can always reach out to their congressional contacts and move however many missiles they need to via a last-minute rider on any pending bill.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Onion,09-03-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/lockheed-martin-sales-staff-instructed-really-push-51236,11-16-2015
1,Executive Recalls Booming Private Prison Corporation’s Humble Beginnings As Modest 6-Cell Facility,"PHOENIX—Speaking to reporters Tuesday from his spacious corner office in the company’s sleek downtown corporate headquarters, Harbor Corrections Group CEO Walter G. Parks reminisced fondly about the business’s humble beginnings as a modest six-cell prison.

Parks recalled how he founded HCG in 1986, back when “[he] was just a kid,” in his words, with a single government contract and only a handful of convicts to his company’s name, pausing often to share colorful asides about his business’s early struggles. The executive then marveled at how his small, independent operation had since grown into a $3 billion detention-services firm with offerings that expand beyond criminal incarceration to encompass the confinement of juvenile offenders, the mentally ill, and migrants awaiting deportation.

“I’d say we’ve come a long way since those crazy early days,” said Parks, chuckling at the thought of the multiple loans he took out to finance the initial 1,300-square-foot facility and the long hours he put in trying to get the company’s name out to various states’ departments of corrections. “When we opened for business, all we had was two or three part-time guards for the whole place—that’s it. We didn’t even have a watchtower at first, just a guy on the roof who sat in a folding chair with a rifle on his lap. Hard to believe, but that’s how we got our start.”

“If you’d told me back then—back when we had only one basketball hoop in the yard and barely enough money to keep the surveillance cameras on—that one day we’d have 80,000 beds at 60 facilities in 22 states, I’d have called you nuts,” he continued.

According to Parks, it was “all hands on deck” the first few years, and for a time, he handled the intake of each prisoner personally, filling out all the necessary forms and overseeing the filing system, and even stepping in on occasion to act as the facility’s cook to provide the inmates with their three square meals a day. In those days, he said, the cell HCG used for solitary confinement doubled as its office supply closet. Now, his employees work in more roomy environs, with the company’s 40-person in-house lobbying division occupying an entire floor of a modern office complex.

Parks confirmed that for much of its first decade in business, the company might go weeks, or even months, without securing a no-bid contract to ship in prisoners from out of state. But in 1995, after a handful of well-placed campaign contributions and a concerted effort to help pass tough “three strikes” sentencing laws in state legislatures, HCG was reportedly able to break ground on its first of many full-size maximum-security prisons.

“There were times early on when I’d walk down the hall, pass only three or four inmates, and think, ‘How are we going to make it to the end of the month?’” said Parks, recalling several periods in which the company “hemorrhaged money” due to low recidivism, the result of occasional public investment in criminal rehabilitation programs. “Compare that to now, though, when all of our prisons are filled to the gills and we’re housing the overflow on bunks in the gymnasiums.”

“And what’s more, we’re hiring them all out as manual labor at pennies on the dollar,” he added. “Talk about a success story.”

Parks confided that in the days before mandatory minimum sentences became widespread, the only thing that kept HCG in business was the occasional prison riot, which resulted in more time being added to inmates’ sentences, helping to ensure more of the company’s cells stayed occupied and bolstering its revenue.

Nowadays, he explained, his business is so successful that it can pick and choose whom it imprisons, turning away difficult criminals who are more costly to house.

“Sure, it was touch and go for a while,” said Parks, admitting he used to second-guess whether it would ever be possible “to break even at this game.” “But that just makes it all the sweeter now that we’ve come out the other side and can now call ourselves an industry leader.”

“At this rate, we’re going to have 40 additional facilities in the United States by 2025,” he added. “And we’ve got plans for more on the way.”",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Onion,11-03-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/executive-recalls-booming-private-prison-corporati-51781,11-16-2015
1,Bisquick Unveils Sprawling State-Of-The-Art Silicon Valley Campus,"SUNNYVALE, CA—Explaining how every feature of the sleek, modern work environment was expressly constructed to foster creativity and innovation, executives from Bisquick unveiled the company’s immense new Silicon Valley campus Friday.

The 650,000-square-foot Gehry Partners–designed complex, built to accommodate the baking-mix maker’s growing staff and expansive research division, reportedly includes a soaring seven-story glass atrium, dozens of diversely themed and luxuriously appointed meeting rooms, a state-of-the-art batter lab, and a landscaped 8.5-acre rooftop green space and recreation area.

“Bisquick is always looking toward the future, and every aspect of our new headquarters reflects our commitment to supporting the best minds in the home-baking industry,” said Bisquick VP of employee engagement Melissa Reinert, adding that the prime Bay Area location and dozens of onsite amenities were intended to attract the very best talent from around the world. “Our goal is to remove any barriers to productivity and give employees every resource—from custom nonstick griddles to personal nap pods—that they could possibly need to succeed.”

“We want our employees to be dreaming big,” Reinert continued. “After all, the pancake and biscuit recipes being devised on this campus are the ones everyone will be mixing 10 years from now.”

According to company sources, the campus’s main building, a distinctive angular structure of gleaming steel and glass nicknamed “The Playground,” features a sprawling open-plan layout meant to facilitate employee interaction. To move between departments—as far as a mile between IT and Weeknight Meal Ideas—the company has reportedly provided several hundred rechargeable electric scooters, while a fleet of Wi-Fi-equipped Bisquick vans is said to be available 24 hours a day to shuttle workers between the complex and their homes in San Francisco, Berkeley, San Jose, and other surrounding cities.

“It’s well known that Bisquick expects a lot from its employees, but in return we’ve strived to give them the benefits to match.” 
Reinert said the values Bisquick sought to embody in the design of the campus are the same that drive the company itself: simplicity, freshness, quality, and fun. To that end, Bisquick added many communal facilities, including a full-size saltwater swimming pool, 10 onsite pancake bars stocked with organic fruits and various flavors of syrup, a Japanese zen garden hand-constructed in Kyoto and reassembled on campus, and a weekly lecture series at the grounds’ 2,000-seat amphitheater featuring speakers such as futurist Michio Kaku, fiction writer Stephenie Meyer, and former British prime minister Tony Blair.

Additionally, located in a black cube-shaped building in the northwest corner of the campus is Futurequick, Bisquick’s secretive advanced R&D group accessible only to a select few employees with the highest security clearance, which is purportedly responsible for trailblazing technological feats like the company’s premade Shake ’N Pour pancakes and the ice cream wafflewich.

“It’s well known that Bisquick expects a lot from its employees, but in return we’ve strived to give them the benefits to match,” said Reinert, highlighting the company’s free onsite daycare and hot yoga classes. “Our workers are unquestionably the best, and this environment is meant to empower them to build their own agendas. In fact, we encourage every hire to set aside 20 percent of their time for quick-bake passion projects.”

“Our Bisquick Bakery Refrigerated Dough product was actually dreamed up by an employee in Finance during his Free-Focus Time,” she added. “That’s a perfect example of the kind of brilliant minds we have here at Bisquick.”

While many in the area have hailed the arrival of Bisquick, some longtime residents—wary of higher rents and the company’s famously insular corporate culture—have expressed skepticism.

“Bisquick is just another one of these Silicon Valley behemoths that moves in and totally changes the community—and not for the better,” said local resident Peter Watson, who noted that the land used for Bisquick’s indoor rock climbing wall used to be open park space that the city sold to help attract the company. “When I moved here in the ’80s, it was all students and families; now, my whole street is nothing but Bisquick millionaires in their electric cars and luxury penthouses.”

“My neighbors and I have complained to the city council, but with Bisquick’s deep pockets, there really isn’t anything we can do,” Watson added. “I guess we just have to put up with it and hope that, sooner or later, this pancake bubble bursts.”",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Onion,10-23-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/bisquick-unveils-sprawling-state-art-silicon-valle-51713,11-16-2015
1,Goodwill Executives Arrested After Years Of Skimming Donated Goods Off Top,"ROCKVILLE, MD—In what authorities are calling one of the most wide-reaching and deplorable cases of embezzlement in recent history, seven executives at Goodwill Industries International were arrested Thursday for allegedly skimming used clothing, old furniture, small appliances, and thousands of other donated items from the charitable group.

“We’re looking at some very serious abuses at the highest levels of Goodwill’s corporate hierarchy,” said FBI lead investigator Samuel Corson, addressing reporters as he stood next to a table piled high with dozens of CRT computer monitors and Rainbow Brite lunchboxes confiscated in recent federal raids. “Velcro orthopedic shoes, mini trampolines, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass LPs—these individuals were defrauding their own organization of thousands upon thousands of previously owned and slightly damaged items.”


Some of the evidence recovered from the Goodwill executives’ residences.


“From the number of Sunbeam-brand blenders and porcelain cherubs we’ve seized so far, we estimate this misappropriation of goods has been going on for more than a decade,” he added.

Corson said the FBI was first alerted to the situation early last year, when an anonymous whistleblower inside the nonprofit organization tipped off agents to an ongoing scheme in which garbage bags full of elastic-waisted jeans and old Cub Scout uniforms would be accepted from legitimate donors and then immediately diverted to an undisclosed private warehouse, never making it to the shelves at Goodwill’s retail locations.

Authorities confirmed that in order to build their case against the group’s leadership, they monitored suspects around the clock, often taking thousands of surveillance photos of high-ranking employees as they left Goodwill locations with armloads of souvenir ashtrays and novelty shot glasses. Many executives were also reportedly spotted in public using promotional umbrellas from auto insurance companies or bowling balls engraved with other people’s names.

“These guys cooked the books so no one would know they had their hand in the donation bin,” said Christopher Chen, a forensic accountant with the FBI. “For example, if someone left 10 VHS tapes in the drop-off box, they would only mark nine of those as received. Suddenly, you have a Jane Fonda workout video that doesn’t exist on paper, and one of these crooked Goodwill execs is taking it home. They skimmed 10 percent off the top like that all the time.”

“It began with a used wheelchair here and a Danielle Steel paperback there, but pretty soon they started to think they were untouchable,” he continued. “A box of old pocket calculators would ‘fall off a truck,’ and they couldn’t stop themselves. They kept wanting more.”

After executing search warrants in the suspects’ homes and rented storage units, law enforcement agents said they carted away a sizable number of AM/FM radios and golf visors advertising Pepsi products, as well as hundreds of malfunctioning Big Mouth Billy Bass toys.

Legal experts have estimated that, if convicted, the executives could be forced to pay up to $450 in restitutions.

“I got suspicious when I noticed some costume jewelry missing from the store and that very same night saw [Goodwill CFO] Dennis Shepler’s wife at a restaurant flaunting a pair of familiar-looking clip-on earrings and a Hard Rock Café denim jacket,” said a cashier at a Bethesda, MD Goodwill location, who wished not to be identified. “Then our store manager who’s been to their house told me their kitchen has more drip coffeemakers with missing carafes than she’s ever seen in her life. Something about that just didn’t add up.”

Defense attorney Gary McMullin, who represents several of the accused executives, proclaimed their innocence as he spoke to reporters in his office, inviting them to sit down in a variety of worn, mismatched chairs.

“Goodwill is a compassionate organization that provides so much to those in need, and my clients have given years of dedicated, selfless service to this company,” McMullin said as he stood near a bookcase containing five nonconsecutive volumes of the World Book Encyclopedia and adjusted the “Home of the Whopper” belt buckle holding up his flared, stained tuxedo pants. “These allegations are completely outrageous, and we absolutely intend to fight them.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Onion,10-04-2016,http://www.theonion.com/article/goodwill-executives-arrested-after-years-skimming--51247,11-16-2015

1,Starbucks marks Remembrance Day by remembering Christmas is seven weeks away,"CLARINGTON, ON -- Starbucks locations from across Canada are marking November 11th by festively reminding customers that the Holidays are only a mere seven weeks away.

“We are honouring our vets this week by reminding them to get into the Holiday cheer for the next two months,” said a chipper barista while making a skinny tall peppermint mocha, “This is just something we couldn’t wait until November 12th!”

“Oh, and the cups are red like the poppies; what a great, festive coincidence!” added the barista who was now making a double ristretto, venti, half-soy, nonfat, decaf, organic, Gingerbread Frappuccino, extra hot with foam, whipped cream, upside down double blended, one Sweet'N Low, and one nutrasweet, and ice.

The international coffee conglomerate was sure that the incessant playing of Peggy Lee’s ‘Winter Wonderland’ in their coffee shops would bring back many fond memories for veterans who sacrificed their own Christmases while serving overseas.

“The 11th is a very sacred 44 days away from the most important one,” said Starbucks Canada Chief Holiday Marketing Officer Patrice Nash. “However, we must pay our respect to the new, delicious, Holiday drinks available. 

“Lest we forget the Toffee Nut Latte!”

1,Bombardier develops new jet capable of breaking government bailout barrier,"MIRABEL -- In an effort the revolutionize the Canadian aerospace industry, Bombardier Inc. has been tirelessly working to break the taxpayer investment barrier with a newer version of the CSeries jet.

While the new aircraft’s development has experienced many delays and cost overruns, it is expected to obtain billions in government money breaking previous records.

“This new model will permit us to receive outlandish amounts of cash even though we won’t produce one for years,” explained Bombardier CEO Pierre Beaudoin. “When we break that money barrier, we will hear an angry boom in public opinion. That’s what I call innovation!”

Beaudoin believes that his educated and experienced team of lobbyists and union members can keep pushing the envelope of taxpayer subsidized industries.

“We’re hoping for $10 billion by the end of 2016 when persuade the provincial and federal government that layoffs are impeding because of the tough aeronautical market. We know the sky's the limit...except when it comes to producing and delivering better aircraft on time and on budget. We can’t do that.”

At press time, aeronautical engineers were busy testing the new model aircraft by firing $1,000 bills into the wind tunnel.

1,Wynne promises sale of Hydro One won’t cause problems until she’s out of office,"TORONTO - Coming on the heels of criticism of her government’s proposed sale of 60 percent of Hydro One, Premier Wynne has reassured the province it is a move that will only cause trouble ‘after I am no longer premier.’

“Will a private Hydro One be less willing to put public policy ahead of profits? Yes,” said Wynne. “But by then I’ll have left office as the person who paid for transit infrastructure without raising taxes, so it all evens out.”

Although some have criticised the plan for removing Hydro One from public audits and oversight, Wynne shot back by saying it would take ‘at least a few years’ for corruption or incompetence to mess things up, by which time she would already be ‘making bank on the speaking-tour circuit.’

“People are complaining that the sale will result in a lot of long-term lost revenue for the province,” said Wynne. “In the long run, maybe that's bad for healthcare and pensions, but hey, even with all the jogging, I’ve only got to ride out the next three decades, tops.”

Critics have slammed Wynne for rushing the plan through the legislature without proper debate, but supporters have fired back, saying that the degradation of proper parliamentary procedure wouldn’t develop into a problem until the PC’s or NDP were in power.

“Sure, I don’t like it when Conservatives cash in public resources for one-time money instead of raising revenue,” said Liberal supporter Callum MacPherson. “But this is a Liberal government, so it has to be a progressive move.”

1,Beer Store offers craft brewers opportunity to buy their children back,"TORONTO - In the wake of lawsuits threatening their monopoly on beer sales in Ontario, The Beer Store is extending an olive branch to craft brewers, by offering them the chance to buy their stolen children back.

“We’ve been hearing from small brewers for a while,” said Beer Store spokesperson Jeff Newton. “What they’ve been saying is, ‘we want more representation at the Beer Store, we want more competition, give us back our children.’ We’re willing to work on that last one.”

The new agreement would allow craft brewers producing less than 5 million litres a year to purchase their kidnapped children back for only $100 a head, while larger craft breweries would have to pay $1000 for each child they wanted to rescue from the Beer Store’s prison coolers.

Certain small brewers have hailed the agreement as a ‘step in the right direction’.

“In an ideal world, the Beer Store would never have broken into my house in the middle of the night and abducted my children at gunpoint,” said Paul Meek, of Kichesippi Beer Co. “But I’m willing to let it go, just for the chance to see my Claire and Danny again.”

Others remain skeptical.

“We have a lot of questions,” said Cam Heaps, chairman of the Ontario Craft Brewers. “This announcement certainly does not address our major issue of finding out whether or not our children are even still alive.”

Although Premier Wynne has suggested an interest in dismantling the Beer Store in the past, she could not be reached for comment, because of a diplomatic tour of the Labatt Sex Zeppelin.

Originally set up as a consortium of Ontario breweries in 1927, the Beer Store is currently owned by the American company Molson-Coors, the Belgian AB InBev, the Japanese Sapporo, and the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel.

At press time, a new offer from the Beer Store allowed craft brewers to bring in their children’s empty clothes for a five or ten-cent refund.",Business/Technology,Business Announcements,Beaverton,01-28-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/business/item/1724-beer-store-offers-craft-brewers-opportunity-to-buy-their-children-back,11-16-2015
1,Tim Hortons layoffs coincide with launch of new DoubleMeat Breakfast Sandwich,"OAKVILLE, ON - Just hours after their parent company Burger King announced layoffs at Tim Hortons HQ, the coffee chain has announced a new, even meatier breakfast sandwich.

“DoubleMeat means just that,” said Tim Hortons representative Chandra Dekeresedy. “Twice the meat. Don’t ask us how we got all the extra meat, all that’s important is, we’re passing the meat-savings on to you, the customer.”

“You might say, we’ve been trimming the fat,” added Dekeresey.

“A ha ha ha ha ha, A ha ha ha ha ha.”

Critics of the company initially derided the DoubleMeat as yet another lackluster product calculated to make Tim Hortons viable outside of Canada, like the panini sandwich, pretzel bagel, or bacon ice-capp.

“It turns out, though, that the DoubleMeat is pretty good,” said food critic Rachelle Dubrovski. “Actually, it’s really good. I want another one. I need another one. I lust for the taste of the meat within.”

Company profits have exploded as the layoffs have increased, with customers wolfing down sandwich after glistening sandwich in their local Timmy’s, each one tantalised by the mystery of what meat is contained within.

“It tastes like pork, only better,” said local customer Jeremy Grote, while the restaurant Team Members looked on with sickened dismay or cold indifference. “The flavour reminds me of the barbecues I had with my Dad, growing up. He works for Tim Hortons, and we always used to get free coffees for our road trips up to the lake. I wonder why he hasn’t been answering his phone today. Hey, why am I crying?”

Despite the record new profits, Burger King has given no answer as to whether they will rehire the laid off employees.

“Obviously, we hate to have to give so many people the metaphorical axe,” said a grinning Burger King exec whose entire shirt was drenched in ketchup. “But on the other hand, would you like to try one of these sandwiches? They’re quite fresh, quite fresh.”

This is not the first time that Burger King has been a locus of human misery.

And while we still have a few minor issues to iron out when people eat peanut butter, this is nevertheless a major step forward.” Roush added that the company is already at work on an updated version that will be capable of interpreting the inarticulate moans and grunts made by users after they have eaten too much.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Onion,03-19-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/new-speech-recognition-software-factors-in-users-m-38257,11-18-2015
1,Nation Figured Everything Would Run On Some Kind Of Cubes Of Blue Energy By Now,"NEW YORK—Expressing their disappointment and frustration at the current state of technology, citizens across the nation reported Thursday that they figured everything would run on some sort of cubes of blue energy by now.

Americans of all ages and demographic groups explained to reporters that they thought the cubes would be “basically everywhere you looked at this point,” saying they could not understand why translucent, pulsating blue cubes of energy did not yet exist, and why they were not currently being used to power appliances, lighting, various modes of transportation, and all manner of personal electronics.

Many theorized that the blue cubes of energy would last between 50 years and forever, and that those in need of more cubes would simply be able to pick them up at a local “cube station.”
“All you’d have to do is pick up the cube and put it on a thing you want to have power, and that would give it power—why can’t I do that yet?” said Lawrence Faber of Tampa, FL, one of millions of Americans who was confused that he was currently unable to fully charge his iPhone battery “in, like, 10 seconds” simply by holding the device in the vicinity of a blue cube of energy. “They’d be these cubes and they’d just be there and make everything work, like computers and TVs and stuff.”

“You know, like blue energy cubes,” Faber added. “We should have those.”

Although the majority of people surveyed were unable to verbally describe the cubes beyond “blue” and “glowing,” many pantomimed box-like shapes with their hands to demonstrate their best guess as to the general appearance of the blue cubes of energy, often adding, “like this.”

“I figured there would be a real big cube that would sit in the middle of town that powered all the streetlights and things like that, and then a smaller cube in your house for your refrigerator and your heaters and everything else,” said Youngstown, OH resident Kendra Morgan. “And then you’d have some littler cubes that you could carry around with you in your pocket for whatever else you needed them for, like a blow dryer or a coffee machine, and the cubes would make all of them run.”

Many theorized that the blue cubes of energy would last between 50 years and forever, and that those in need of more cubes would simply be able to pick them up at a local “cube station.” Others speculated that the cubes would be far more powerful than today’s energy sources, including oil, coal, and natural gas, because “they would have so much energy inside of them.”

Most Americans agreed, however, that the cubes would be affordable, noting that every citizen would have “a bunch.”

“You wouldn’t have to plug them in—they would just sit there and make power,” said Stephen Garcia of Mesa, AZ, later adding that everyone would be able to make their car run by simply placing the cube in the automobile’s “cube holder.” “But they would be really quiet, too. And when you carried them around, they wouldn’t zap you or be too hot to hold or anything, even though all the energy would be whirling around inside.”

“The cubes wouldn’t hurt people; they would help people,” Garcia continued.

Additionally, many Americans surveyed said that the blue cubes of energy would be incredibly durable and would never break, even if they were dropped on the ground or a drink was accidentally spilled on them.

But by far the biggest recurrent complaint reportedly stemming from the lack of blue cubes of energy was that further technological advances—namely “even faster” blue cubes of energy—were being held back due to the cubes not yet having been invented.

“How are we all supposed to live in space if we don’t have the blue cubes of energy?” said David Reston of Batavia, NY, later adding that NASA would probably develop its own special “super” blue energy cubes. “We need those cubes for our spaceship boosters to get us around in space. And how are we going to live in our houses up on Mars without those cubes?”

“At this rate, we’ll never have the red, floating spheres that make you live forever,” Reston added.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Onion,11-12-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/nation-figured-everything-would-run-some-kind-cube-51834,11-18-2015

The creepiest part is that it even seems to know my shoe size.

“Until today, simulating the experience of watching online porn has simply been the stuff of fantasy,” said Brazzers executive Janet Ingersson. “But now, using 180 degree stereoscopic 3D technology, our product is able to give users the sensation that they are sitting in front of a real-life computer watching an actual pornographic film.”

Despite the mostly glowing reviews, some consumers have expressed annoyance with the headset’s buffering feature, which simulates the experience of having to wait while a frozen video takes several minutes to finish loading.

1,New generation of e-cigarettes will provide authentic cancer experience,"CANADA - In a recent breakthrough by electronic cigarette manufacturers the next generation of e-cigarettes on the market will cause cancer and other complications, giving what distributors are calling a more authentic experience.

""This is monumental,"" said Pat Johnson, owner of popular distributor CanCigs. ""For years our consumers have been prevented from getting the genuine cigarette experience, limited by the technology available. This development is a complete game changer.""

E-cigarettes became popular in the early 2000's as a smoking substitute designed to curb cigarette addictions. Since then, scientists have been working on making e-cigarettes as close as possible to the real thing.

""Some people ask why we did this,"" said Linda Hennessey, a researcher at Eson Technologies. ""Why? Because this industry is devoted to pushing boundaries and delivering an authentic, top-quality, and eventually deadly product.""

In the wake of several provincial bans on e-cigarette use in public venues, public and government response to this new direction of e-cigarette development  has been strong. Several health organizations have cited the possible risks of making the most popular type of cigarette-substitute highly, and deliberately, carcinogenic.

""I chalk it all up to fear mongering,"" commented Hennessey. ""No rational person is going to go out and purchase a cancer-causing and totally rad, if I may say, product if that's not what they want. But hey, nicotine right?""

When asked what other innovations consumers could expect in the next generation of e-cigarettes, Johnson gave a few clues:

""Well here on the marketing end of things I can definitely tell you that paper is what's in right now. So what you might be seeing is plastic being swapped out for a paper in the majority of products. Of course, if that happens an external heat-source will be required for ignition. But the good folks at the lab are working on some sort of lighter fluid or phosphorus-based gizmo.""

Since testing began, it has been found that the new e-cigarettes cause emphysema, heart disease, and erectile dysfunction as well. When asked to comment, Johnson remarked that these discoveries were “a pleasant bonus.”",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Beaverton,05-28-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/business/item/1874-new-generation-of-e-cigarettes-will-provide-authentic-cancer-experience,11-18-2015
1,Tesla updates cars with auto-road-rage feature,"PAULO ALTO – On the heels of its revolutionary release of autopilot software for its Model S car, electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors has complemented the innovation with an auto-road-rage mode that will allow the car to spontaneously take out its frustrations on other drivers.

“We are one step closer to perfect automation,” said Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, about the implications of this advance. “I estimate that, five to ten years from now, every car on the road will be able to shout verbal abuses, rapidly sound the car horn and even pull out a gun on other drivers completely without human intervention.”

“Cars can drive themselves already,” added Musk. “This was the missing puzzle piece.”

The most significant addition in the new update to the Tesla software is a state-of-the-art text-to-speech engine that can accurately reproduce and respond to human shouting with a vocabulary of one thousand swear words and their combinations. Other sub-capabilities of auto-road-rage are the interplay of a dozen sensors that will allow the car to closely tailgate vehicles it perceives to move slowly, accurately throw projectiles such as coffee cups on other drivers, and extend a mechanical middle finger from either side of the vehicle when necessary.

In response to Tesla’s release, Google announced plans to fit their own self-driving cars with a robotic backseat driver that will regularly remind the car about upcoming stop signs, provide alternate routes that have no guarantee of being faster, and argue with the car about their mutual insecurities.",Business/Technology,Tech Improvements,Beaverton,11-04-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/science-a-tech/item/2206-tesla-updates-cars-with-auto-road-rage-feature,11-18-2015
1,Cool new website aggregates content directly from people’s homes,"NEW YORK - Only six months old and already challenging New Media titans like BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post, the viral media website Stufftaker is overtaking social networks with original content taken right from the locked houses of random strangers.

“We break into your home and steal things that are your property. Then we put them on our website,” said Stufftaker CEO, Josiah Soren. “We get revenue and you get exposure, so it’s a mutual benefit thing.”

Although Stufftaker does not ask permission to use the contents of people’s drawers, rooms and cupboards, the company has a strict citation policy. Every piece shown on the website includes the full name of the original owner, as well as their address, daily routine, and the code to their home security system.

“Stufftaker is really changing the paradigm, and showing that content can be anything,” said tech blogger Yolanda Evon. “Sure, you can watch videos of people’s cats. But now you can have people’s cats.”

“Look at this one. Used to belong to a woman named Michelle. He was all she had. Now he’s yours. Eight bucks, check the website.”

Although critics have accused Stufftaker of plagiarism, Soren has defended his actions, saying he only ever stole from people who couldn’t afford to sue him, like writers, artists, musicians, and the congenitally poor.

Several pieces of Stufftaker’s ‘secondhand content’ have already gathered over twenty million hits each. Among them are:

‘He thought nobody would break into his house, steal the manuscript he’s been working on for 20 years, and publish it on their website under someone else’s name. What happens next, you won’t believe.’

‘Unbelievable! Someone had already robbed this place when we got there. Not!’

‘Check out this dumb kid sleep while we take his shit.’

‘The ten reactions every one of our millions of readers has when they read Linda’s confidential and deeply personal mental health records.’

‘Beautiful: deaf man listens to gunshots for the first time during a B&E gone wrong.’

According to family members, Stanley W.

“My Dad pulled me close last night. His voice was weak, but I clearly and distinctly heard him say, ‘iPhone 6’,” said Patrick McDougall, 34. 

“I asked, ‘you want an iPhone 6?’, he looked into my eyes and slowly nodded his head and whispered, “plus”. 

Sources say that Patrick, his younger brother Damian and sister Jennifer have yet to agree on whether they should purchase a pay-as-you-go plan, or a two-year plan in one of their names and split the up-front cost. 

“I mentioned, just mentioned, that the new Nexus has many of the same features at much less cost, but apparently that was ‘offensive’ and ‘an insult to the man who raised us,’” said Damian, “so I guess we’re getting him an iPhone 6 plus now.

Jennifer McDougall did not share her brother’s hesitation over the purchase.

“Like all terminally ill people Dad simply wants to be able to see the world through a high functioning lens, seize the day with the new Carpe Diem app, and take what will be his final photos with the added benefit of Apple’s new optical image stabilization,” she said.

“I think it’s the least we can do for him.”

1,Astronomers Discover Previously Unknown Cluster Of Nothingness In Deep Space,"WASHINGTON—Saying the finding would further scientists’ understanding of the most remote parts of the universe, NASA astronomers announced at a press conference Thursday that they had discovered a previously unknown cluster of nothingness in deep space. “Through the use of high-resolution infrared imaging, we have identified a large grouping of total emptiness roughly 8.5 billion light-years away that had heretofore gone undetected,” said NASA lead researcher Edward Hefter, adding that the newly discovered blank expanse, which is located between two immense regions of nothing, was far larger and more insignificant in scope than first thought. “We are continuing to investigate the age and origin of the emptiness, but it will be a slow process given that there is absolutely nothing in the cluster to study. However, initial data indicate that the space likely formed when a smaller void merged with a larger vacuum.” Hefter added that the distant cluster of nothingness strongly resembles 481 million similar such regions discovered in recent decades.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Onion,11-19-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/astronomers-discover-previously-unknown-cluster-no-51875,11-26-2015
1,Archaeologists Discover Ancient Femur That Could Make Mouthwatering Broth,"SIBERIA, RUSSIA—Hailing it as among the most intact and substantial Paleolithic-era finds ever unearthed, a team of archaeologists from University College Dublin announced Wednesday the discovery of an ancient human femur that could make a rich, mouthwatering broth. “Based on our preliminary analysis, this thighbone dates back some 65,000 years and appears to be ideal for preparing an enticing, flavorful soup stock that’s hearty and delicious,” said Dr. Harold Brecht, adding that after slowly simmering the recently unearthed prehistoric bone with some sea salt, aromatic vegetables, and a bay leaf, one would have the beginnings of a tasty broth that was at once savory and delicate. “We’ve also found significant evidence that strongly suggests this early femur could be roasted for extra depth of flavor and then tossed into a crock pot with carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and two to three pounds of beef shank for a robust stew that would be delightful on a chilly day. Maybe with some nice, crusty bread to dip in it, too.” Brecht added that he and his research team would have more than enough soup base to last through the winter provided they are able to excavate the remainder of the early human’s skeleton.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Onion,11-04-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/archaeologists-discover-ancient-femur-could-make-m-51784,11-26-2015
1,Biologists Still No Closer To Discovering How Birds Have Sex,"BERKELEY, CA—With not a single scientist having successfully observed the behavior despite extensive ongoing research, the field of biology has made no progress in its understanding of how birds have sex, experts at the University of California told reporters Wednesday.

Through 2,500 years of recorded natural history, hundreds of thousands of hours of fieldwork, and the testing of innumerable hypotheses in regard to the mechanism by which avifauna reproduce, not one instance of bird sex has been reliably documented, photographed, or described, according to the biologists.

“We’ve spent considerable time and effort attempting to unravel the mystery of sex among bird populations, but unfortunately it remains one of the great unanswered questions in our field,” said ornithologist Daniel Abramson, who added that he has studied hundreds of bird species in habitats all across the globe, spending the bulk of his 28-year career staring through binoculars and crouched behind blinds in fruitless attempts to catch them in the act. “We can say for certain that eggs emerge from some part of a bird’s anatomy, and we know baby birds hatch from those eggs. But beyond that, we honestly have no idea how it works.”

“We haven’t ruled out the possibility that the feathers may in fact be the genitals.”

“Do they secrete something onto each other’s feathers and absorb it through their skin?” he continued. “Do they fly very high and have sex so far up in the sky that we’re unable to observe it? At this point, no one can say for sure.”

Abramson’s colleagues echoed his frustration and enumerated the vast array of theories currently being considered. These include the idea that male birds may be fertilizing the eggs in some way after they’ve been laid, as well as the hypothesis that all birds are females that produce clones of themselves. While unable to elaborate any further, the biologists also put forth the possibility that flying in a V formation or perhaps “that thing on turkeys’ necks” has something to do with the process.

A number of experts also reportedly subscribe to the notion that birds are one gender of an entire class of organisms, and bats are the other, complementary, gender.

“Most bird observations occur during the day, but it’s possible that birds are having sex in the middle of the night when it’s very dark and they’re hard to see, or maybe inside clouds where we can’t glimpse them at all—or maybe it occurs both in clouds and at night,” said animal physiologist James Bosley, a proponent of the theory that currently has the most traction among biologists, which suggests that most birds reproduce by flying directly into each other at high speeds. “My own research team is currently looking into whether ducks are doing it under water each time they dip beneath the surface, out of our view.”

“Before that, we looked very carefully at birds that get close to each other and start flapping their wings around a bunch, but it turns out that in those instances they’re usually just pecking at the same piece of food,” he added.

Bosley went on to state that for years, scientists had assumed migratory birds only engaged in sexual intercourse after flying south for the winter, a theory that was later abandoned after a group of North American ornithologists traveled to a conference at the University of São Paulo and met Brazilian colleagues who had long believed the exact opposite to be true.

“At this point, we’re not even sure if birds have genitals,” said Felicia Lopez, a comparative anatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We’ve searched all over their bodies, but there are a lot of feathers down where you would expect something to be, and it makes it pretty hard to see anything. To be honest, though, it doesn’t look like there’s much there at all—just look at how smooth they are. It’s hard to picture where a penis would even go.”

“We haven’t ruled out the possibility that the feathers may in fact be the genitals,” she continued.

Nevertheless, Lopez remarked, biologists remain hopeful, believing that more advanced methodologies will allow them to make the first-ever direct observation of bird sex sooner rather than later.

“It’s only a matter of time before we’re peering through the brush and finally catch sight of birds in the act of copulation,” she said. “As we speak, several of my colleagues are out in the field dressed up like birds and strutting seductively around the animals’ natural habitats in attempts to finally witness bird sex firsthand.”",Health/Science,Hard Science,Onion,10-07-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/biologists-still-no-closer-discovering-how-birds-h-51488,11-26-2015
1,Study: Humans Began Domesticating Animals To Comfort Children Whose Parents Split Up,"LEXINGTON, KY—Providing insight into the customs and social dynamics of prehistoric populations, researchers at the University of Kentucky published a study Friday revealing that humans began domesticating wild animals in order to comfort children whose parents had separated. “According to our findings, our ancient ancestors first tamed and bred gray wolves some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago as a means of providing younger members of their hunter-gatherer societies with a loving companion to keep them occupied and feeling less alone as they dealt with the emotional trauma of their mother and father splitting up,” said lead researcher Ellen Wahl, adding that these early humans were likely inclined to select the most docile and obedient wolf cubs to bring back to their encampments in hopes of distracting these children from the painful changes they were experiencing in their day-to-day lives and the worries they felt about whether they were the cause of the breakup. “Canines would have been an ideal species for these Upper Paleolithic children to connect with during such an emotionally sensitive period given the animal’s loyalty and ability to easily travel along with children as they moved back and forth between their parents’ separate shelters.” Wahl cited further evidence indicating that similar factors may have eventually led to the taming of horses by Bronze Age people, as separated parents began attempting to outdo one another to compete for their children’s affection.",Health/Science,Hard Science,Onion,09-25-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/study-humans-began-domesticating-animals-comfort-c-51391,11-26-2015

1,Scientists at University of the Lord discover that Jesus is Lord,"BARN GLORY, ON - A surprising new study from University of the Lord has revealed that Jesus Christ, and not anybody else, is Lord.

“We started from the premise that somebody had to be Lord,” said lead pastorologist Hal Holmes. “After that, it was pretty much just a process of elimination. Kanye West wasn’t Lord, and Jack Nicholson certainly wasn’t. Sooner or later, Jesus’s was the only name left on the list.”

While the scientists were quick to remind members of the press that they were legally required to remind members of the press that University of the Lord was not a 'University, per se,' nor were they 'Scientists in any meaningful definition of that term', they nevertheless support their findings, on the grounds that 'Nobody questions it when University of Toronto makes a discovery for Satan.'

“We used a multidisciplinary approach to find out who did and didn’t belong on the list,” said Dot Jameson, senior antipalaeontologist at UotL. “The techniques we utilized included reading the bible, singing ‘Michael Row Your Boat Ashore’ and badly misusing ideas from physics.”

This is not the first time that researchers at the university have arrived at astonishing conclusions. In the last two years alone, UotL also turned multi-billion dollar grants into confirmation that The Lord Is Risen, that Christ Is King, and that The Lord Is Risen Indeed, Alleluia.

1,New study finds that you fucked with the wrong scientists,"OTTAWA - A recent discovery has shown that you fucked with the wrong practitioners of hypothetico-deductive methodology.

“As in all science, we started by formulating a question: how badly did you just fuck up?” said lead researcher Jack Hardnails, PhD, snuffing out a cigarette on the bare skin of his forearm. “Our hypothesis was, you’re going to find out how badly when we lay this down on you, prison-style.”

Sources say that the testing and experimentation stage involved baseball bats, a wrecking bar, speed metal, and copious amounts of note-taking.

“Of course we employed numerous controls,” said Ruth Butcher, lead statistician, while doing one-handed knuckle-pushups. “Chains, zipties; scientific philosopher Karl Popper recommends these things in The Lesson of this Beatdown of the Fucking Century.”

Scientists say that the implications of this research are wide-reaching, with potential applications in the fields of Kicking Ass, Taking Names, and Botany.

“It’s an exciting time to be working in the sciences,” said Professor Dolph Sledgehammer, carving the word “Loco” into his chest with a flick-knife. “We’re delving into the deepest mysteries of physics and biology and if you look at me in the eyes I will cut off your face, I will slice around the edges of your face and tear it off like a band-aid, ese.”

1,Girlfriend scientists find 99% of food too spicy,"GUELPH, ON - Research done by girlfriend scientists at the University of Guelph has uncovered that nearly all food is far too hot and/or spicy.

The study involved the tasting of hundreds of normally available foods, of which only a miniscule fraction were deemed edible and not dangerous for human ingestion.

“We are glad to have finally reached some firm conclusions in this important area,” said Dr. Lucy de Souza as she chugged milk in between gasps after testing some mild chicken wings.

A large variety of foods were tested; although habanero peppers, Italian sausage, and every form of Indian cuisine were summarily deemed dangerous without testing as scientists didn’t want to get any on their hands.

Other foods, despite not being spicy, were still ruled to be unsafe due to having “a weird texture.”

The study seems to have sparked a debate within the scientific community that won’t be going away soon.

1,Federal election campaign enters third geological age,"OTTAWA – Two renowned Canadian geologists published a high-profile paper this morning finding that, with three weeks to Election Day, the 2015 federal campaign has officially outlasted two major geological time periods.

“It’s truly amazing,” says Anthony Costopoulos, Professor at the University of Ottawa’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, “Normally these elections just feel agonizingly slow – but here we have scientific proof that this one actually is.""

Costopoulos’ co-author, Professor Peter Chrisomalis, explained the discovery: “When you look at a section of rock, you’ll see these lines. Those are strata, and each of them is a deposition of mineral. Over millions of years, different strata pile up, and that group of strata corresponds to a geological age. Then, a few more million years, and another age, and then another. That’s how long this fucking election has been.”

The paper confirms similar results from a team of paleontologists at the University of Alberta who, last week, discovered a beetle preserved in amber and dated it back to just after the writ drop. “This beetle”, they concluded, “died a long, long time ago.

1,MPAA Adds New Rating To Warn Audiences Of Films Not Based On Existing Works,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to provide moviegoers with the information they need to determine which films are appropriate for them to see, the Motion Picture Association of America announced Tuesday the addition of a new rating to alert audiences of movies that are not based on existing works.

According to MPAA officials, the new “O,” or “Original,” designation will inform viewers that a particular film contains characters with whom they are unfamiliar, previously unseen settings, and novel plots. The rating will also reportedly serve as a warning of the potentially disorienting effects associated with having to remember characters’ names for as many as two hours and the discomfort that can occur when one is forced to keep track of narrative arcs for an entire film.

“It’s simply a value-neutral designation intended to protect consumers, ensuring that they are fully informed about a movie and are able to make their own decisions about how much artistic and narrative originality they are comfortable seeing.”
“We recognize how distressing it can be when viewers go into a film and suddenly find themselves confronted with jarring scenes containing a protagonist they’ve never encountered before, which is precisely why we created this rating,” said Joan Graves, head of the MPAA’s ratings board, who said the new category was added in part due to the thousands of complaints the organization has received from moviegoers who were upset they weren’t given advance notice that they’d have to make sense of the scenarios unfolding onscreen. “It’s important that today’s movie fans are aware upon entering the theater that none of what they will see has been adapted from a well-known comic book, television series, novel, video game, historical event, previous movie, or theme park ride.”

“Ultimately, it will be up to the consumer’s discretion as to whether a film is suitable for themselves and their family, but the O rating will explicitly caution people that they will have to pay attention during the movie and follow the storyline on their own,” Graves added.

Though sources said films requiring the new rating are comparatively rare, a spate of high-profile movies over the past several years that do not stem from any previously existing source material—including The Kids Are All Right, Her, WALL-E, Birdman, and Nebraska, among others—have left many viewers angered and perplexed. Citing test audiences they have observed, MPAA officials said that many moviegoers spent the entirety of such films in a state of distress, waiting for the moment when the Incredible Hulk, Katniss Everdeen, Wolverine, or another recognizable character from an established franchise would appear onscreen and clarify the meaning and direction of the film.

“I never would have gone to see Sicario if I knew it was going to be so unbearable,” said filmgoer Mark Kemmer of Cleveland, referring to the recently released crime thriller set against the violent backdrop of the contemporary Mexican drug trade that, under the MPAA’s guidelines, would receive the new rating. “It was pretty much unwatchable. It seemed like in nearly every scene I had to figure out who the people were and where the story was going. And the whole movie was like that!”

“What a waste of money,” he added.

Others reported being viscerally repulsed by movies they attended that were not based on media that originated several decades or generations earlier, saying they had become so upset by what they had seen that they had trouble even sitting through the films.

“How does this trash even get made?” said Katherine Hubbard, a mother of three from Rockford, IL, who, after buying tickets for the Pixar film Inside Out, was incensed that her children had been exposed to original storytelling. “Within the first minute, some little girl character my kids have never seen or heard of walks onscreen, and then we immediately have to learn her whole backstory and how she navigates the world? I marched us all right out of that theater after about 10 minutes.”

While audiences have reportedly been receptive to the new rating, directors and distributors have already decried it as severely damaging in regard to box-office revenues and the number of venues that will carry their films. However, the MPAA was adamant that the new classification should not be interpreted as censorship.

“The O rating isn’t meant to be a punishment or a moral judgment of any kind,” Graves said. “It’s simply a value-neutral designation intended to protect consumers, ensuring that they are fully informed about a movie and are able to make their own decisions about how much artistic and narrative originality they are comfortable seeing.”

“If filmmakers want to avoid the rating and appeal to a wider audience, all they have to do is throw in a superhero or a hobbit or some other licensed property,” Graves added.",Soft News,Entertainment,Onion,10-20-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/mpaa-adds-new-rating-warn-audiences-films-not-base-51651,11-29-2015

1,Robert De Niro Stunned To Learn Of Man Who Can Quote ‘Goodfellas’,"NEW YORK—Immediately halting production on his latest project after hearing of the incredible talent, legendary actor Robert De Niro was reportedly stunned to learn Wednesday that Bayonne, NJ resident Eric Sullivan, 33, can quote the critically acclaimed 1990 Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas at length.

Witnesses confirmed that De Niro, who played gangster Jimmy Conway in the movie, refused to continue with the filming of HBO’s upcoming Bernie Madoff biopic, The Wizard Of Lies, until the gifted man could be brought before the actor to demonstrate his singular ability to repeat sections of dialogue from the Academy Award–winning crime drama.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa—you’re saying this guy can recite 15 or 20 lines from the movie, fully and completely, without messing up or having to stop even once?” said De Niro after rushing over to a crew member who he had overheard telling several coworkers about Sullivan’s skill. “He can just reel off the dialogue, word for word? From all the biggest scenes?”

“Find him now—do whatever you gotta do to get him here, ASAP,” De Niro added after calling over his assistant and whispering urgently in her ear.

After learning that the man had been known to recite lines along with the film while it played, as well as repeat entire monologues when hanging out with his buddies at a bar, De Niro was reportedly further shocked to find out that Sullivan was also able to call on his ability in a casual workplace setting, with his family during holiday visits, and, on rare occasion, while ordering fast food at a drive-thru window—all without the aid of a script.

De Niro, who discovered that Sullivan was not a famous entertainer but instead an unmarried sales associate at a Jersey City–area Verizon Wireless location, was said to be so astonished that he was rendered incapable of speech for several minutes.

“So you’re saying I could deliver a line from the scene where Billy starts busting Tommy’s balls and he could deliver the exact response, just like that?” De Niro said after regaining his composure. “And he does the accents and even gets all the pauses and hand gestures right? How have I never heard of this guy before?”

De Niro then reportedly made a phone call to the assistant he had just dispatched to find Sullivan, telling her to reserve the penthouse suite at the Plaza Hotel for the incredible man and saying that he would meet Sullivan there shortly.

“Actually, on second thought, don’t put him in a hotel—take him to my place in Tribeca,” the two-time Oscar winner said. “I want him to stay with me for a while. And don’t take no for an answer.”

Before placing several more phone calls to Goodfellas co-stars Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci about the man’s prowess, De Niro reportedly speculated that he and Sullivan might immediately become good friends. The actor is said to have given considerable thought to this possibility, especially after learning that Sullivan knew several pieces of miscellaneous production trivia about the film, including the fact that Martin Scorsese’s actual mother had played Pesci’s character’s mother, that Nora Ephron’s comedic Steve Martin vehicle My Blue Heaven was based on the same story as Goodfellas, and that Ray Liotta would listen to FBI wiretap recordings of the real Henry Hill to help get into character.

“People must constantly be bothering him to do the ‘You think I’m funny?’ scene in the bar—I know I’d never get tired of hearing it,” De Niro said. “I honestly can’t believe he even does a dead-on Paul Sorvino impression—I’ve tried, and it’s impossible. And how can he do that at the same time he’s remembering all the lines?”

Sources said De Niro then deliberated for several minutes, wondering whether he should immediately head to Sullivan’s home to see the man in his element and witness the incredible feat in person.

At press time, De Niro was reportedly outraged to learn that Sullivan was en route to Newark Liberty International Airport at the behest of comedy legend Mel Brooks, who insisted that Sullivan immediately fly to Los Angeles after Brooks learned that he could recite the entirety of the 1987 Star Wars spoof Spaceballs.",Soft News,Entertainment,Onion,11-11-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/robert-de-niro-stunned-learn-man-who-can-quote-goo-51823,11-29-2015

1,Nation waits for more Bill Cosbys to come forward before believing Bill Cosby rape accusations,"HOLLYWOOD - Following the release of documents revealing that Bill Cosby himself admitted to obtaining prescription Quaaludes to have sex with women, a skeptical nation has resolved to give the beloved entertainer the benefit of the doubt unless further Bill Cosbys come forward. 

Newly released documents, from a 2005 civil suit, show that actor and comedian Bill Cosby admitted under oath to purchasing sedatives to give to women for sexual purposes. While some are calling this a damning admission by Bill Cosby himself, the vast majority of Americans maintain that testimony from only one Bill Cosby does not prove his guilt. Megyn Kelly of Fox And Friends commented that, barring testimony from further Bill Cosbys, this remains a ""Bill Cosby said, Bill Cosby said situation"".

Fan reaction to the admission has proven similarly skeptical. ""I understand that Bill Cosby himself admitted to obtaining controlled substances to drug women for sex,"" said Mark Alpert, systems analyst and self-professed Cosby Show fan. ""But how do we know he's telling the truth? Maybe Bill Cosby had a sexual experience he regretted, and just made up this story about drugging and raping dozens of women. Innocent until proven guilty, I say.""

A recent poll showed that a majority of Americans were still unconvinced by Bill Cosby's admission that he acquired controlled substances to administer to women. Forty percent of respondents said they would require ""ten or more"" Bill Cosbys to come forward, while thirty-five percent of respondents would ""only believe Bill Cosby if Bill Cosby brought charges against Bill Cosby and Bill Cosby was then convicted in a court of law"".

Several men's advocacy groups rushed to defend Bill Cosby, while condemning Bill Cosby's assault claims. ""Statistics show that instances of Bill Cosbys making false rape accusations are actually very common,"" explained Jared Dillon, president of the group More Equality For Men. ""Likely this is just some gold-digging Bill Cosby hoping to capitalize off of accusing an innocent Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Happens all the time.""

California law enforcement officials concede that finding further Bill Cosbys to testify has proven difficult, particularly considering the ""lineup of women who've been waiting for years.""",Soft News,Entertainment,Beaverton,07-07-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/world/item/1952-nation-waits-for-more-bill-cosbys-to-come-forward-before-believing-bill-cosby-rape-accusations,11-29-2015

The child, who will be fifth in line for the Royal throne, is expected to be born in late January of next year, around the same time as his younger sister is due to be conceived.

“She already has that rosy-cheeked glow,” said one friend of the proud yet again mother-to-be. “Or else she’s still flushed with the effort of forcing out a baby. Maybe it’s a bit of both.”

In celebration of the announcement, the Royal Mint, Royal Canadian Mint, and Royal Australian Mint have all released commemorative coins featuring an engorged Prince William shoving aside a terrified medical attendant in order to get at his wife, while a stork chain smokes cigarettes in the background.",Soft News,Entertainment,Beaverton,05-02-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/world/item/1842-kate-middleton-immediately-pregnant-again,11-29-2015
1,Geriatric riot erupts after Stuart Mclean show cancelled,"EDMONTON -- A live show of Stuart Mclean’s Vinyl Cafe show scheduled to appear in Edmonton was cancelled causing a riot among disappointed octogenarians and retirees .

After the venue announced that Mclean was unable to make the show due to a flight delay, many ticked off, grey-haired, story-lovers congregated around the public library where canes and walkers were intentionally thrown at windows and public property.

“I paid $10 to see this show and then this 67-year-old young punk blows us off like we’re nobody!” exclaimed Chester, an 83-year-old retiree who had looked forward to hearing new stories about the adventures of Dave and Morley. “What a rip-off! We want our money back!”

The civil disobedience further escalated when a group of disaffected grandmothers smashed the windows of a fine wool and yarn shop and grabbed many fine fibres.

“The ensuing riot was definitely fueled by prescription medication,” explained Constable Calista Tangerberry of the Edmonton Police Service. “Or lack of it. We’re not sure.”

Police quelled the rowdy crowd back with very, very loud-speakers and reassurances that their children will call them soon.

According to sources, the nonagenarians were blaming those no-good kids born in the late 40s. ",Soft News,Entertainment,Beaverton,10-28-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/local/item/2186-geriatric-riot-erupts-after-stuart-mclean-show-cancelled,11-29-2015
1,Nation just trying to keep Uncle Dave off the topic of Caitlyn Jenner,"NATIONWIDE - With Caitlyn Jenner’s courageous gender transition making worldwide headlines, the nation is just desperately trying to keep Uncle Dave from sharing his opinions on the issue with anyone.

“Caitlyn Jenner? Well just let me tell you a little something about Caitlyn Jenner,” Uncle Dave started, before Sandra Greene of Biggar, Sk. brought up his ex-wife Jolene as a surefire way to change the subject.

Dave, 46, still seems to be invited to most of the nation’s family functions, despite the fact that he seems to be offensively wrong about everything it is possible to be wrong about, and even some things where the concept of truth value does not seem to apply.

“Yesterday, he told me about what kinds of rocks were for homos,” said Gene Lau of Corner Brook, NL. “What could that possibly even mean?”

Although there have been more and more close calls as Dave has pounded a growing number of cans of Busch, so far the country has managed to stop him from running his dumb hick mouth about Caitlyn Jenner.

“Every time he gets close, you just have to steer the conversation back to Obama,” said Jacques Valmont, of Drummondville, Qc. “Usually, that’ll buy you a good fifteen minutes.”

“Well not ‘good’. Tolerable.”

Experts have recommended the nation just ride this out for a few more hours, because after that it won’t have to see him again until its cousin’s wedding in July.",Soft News,Entertainment,Beaverton,06-03-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/local/item/1892-nation-just-trying-to-keep-uncle-dave-off-the-topic-of-caitlyn-jenner,11-29-2015

“Personally, I thought I should interview a Canadian icon on the first episode. Someone like Sarah Polley, David Cronenberg or Feist,” said Shad. “But CBC was like ‘hey, how about we try something original and cool?’ Fair enough, that is what Q is known for doing.”

The CBC statement also said that listeners can expect an exciting first episode, with Shad asking hard-hitting questions like “will you please confirm that our relationship was entirely consensual and that that consent was informed?” and offering fun, accurate definitions for words like “consent” and “informed”.

“Despite this strange first interview, I’m extremely excited about this opportunity,” said Shad. “Everyone is being so supportive! All the women in the office are saying I’m already the best host this show has ever had.”

The CBC has also offered their congratulations to Shad, stating that they’re thrilled to finally have a relevant Canadian artist in charge.",Soft News,Entertainment,Beaverton,03-11-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/national/item/1782-new-q-host-s-first-interview-will-be-all-his-former-sexual-partners,11-29-2015

1,"Wall Street Firm Develops New High-Speed Algorithm Capable Of Performing Over 10,000 Ethical Violations Per Second","NEW YORK—Calling it a major breakthrough that will significantly expedite and streamline its daily operations, Wall Street financial firm Goldman Sachs revealed Thursday it has developed a new high-speed algorithm that is capable of performing more than 10,000 ethical violations per second. “With this new automated program, we’ll be able to systematically deceive investors, engage in conflicts of interest, and execute thousands of other blatantly unethical dealings in the time it takes to press a button,” said John Waldron, co-head of Goldman Sachs’ investment banking division, who added that the high-frequency impropriety system will be able to break more rules in a minute than an entire floor of morally suspect securities traders, financial analysts, and portfolio managers could over the course of a week. “In the past, if one of our brokers wanted to exploit a questionably legal regulatory loophole or breach the covenant of good faith with an investment client, that would require hours of manually contravening the basic principles of professional integrity. But this innovative system will allow millions of such transgressions to go through every single day.

1,Study Finds 68% Of Americans Unprepared For Sudden Financial Stability,"AMES, IA—Noting that most Americans never consider the possibility that such life-altering circumstances could ever befall them, a study published Monday by researchers at Iowa State University revealed that 68 percent of citizens are wholly unprepared for a sudden bout of financial stability. “We found that, given their lack of any forethought or preparation for such a scenario, roughly two-thirds of Americans would be completely blindsided by an unexpected increase in their monthly net income, which would have an immediate impact on every single financial decision they make,” said the report’s lead author, Rebecca Linsky, who added that, when abruptly faced with an unforeseen solvent patch, a majority of Americans would quickly find themselves racked by stressful choices regarding which luxuries to spend their extra money on after paying their rent and other bills. “Many people never see a comfortable shift in their finances coming, and in the face of such positive cash flow, have little choice but to make sharp, unanticipated adjustments, such as no longer cutting back on little things like eating out and going to movies.” Linsky emphasized, however, that thanks to the current economic environment and prevailing government policies, most citizens would likely never have to experience such a jarring period of financial security.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Onion,10-19-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/study-finds-68-americans-unprepared-sudden-financi-51613,01-03-2016

1,Economists Recommend Setting Aside Part Of Every Paycheck In Case Of Dire Straits Reunion Tour,"WASHINGTON—Describing the precaution as a financially prudent decision for all households, a panel of the nation’s top economists recommended Wednesday that Americans set aside money from each paycheck so they will be ready in the event Dire Straits reunites for a tour. “We suggest placing a small percentage of your earnings into a separate account to ensure you have adequate savings should Dire Straits unexpectedly announce a string of North American concert dates to promote a new greatest-hits double album,” said Princeton University economics professor Julia Bridges, adding that at any moment, an unforeseen reconciliation between singer-guitarist Mark Knopfler and bassist John Illsley could precipitate a reunion that would leave millions scrambling to cover the cost of presale tickets. “While this year saw the 30th anniversary of Brothers In Arms pass by uneventfully, that still doesn’t rule out the possibility of the band’s first tour since 1992 suddenly hitting arenas in major cities across the United States. Sadly, many Americans would struggle to afford decent seats if Dire Straits played a show in their town today, let alone purchase basic merchandise such as commemorative reunion hats and T-shirts. This would leave them at risk of missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the classic ‘Sultans Of Swing’ guitar solo up close and in person.” Bridges advised that, at the very least, Americans keep a small pool of emergency reserves on hand should Cheap Trick or REO Speedwagon come to their local fairgrounds.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Onion,11-18-2015,http://www.theonion.com/article/economists-recommend-setting-aside-part-every-payc-51865,01-03-2016
1,"Report: Decreased interest rate will cause Canadian calendar increase of 2.7 days, or something","In the wake of the Bank of Canada’s recent interest rate cut and wide speculation about its impact on inflation, the housing market, and the economy as a whole, overwhelmed experts are now predicting that Canada’s calendar will be expected to increase by 2.5 to 3 days, or kind of maybe something along those lines.

“We don’t know for certain how great this interest rate will cause uh, you know, increases or decreases,” said Financial Analyst Jay Lamb. “But my guess is, with a change to the economy this drastic, I’d say we’re looking at a minimum 2 days’ calendar loss, probably at the extremely early or late margins of the year. Yeah, that would seem to make the most sense.”

Andy Marsh gave his take on the situation at a local bar in Vancouver. “It’s like, if I have $50, and then I loan you $50, we both have $50, then that’s pretty much inflation, right? So just imagine that, but across the whole economy, and you know… some crazy stuff’s gonna happen. You think our system of measuring solar revolutions isn’t going to be affected? That’s just how it is.”

Marsh added, “and that’s not even factoring in what the price of oil…adds…subtracts…has to do with it.”

Meanwhile, some analysts are extolling the usefulness of the calendar drop. “Canadians have been basking in a 24-hour days economy a while now. But subtracting a few minutes from a day can actually increase calendar growth because people are more willing to spend less time on tasks, so at the end of the year there’s less time, and that makes time more valuable,” said economist Sheldon Marek. After a brief pause, he added, “And...let’s just go with that.”

At press time, the question of whether the falling value of the Loonie would cause an increase or decrease in the number of vacation days Canadians get a year remained unanswered.

1,China now outperforming U.S. at economic meltdowns,"BEIJING – Following decades of surpassing the United States in education, manufacturing, and international trade, China is now outperforming its American rivals at economic meltdowns.

“It’s super frustrating,” admits Jason Goldstein, an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. “After everything we did to cripple the global economy back in ’08, we genuinely believed that we’d positioned America as the biggest threat to global financial stability.  But it turns out, China’s even the best at being the worst.”

Now Goldstein worries that China may set its sights on other traditionally U.S.-dominated fields.

“What’s next? Are they going to beat us at mass shootings?  Police brutality? Waging fraudulent wars as a pretext for annexing an oil-rich nation’s resources?” he asked rhetorically. ""Two days ago, I’d have told you there’s no way.  Now, I don’t know what to believe.”

1,Study: 30% of Millennials already squatting in their dream homes,"MONTREAL - A new study from McGill shows that Canada's economy may be bouncing back, finding that nearly one-third of Millennials are already illegally living in million, or multimillion, dollar houses abandoned during the recession.

""It was a long hard road,"" said Gregory Moss, a 26-year old being paid in ‘experience’. ""But I finally made it.""

This study is welcome news for many young workers who feel that things such as housing and food are out of their price range. Dr. Travis Lorry, the head of the study and tenured professor of economics at McGill, says that his results indicate that poorer Millennials simply aren't working hard enough to steal higher-end housing.

“A young professional shouldn’t let a little thing like ‘being forced to work for free’ get in the way of living inside a beautiful house,” explained Dr. Lorry. “The marketplace will reward tenacity and hard work, if not with money, than with hobo bindles, some very comfortable old newspapers, and great recipes for nail soup.”

Many Millennials have noticed the upswing in the economy and are beginning to make plans for the future.

“I got my first non-can of beans paycheck today,” said Lindsey Nguyen, 27. “It’s not much, but it’s definitely enough for me to think about not starting a family or owning a car in the next five years.”

Adding to the good news, the Ontario Ministry of Labour reports that most Millennials have access to heat in the form of trashcan fires, and that 15% have already taken in foundlings in order to extend their pickpocket empires.",Business/Technology,Banking / Finance,Beaverton,02-10-2015,http://www.thebeaverton.com/national/item/1750-study-30-of-millennials-already-squatting-in-their-dream-homes,01-04-2016

1,Greece fakes own death to get out of paying debt,"GREECE - The IMF has been forced to swallow huge amounts of debt after it was discovered that all of Greece had mysteriously been killed by tragic falls, wine cask explosions, capsized boats, unidentified murders, arson, and animal attacks.

“The real tragedy is that we haven't been able to identify any suspects in any of last night’s 11 million deaths,” said IMF coroner John Lipsky. “Also, it seems like all of Greece’s security cameras were disabled. We may never know what happened to these poor people.”

“Emphasis on ‘poor’.”

While some believe the timing of the deaths to be suspicious, most point out that Greek PM, Alexis Tsipras, had made multiple statements about being “excited to pay back the IMF” and how he was “really looking forward to the private firework display [he] had organized.” Unfortunately, Tsipras was killed over the weekend in a freak firework explosion.

“We went looking for a debt repayment early Monday but all the banks were closed,” said IMF head Christine Lagarde. “Apparently every bank manager in the country met with an untimely demise last night,” she added without noticing the corpse of the bank manager’s eyes opening to check if she was still there.

“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” added retriever Laurelei, as she ran laps around the dog park.

The unanimous decision of goodness marked a joyous turnaround at the end of a harrowing Thursday. For several hours, all of the dogs had believed their owners had deserted them forever when they left for work that morning.

“I was so scared,” explained Sasha the boxer. “At first I was like ‘where are you going?’ and then I fell asleep, and then I woke up and I was like ‘I would like some water’ and then while having some water I was pretty sure I saw a squirrel so I barked for a good 15, and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and I was scared again, but I couldn’t remember why.”

Upon the sound of keys jingling outside the door, dogs across the board began happy-hind-leg dances as they realized walkies were forthcoming. 

“For me, it is a sacred time of day,” waxed Werner the German Shepherd. “I like to do my part: oftentimes, I will grab my leash from its hook and run around the apartment, as if to say ‘I am helping! I am helping!’ until my human can catch me, wrestle the leash from my mighty jaws, and attach it to my collar.”

Added Werner, “It is a sensational game which captures in a microcosm the frailty of the relationship between animal and man.”

“When it was only -15°C back in July we didn’t have to worry about this,” said Palluq, reached at his home in Igloolik. “But these dogs just can’t grip when the temperature drops past -50°C. I guess that’s what I get for buying off-brand huskies.”

Igloolik, the starting point for the 2014 Nunavut Quest dog sled race, still has several residents who prefer using dog sleds over cars and skidoos. Proponents say that, in addition to being more environmentally friendly, the dogs almost never need de-icing or waxing. However, canine-based transport comes with its own dangers.

“I used to use all-season dogs until my brother caused a 48-mutt pile-up when he skidded into an intersection near Kugluktuk,” said Palluq. “Now that Nunavut’s population has spiked above 30,000 we have to worry about safety. There’s literally dozens of other vehicles on the road. We can’t keep sledding like we’re on country tundra.”

“On the evening of the 31st, an nine-year-old child reported to her parents that she found a non-edible, non-sugar coated oral hygiene instrument inserted intentionally to her trick-or-treat bag,” said Sgt.

1,"All hockey parents must be accompanied with a responsible child, decrees local arena","VICTORIA - A Victoria arena’s policy has ruled that all hockey parents must be escorted by a responsible child at all times while they are on the premises. 

“We’ve had several instances where parents and legal guardians have been using inappropriate language, threats and even violence,” said arena manager Juuso Martin of the Q Centre. “Many of us were asking why were there so many adults running around without being supervised by children who are far more mature and responsible than than they are. Hence, we had to implement a rule like this.” 

The responsible children are expected to keep watch over their hockey parents before, during and after the game and ensure parents understand that sportsmanship and not swearing is much better than winning or keying the opposing coach's car in the parking lot. However, not every parent seemed to get the message.

“You stupid shithead!” screamed one parent at the seventeen year old referee for not calling a penalty.

“Dad, if I hear that word one more time out of your mouth, there will be no beer for you for a month!” scorned seven year old Madison Young-Tomosho  at her father, Mark. “Don’t make me wash your mouth out with soap again. If you don’t start smartening up, Dad, so help me God...”

“This isn’t fair,” moaned the forty year old insurance adjuster while kicking the back of the bleacher.

Parents will also have a curfew of 9 pm after which no one above the age of 18 will be able to watch the games.

1,Breaking News: Tough guy can’t take a joke,"In a move that reaffirms stereotypes accross the world, local ‘Jacked’ guy and gym owner Rob King has again proven that big guys can’t take a joke.

The owner of Heavyweights gym is now going to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in what he claims is a case of defamation. King is requesting that the court reveal the identity of the person who created parody accounts on Twitter and Facebook for him and his business, claiming that their intent was malicious and meant to negatively affect his business.

The court is currently under deliberation, wondering if they can in fact trust Mr. King’s promise where he stated “I won’t beat him up, I swear!”.

King is now entering the territory of the Guiness Book of World Record’s for confirming the most stereotypes. His earlier research on whether people who took massive amounts of steroids are more aggressive was confirmed when he faced a second court appearance following his charge of importing illegal steroids, for threatening a former employee after their testimony.

He said “we’re going to fight whether you want to fight or not,” to a former employee after that employee published his testimony on Facebook. “You’re lucky you’re not dead tonight.”

The employee said King was poking him in the chest and was trying to intimidate him.

Mr. King also has an on-going lawsuit versus the entire World’s news industry for publishing articles about New Year’s fitness resolutions resulting in gym memberships that go unused.

“That can’t tell people that! It’s our industries biggest revenue stream! It’s all profit as there is no time or services required.”

The Codfish would like to congratulate Mr. King on approaching his stereotype record and would also like to inform him that we have nothing to do with the parody accounts and that this too is a simple joke.

1,"Trudeau congratulates O’Regan on alcohol-free lifestyle, celebrates by sharing a doobie","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is voicing his support to Liberal MP Seamus O’Regan after the newly elected MP said he had entered a program to adopt “an alcohol-free lifestyle.”

O’Regan announced from his Twitter account that he had checked into the program over the holiday break. To seize the opportunity to appear open, transparent, and progressive and to avoid any media backlash or blunders, the Prime Minister made the journey to meet O’Regan. Trudeau quickly ran his hand through his hair, threw-on the latest Banana Republic winter line, and redirected a jet full of refugees to head to the island province.

After the press conference the Prime Minister commented on the importance of impartiality and responsibility to constituents while happily passing around a few joints hand-rolled by the liberal youth club.  Media on the scene reported on Sophie Trudeau’s gorgeous and stylish oven mitts as she exited the plane to the event carrying a load of fresh baked goods.

While nobody is surprised that a man named Seamus O’Regan has a potential problem with alcohol dependency; opinions at home are skewed. A newly created online petition started by several members of O’Regan’s constituency in Newfoundland is calling for his resignation based on the fact that ‘The boy cannot even hold his liqour’.",N/A,N/A,Codfish,01-04-2016,http://www.thecodfish.com/topics/politics/2016/01/trudeau-oregan-alcohol-free-share-a-doobie/,02-11-2016
1,How to: Warm-up your vehicle faster during the winter,"It’s never harder to drag your ass out of bed and begin the long commute to work than it is during the winter months. Not only are you dreading another 8 hour, montanonous day from the time you wake up, but now you have to venture out into the cold, clean off a vehicle and sit in a cold car for ages while in bumper to bumper traffic.

Well what if you could optimize this process to improve your morning?

For thousands of years, humans in northern regions have embraced snow for its properies as a great insulator. Northern Aboriginals, trappers and many more have even went as far to build some of their primary shelters from snow!  The air trapped inside the crystalized water particles acts as an insulating layer to help keep heat locked in.

So how does this help you? Every morning when you wake up and dust the snow off your car, your removing natures generous gift of insulation! Leave the snow on your car to allow the air trapped inside to warm up much more rapidly. Forget that extra visability, the safety of other drivers (they are of course the shitty drivers, it couldn’t possibly be you) and pedestrians (who lets face it, should be bowing down to your superiority as the owner of $20,000 of modern engineering).

Not only does it help keep your buns toasty warm during your commute but it also saves precious seconds off the time it takes to get moving in the morning. Now you can use this seconds doing things you enjoy such as ignoring your spouse while playing games, or interacting with other conceded people via the internet on your 7 inch phone. Hell, why not do it in your snow insulated automobile? Theres no chance the police can see you using it now!

The advantages are endless!",N/A,N/A,Codfish,02-16-2015,http://www.thecodfish.com/topics/culture-lifestyle/2015/02/how-to-warm-your-vehicle-up-faster/,02-11-2016
1,Bell Aliant taps into innovative new revenue stream,"Bell Aliant shares rose 5 points today after analysts calculated expected revenues based on their new customer service charge. The new charge is based on a model that requires the company to provide no alternative product or choice of service to consumers, and then charge them for making (or in this case, not making) that choice.

In this case, residents of Nova Scotia who wish to purchase high-speed internet service are no longer given the option to have a contract,  and are then subjected to an extra $10 per month ‘No-contract Fee’ on their bill.

“It’s ingenious!” says one Nova Scotia Economist. “They are making revenue off a fee for NOT providing a service. They give customers no option or choice and charge them extra for making that one, single selection they had no choice but to make.”

The fee was originally labelled ‘Unethical Price Gouge’ but the company’s marketing department said it didn’t fair as well in focus groups.

Bell Aliant, is one among dozens of major television providers who are being affected by people ‘cutting the cord’ on cable/television services and chosing alternative services such as Over-The-Air television, or internet streaming services such as Netflix.

“People used to use our phone services, television and Internet.” says a teary-eyed spokesperson for the company. “Now they use cell-phones with whoever they want (although we have the majority of the market share in the region), and then use our internet service (As we are one out of two options) to watch television shows offered by someone else for cheaper. It’s not fair! Not fair!”

After some minor stomping, sniffling and a cookie the spokesperson resumed the interview and calmly stated “So to get those bastards we throttled our internet speeds, up’ed the cost of our internet services and added unethical fee’s until the cost of ‘just internet’ would be almost on par with a bundled service. This gives customers the option to pay for extra for services they don’t want just like in the good old days of TV Channel Bundles. That’s is always an easier sell than paying outrageous fees for just the service they need.”",N/A,N/A,Codfish,01-22-2015,http://www.thecodfish.com/topics/business-economy/2015/01/bell-aliant-taps-into-innovative-new-revenue-stream/,02-11-2016

1,GLOBAL ALLEN SUPPLY AT ALL-TIME LOW,"GENEVA, SWITZERLAND—The global supply of Allens, Allans, Alans, and certain types of Als is at an all-time low, according to a team of UN experts named Allen. While the world’s population has hit an all-time high at 7.4 billion, the current number of Allens has plummeted to the lowest it’s been in over a century. 

“I mean, do you know any young guys named Allen?” asks Allen Walker, sociologist and author of The Allen Apocalypse. “I bet they’re like 60, right? Maybe your dad or your uncle. But no one knows a five-year-old Al. And that’s utterly terrifying.”

Allen populations peaked in the 1940s and 50s when Allen and its variations accounted for up to 5,000 names per million children born in the U.S. alone. That number has been declining ever since, with sharper decreases in the 70s, possibly due to the economic effects of the oil crisis.

Experts warn that if rates continue to plummet, the world could be Allenless by 2050. “Or earlier,” warns Walker. “If you had too many Allens together in one place, say at Disneyland, or a big barbecue just for people named Al, and there was an earthquake at that place… well, Allens could be wiped out overnight.”

According to Allen historian Allen Brown, Allens used to roam the prairies and Midwest in herds the size of small states, over 10 million strong, but those days are long gone. “Nowadays if you meet an Al or an Allen, it’s like, wow. I need a minute. This is just way too exciting.”

The recent death of beloved actor Alan Rickman has brought new attention to the worldwide Allen shortage. Adds Brown, “His passing has only compounded the problem for all Allens. Spelling is no protection against this dark art.”

While Walker lauds efforts of some to increase Allen numbers, Brown worries it’s a case of too little, too late. “People say they want to help, but then they give their kid “Allen” as a middle name. Sorry, that just doesn’t cut it. Neither does naming your cat Al — if anything it hurts the cause, really.”

Both men cite a 2009 BBC viral video featuring a prairie dog as a major blow to the name’s chances for a comeback. “You try to engage with people about the name, and they just start yelling ‘Allen! Allen! Allen! Steve! Steve! Steve!’ and laughing hysterically. How do you rebut that?”

However, there may be hope on the horizon. A team of researchers at Stanford University announced plans last week to study women named Alana, who appear to be strangely immune to the phenomenon.",N/A,N/A,CBC's Punchline,02-08-2016,http://www.cbc.ca/punchline/not-the-news/global-allen-supply-at-all-time-low,02-11-2016
1,‘80S INVENTOR FINALLY PUTS FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE “FAXOPHONE”,"TOBERMORY, ON—Inventor Bruce Yardley announced this morning that his masterpiece, the “faxophone” – a product he’s been tinkering with since November of 1988 – is finally ready to grace the marketplace.

Yardley says his device will allow users to send and receive faxes while standing over a sewer grate in a pleather vest and fedora and ripping a “totally bitchin’ sax solo” in the rain.

“I never meant for it to take this long,” Yardley sighs as he adjusts the two glow-in-the-dark scrunchies that hold his mullet back from his face. “The faxophone was pretty much ready to go in 2006, but then I ran into a huge setback: the very real issue of soggy paper. So the last decade has been about figuring out how to sheath each fax in a protective waterproof coating.”

Yardley also says he often got distracted from his work because Knight Rider, his ferret, suffers from debilitating anxiety and requires constant care and reassurance.

Despite the delays, Yardley is optimistic that his invention will be flying off the shelves in the weeks to come.

“It’s just so endlessly gnarly that the public will be able to enjoy making today’s hottest music with the added convenience of today’s cutting edge communication technology,” Yardley explains excitedly from his remote cabin in Northern Ontario where his only connection to the outside world is a shortwave radio that picks up five different French opera stations – and poorly.

Yardley is also the mastermind behind several other patented products including the “Miami Vice-cube tray,” “Whoa-veralls!” and a scented hairspray known as “Perm-fume.”",N/A,N/A,CBC's Punchline,01-29-2016,http://www.cbc.ca/punchline/not-the-news/80s-inventor-finally-puts-finishing-touches-on-the-faxophone,02-11-2016
1,SOCIETY LOSES LONG BATTLE WITH TIRESOME CANCER CLICHÉS,"WINNIPEG, MB—Late Thursday afternoon, society lost its decades-long battle against irritating and unhelpful language used to describe cancer patients. Society quietly succumbed to the fight at 5:48 pm, Eastern Standard Time.

""Society was so brave. It fought long and hard,"" notable linguist Loren Noble explains tearfully. ""But ultimately, society came to the decision that every time it spoke or wrote about a cancer patient it would be sure to blame the sick person for dying, and characterize him or her as somehow weak-willed. As time wore on, society simply became unable to conceive of cancer in any other terms.""

Society is described by many as larger-than-life, an entity that loved ice cream and inexplicably describing every imaginable problem as a war. Friends and family smile as they recall “the war on drugs”; “the war on terror”; “the war on Christmas”; and most offensive of all, “the war on cancer.” But society had a softer side, too: those intimately acquainted with it describe its persistent terror at simply stating the word “death” in plain and unadorned English.

Society hung on for many years but tragically, the hoards of tiresome cancer clichés proved too formidable an opponent.

1,QUICK ‘N EASY MOM HACKS!,"Life with a little one can be chaos, and danger lurks around every corner, organic blanket, and hypoallergenic plush goat. Use these easy tips and tricks to keep your child out of harm’s way!

PROBLEM: Your child’s zipper pull feels a bit cool to the touch
Research shows that a child experiences long-term psychosocial damage when his fingers make contact with a somewhat cool zipper pull.

QUICK ‘N EASY MOM HACK: Wake up two hours before dawn. Drive 20 minutes to your storage locker on the other side of town. Dig through your mountain of possessions until you find a pair of long nose pliers. Drive home. Spend 40 minutes struggling to remove your child’s zipper pull from his coat. Place the zipper pull on a cookie tray and pre-heat oven to 250. Place cookie tray in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Reattach zipper pull to coat. By the time your child wakes up, eats breakfast, and is ready to head out the door, the zipper pull will have cooled to a kind of warmish temperature! Amazing!

PROBLEM: Your child doesn’t like bread crusts
Children should never be made to eat, see, think about, or know about foods that don’t personally appeal to them. “In terms of elevating their stress levels, it’s the equivalent of six divorces,” explains child psychologist Barbarbara Whipp.

QUICK ‘N EASY MOM HACK: Begin by writing to the Canadian Wheat Board with the eventual goal of changing the legislation around how bread is processed and produced in Canada. Arrange a three-year absence from your job so that you’re physically and mentally available to attend to this cause full-time. This goes without saying, but make sure you enroll in a graduate program for Agricultural Science so you have the knowledge you’re going to need. Trent has a good one, as does University of Manitoba. Wow!

PROBLEM: Your child softly whines for 12 seconds when it’s time to get out of the bath
If your child is having a good time in the bath and you experience any resistance whatsoever when you gently suggest it’s time to get out, do not touch that child. “My mom did that to me once when I was three, and I hated it,” explains adult male Jacob McLean, 28. “Like, I seriously think I experienced a few seconds of mild inconvenience. What kind of tyrannical, power-hungry parenting is that? I haven’t spoken to her since.”

QUICK ‘N EASY MOM HACK: Fill a recycling bin or Rubbermaid storage container with warm, soapy water and voila – you can transfer your child to a portable bath tub and get on with your day. Once he’s in the portable tub, you can take him anywhere – the grocery store, preschool, Mandarin lessons, even his life coaching sessions – while he happily plays in the bath until he’s emotionally ready to emerge.

It’s not a great idea to drive with the portable bath in your car because water will get all over the seats – plus, most conventional seatbelts sadly still don’t accommodate every child’s life choices. Make sure you carry the portable bath in your arms at all times. Also, don’t even think about leaving home without an extra gallon of hot water strapped to your back – nothing’s worse than a bath that’s gone cold!",N/A,N/A,CBC's Punchline,02-09-2016,http://www.cbc.ca/punchline/miscellany/quick-n-easy-mom-hacks,02-11-2016
1,"LOCAL GROOMSMEN CONSIDER WEDDING POSES, OPT FOR ‘HOLDING OWN HAND’","OAKVILLE, ON—Despite a complete lack of premeditation, a group of local groomsmen decided the best thing to do during a recent wedding ceremony would be to drape their arms across the front of their bodies and hold their own hand.

“Nobody really talked about it,” says Grant Wiseman, who served as the Best Man. “It didn’t even come up at the rehearsal. But I guess when the moment arrived, we all knew what to do.”

All five groomsmen wordlessly assumed the pose shortly after the start of a wedding service in Oakville. Wedding attendees say the synchronization looked “effortless.”

“Honestly, they were free to do whatever they wanted,” says bride Laura Murdock. “We didn’t give them any specific direction. Personally, I thought it was great they wound up looking so coordinated.”

While the five men were almost perfectly in sync, one groomsmen, Blake Furlong, was responsible for the only discrepancy.

“Yeah, I guess all the other guys went left-hand-holding-right-hand, while I went right-holding-left,” says Furlong. “Things got tense when we saw the photos; some of the guys were pretty sour. Honestly, I thought we did pretty well considering it was improvised.”

In addition to the coordinated pose, all of the groomsmen chose an identical facial expression, adding to the sense of simpatico.

“We basically nailed it, from a facial perspective,” says Wiseman. “Again, fluky, but we all went with, ‘closed-mouth approving smile, twinkle eyes.’ Pretty fortunate.”

Emboldened by their success, the groomsmen are considering starting a wedding pose consulting business for other prospective parties.

“Look, we got lucky – things worked out for us.  But I can only imagine that for most weddings, it’s chaos,” says Furlong. “I assume groomsmen arms are everywhere – in pockets, waving to their friends, scratching themselves… you can’t leave this kind of thing to chance.”",N/A,N/A,CBC's Punchline,02-08-2016,http://www.cbc.ca/punchline/not-the-news/local-groomsmen-consider-wedding-poses-opt-for-holding-own-hand,02-11-2016
1,Ted Cruz Speech Cures Iowa Man’s Erectile Dysfunction,"DES MOINES — A 38-year-old Iowa man says he was excitedly jumping up and down cheering Ted Cruz at a rally today when he was “overwhelmed by a sudden, surging gush of love” that has restored his lost manlihood.

And Dale Scofield says it was a miracle that has earned Cruz his vote.

“Ted was praying hard for America — praying for us to smite our enemies, praying for us to be naked before the Lord — and then, wham, it happened,” Scofield told CNN following the event.Cruz-Sermon-Correctly-Sized“A beautiful miracle occurred for me right then and there on the concrete floor of the convention hall, and I knew Ted Cruz was my man,” said a still flushed Scofield.

“It’s been hard…well, actually it hasn’t been ha ha…it’s been hard suffering from this but today a man cured me. And that man is the next President of the United States, Ted Cruz.”

Scofield, a dog groomer and weekend Uber driver, says he has suffered from “dead-as-a-doornail erectile dysfunction” for more than 5 years and that he attended the Cruz rally after a friend told him that his lifelong stuttering had stopped after yelling at back-to-back-to-back Ted Cruz TV ads.Faithhealers“I’m not an overly religious guy but — whoa— if Ted Cruz can get my lap zap back, what can’t he do?” said Scofield.

“Can he cure my male pattern baldness? Can he get rid of my irritable bowels? Can he create more jobs? Calm the blacks down?”

“I wasn’t even thinking about my…you know…my guy down there, but when Ted started to pray it was like he must have known I was troubled. Thank you Ted Cruz. Thank you Jesus.”

The New York Times reported earlier this week that there have been 17 claims of miracles during the GOP nomination race with 8 of those attributed to Ted Cruz, 6 to Marco Rubio, and 3 to Donald Trump.  One miracle claim was exposed as fraudulent after a Muslim admitted he had been paid $500 to say he attended a Trump rally and wasn’t thrown out.

“In America, it’s like we don’t want to talk about miracles,” said Scofield.

“Or erectile dysfunction.”

1,Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses Brawl Trying to Get to Refugees First,"MONTREAL — An unbrotherly brawl broke out at Pierre Elliot Trudeau Airport this afternoon as two religious groups punched, elbowed, and hair-pulled each other trying to get a minute of a refugee family’s time.

And the new Canadian family was startled and confused.

“I saw one woman pull a man to the ground by his nostrils,” the family’s 31-year-old mother of two told the Gazette.

“And two young men were beating another man on the head with their books,” said the wide-eyed woman.

“At first we thought all the shoving and wrestling on the floor was some form of welcome we are not familiar with. We thought we should clap to show our thanks.”

“But some people had bleeding noses and one woman was swinging a cane and hitting everyone in the legs.”

“I did not read this about Canadians in any of the information.”

Montreal Police Service (Service de police de la Ville de Montréal) officers told the Gazette that 7 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Paramedics said that one man had a handful of teeth knocked out by a flung copy of The Book of Mormon and a woman was treated for dizziness after being struck on the head by a briefcase full of Watchtower magazines.

“It appears that a group of young Mormon missionaries sprinted up to the international arrivals gate and found that a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses had already claimed the best spots for converting refugees…sorry, the best greeting areas,” said Staff Sergeant Sanju Singh.

“Words were exchanged followed by some shoving and jostling before all hell…several fights broke out.”

The young refugee family reportedly shielded their children’s ears from “rude swear words” shouted by both groups before the father, mother, and two daughters were whisked away from the fighting by volunteers.

Singh said charges are pending against four Mormons and two Jehovah’s Witnesses, including one found in possession of marijuana.

“I’ve never seen church people duke it out before,” bystander Guy Nault told CTV.

“I’d a bet on all those young Mormon guys but man they got their wholesome butts handed to them by those old Jehovahs. Hilarious.”

1,Boring Trial Gets Juicy as Duffy Has “Blubbering Meltdown” on Stand,"OTTAWA — The fraud trial of P.E.I. Senator Mike Duffy was forced to adjourn today after Duffy was unable to control his weeping over Stephen Harper ‘sucking him in and playing him like a cheap ukulele’.

“Stephen said he would protect me —he, he, he said he would p…p…protect me,” Duffy began repeating over and over on the stand before Justice Charles Vaillancourt ordered a stoppage and called for paramedics.Mike-Duffy-Greg-Banning-Court-Sketch-SizedCourtroom artist’s sketch by illustrator Greg Banning

The proceedings were halted at shortly after ten a.m. and it was more than an hour before Senator Duffy (69) emerged from the OPS ambulance and spoke briefly to reporters before being whisked away by his lawyer Donald Bayne.

But CTV reported that Duffy was still a “mumbling mess”.

“Stephen said I could spend as much as I wanted,” Duffy said to the media scrum in a warbling voice similar to the one he was using when court was adjourned earlier.

“He said I could fly business class and have massages — he said he was my friend, that he really, really liked me.”Duffy is testifying in his own defence against 31 criminal offences including fraud, breach of trust and bribery. His defence strategy to those charges is largely based on claims that Senate expense rules are “loosey-goosey”, that he considered his outdoor-plumbed cottage in P.E.I his home, and that former Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a “lying nut-sucker”.

”Senator Duffy is an honest man guilty of nothing more than wanting to serve his country — and suffering from a case of unrequited man-love for Stephen Harper,” Bayne told CTV as he helped Duffy into a waiting car.Mike-Duffy-Face-Exit-Door-Sized“Bluntly, Mr. Duffy was an innocent doormat. Sure, he loved the fine food and wine. Sure, he bought a new wardrobe. Sure, he had a make-up artist with him 7 days a week. But he was never told to stop.”

“I ask you — who among us hasn’t been blinded by admiration for a leader?”

“What man has never had a bit of a guy-crush at some point in his life and done everything he’s told to do?”

“That’s not a crime. That’s endearingly human.”

Dubbed by National Post columnist Andrew Coyne as “the trial nobody gives a piddle about now that Harper’s gone”, proceedings in the case are now scheduled to resume whenever Senator Duffy “gets over his self-pity party” according to a source in Justice Vaillancourt’s office.",N/A,N/A,Lapine,12-10-2015,http://thelapine.ca/boring-trial-gets-juicy-as-duffy-has-blubbering-meltdown-on-stand/,02-11-2016
1,MPs Get into Ugly Food Fight Just Hours After Trudeau’s “Sunny Ways” Throne Speech,"OTTAWA — Police say charges are likely after Conservative, NDP, and Liberal MPs went for a few friendly drinks last night following the Throne Speech but ended up arguing, shoving, and hurling chicken wings and Shepherd’s pie at each other.

“I can confirm that 32 Members of Parliament were involved in a series of aggressive food-related incidents late yesterday at D’Arcy McGee’s Pub near Parliament Hill,” Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau told CTV today.

“We are reviewing security tapes but it appears that several Liberals took offence after a Conservative MP snuck up behind Prime Minister Trudeau and carefully and quietly “crowned” his hair with several calamari rings dripping with ranch dressing.”

“Two Liberal MPs responded by pelting the Conservative member with their vegetable curries — things escalated quickly from there.”

“Seven Members of Parliament were treated at the scene for minor injuries and one New Democrat was transported to hospital to have several coconut shrimp removed from his nasal cavity,” said Bordeleau, unable to suppress a grin.

“Alcohol is believed to have been involved.”

The restaurant confrontation between members of the three parties is in sharp contrast to the upbeat mood in the House earlier in the day when Justin Trudeau continued his push for “sunny ways” in government with the Liberals presenting their first Speech from the Throne that, among other things, asked all MPs to stop being “arrogant blow-hards” and to show a new respect for other members of Parliament.

That brief session of Parliament ended with a group hug that Conservatives declined to take part in.

That was wild!” said Rory Tanner, Manager of D’Arcy McGee’s.Jason-Kenney-disgruntled“One minute all these MPs were hugging and being nicey nice and the next minute they were hurling meatloaf sandwiches at each other. When I saw that young Pierre Poilievre guy pinning down Thomas Mulcair and smearing beet hummus into his beard, I knew it was time to dial 911 — our beet hummus is terrific by the way.”

And things got physical when Saunders refused the barked orders to halt and identify himself.

But it wasn’t the retired teacher who ended up on the ground.

“Well heck, one second he was warming his hands by this kind of puny little fire and the next second he was running at me and shouting to get down on the ground,” Saunders told reporters gathered near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

“Made me mad really. It’s public property and here this guy is acting all big and tough and pushy.”

“I don’t swear much at all but I told him to screw right off and that made him really angry. He started yelling right into my face — his breath was…well, pee you…it smelled like beer and maybe salami sausages or something.”Oregon-Militia-Go-Home-Bundys-Sized“So I said there was no darn way I was getting down on the ground and he poked me in the shoulder — so, yeah, I did a leg take-down. Didn’t know I even remembered that old move. Did it without even thinking about it. Haha.”

“He landed pretty hard on his back and I could tell he was winded because he started moaning and trying to suck air into his lungs. And that was that.”

An FBI spokesperson at the entrance to the refuge told reporters that this is the first reported instance of any conflict between the occupying militant group and locals but warned that things could escalate quickly as other armed militants continue to arrive by the truckload.

“We’re hoping this is an isolated incident and we’re asking the elderly not to knock any more militants on their ass,” said the grinning FBI agent.

Harney County Sheriff David Ward appealed for calm among local citizens and the nearly 400 bird watchers who have come to the area promising to drive the militants out of the refuge that is home to dozens of species of birds including owls, white pelicans, sandhill cranes, and yellow-bellied black birds.

“I hope I didn’t hurt the man…well, his pride maybe,” said Saunders from his small bungalow in the nearby town of Burns, population 2,700.

“When I left to go check on the owls, he was still curled up in a ball on the ground.”

1,Optimistic conspiracy theorists believe that 9/11 was an accident,"CALGARY (The News Desk) — A group of self-described “9/11 oopsers” met last Saturday at a sunny café in Calgary to discuss what they call “the biggest misunderstanding ever accidentally perpetuated by a well-intentioned but ultimately mistaken government since Vietnam.”

The group is seeking to shed light on the events leading up to 9/11 that, they say, prove the whole thing was a “giant mix-up.”

“We are the victims of a massive conspiracy that aims to ascribe human agency to an event that happened completely by accident,” said the group’s founder, Florence Bacha. “No more lies. 9/11 was nobody’s fault.”

The first piece of evidence Bacha showed the Syrup Trap was a slow-motion video of the second airplane to hit the Twin Towers.

“That’s it! Right there,” she said, pointing to a wobble in the plane’s wing. “Before the second plane goes into the north tower, you can clearly see it trying to maneuver out of the way.”

Next she unveiled a map showing that the planes’ flight plans may well have intended for them to fly through where the towers were standing, by some tragic cartographical error.

“Life is without trajectory or reason,” she said, and the gathered oopsers nodded in agreement. “Any attempt to project meaning onto events is futile.”

The continuing popular belief that the plane crashes were deliberate grates at Bacha, she said, considering the existence of so much evidence to the contrary.

“Wake up, sheeple!” she shouted, to nobody in particular. “No one would do such a terrible thing on purpose.” ",N/A,N/A,Syrup Trap,02-10-2016,http://syruptrap.ca/2016/02/optimistic-conspiracy-theorist-believes-that-911-was-an-accident/,02-11-2016
1,Neil Young’s 2011 Juno Awards still rolling around on the floor of his car,"REDWOOD CITY (The News Desk) — Nearly five years after accepting three Juno Awards at a ceremony in Toronto, rock legend Neil Young has reportedly yet to remove the trophies from his car.

“It’s a great honour … I appreciate it,” Young had said at the 2011 event, where, among other accolades, he claimed Artist of the Year. An assembled crowd at Toronto’s Allstream Centre then delivered a standing ovation for the Winnipeg-born singer-songwriter.

The three trophies, made of laser-engraved crystal, remain on the front passenger-side floor of a 2003 Ford F-150 Ranger with crew cab that Young uses for chores on his Redwood City, CA ranch.

The mud-streaked awards share the floor with a broken tape measure, a discarded 2012 copy of the Palo Alto Weekly and a receipt for a bottle of Diet Sprite that Young purchased at a nearby Chevron in February 2013.

Sources say that Young originally placed the trophies on the passenger seat of the truck, intending to take them to a workshop on the property. However, he became distracted and the statuettes soon migrated to the floor.

In the years since, the former Buffalo Springfield member has made several concerted attempts to remember to bring the awards inside, including an incident when girlfriend Darryl Hannah opened the truck’s passenger side door only to see the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award, along with several other trophies, tumble to the pavement.

“These are still here. What are these?” she said, according to witnesses.

“Yeah, yeah, I’ll move them,” Young is said to have replied.

The 2011 Junos also saw Montreal-based indie rock band Arcade Fire nab the award for Alternative Album of the Year for The Suburbs. As of press time, sources say lead singer Win Butler was using the trophy’s hardwood base to drive in a stubborn nail on a carpet transition strip.",N/A,N/A,Syrup Trap,02-09-2016,http://syruptrap.ca/2016/02/neil-youngs-2011-juno-awards-still-rolling-around-the-floor-of-his-car/,02-11-2016
1,Make-A-Wish CEO can’t believe no one has wished for a cure yet,"PHOENIX (The News Desk) — Lamenting how a simple lack of imagination has resulted in the deaths of thousands of children, CEO of the Make-A-Wish Foundation David Klotz-Ritter said Thursday that he could not fathom why no child in the program has ever wished for a cure yet.

“You see these kids every day with these horrible, life-threatening conditions. We go to their house or hospital bed and ask them, ‘If you could have anything in the whole world, what would it be?’ And it’s always to meet a hockey player or something,” said Klotz-Ritter.

“I’m just stunned that they would waste a chance to cure their disease like that.”

Klotz-Ritter, who is an ancient and powerful genie and possesses the raw magical energy required to cure any individual of any disease, says he started the foundation as a way to distribute the gift of life to the dying. He set up a simple rule, in line with his celestial limitations: whatever wish a dying child asks for, he will grant.

“It’s my fault, I suppose. I should’ve made it simpler. Or more clear? That you can wish for things that don’t exist yet? I don’t know,” he said, somberly shaking his head.

1,Toronto Maple Leafs defeated by the sport of hockey,"TORONTO (The News Desk) — Admitting that his team’s troubles were much deeper than he had previously suspected, Toronto Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock conceded that his team was defeated by the sport of hockey during Tuesday’s regular season game against the Florida Panthers.

“Tonight we were defeated by the very idea of hockey,” said Babcock, who lamented his team’s troubles with the most basic aspects of the sport.

Babcock cited line changes, passing, and the rule that the puck must enter the opponents’ net to count as a goal as elements of the sport that his team had the most trouble with on Tuesday.

He said that basic mistakes, like when captain Dion Phaneuf passed the puck to a Leafs fan in the balcony of the arena in the first period, were “inexcusable.”

He also had stern words for goalie Jonathan Bernier, who went went home midway through the second period to check his email and print out the itinerary for his next flight, allowing the Panthers to score 17 unanswered goals.

“This isn’t completely the players’ fault. I forgot some pretty basic aspects of the game myself at numerous points,” said Babcock.

“We just can’t afford to make mistakes like this. Not in a league that is this fiercely competitive.”

In an effort to rebuild the team’s ability to play basic hockey, the Leafs plan to practice putting on their equipment, skating and listening at their next practice.",N/A,N/A,Syrup Trap,01-26-2016,http://syruptrap.ca/2016/01/toronto-maple-leafs-defeated-by-the-sport-of-hockey/,02-11-2016
1,Ferris Bueller’s Night In,"I made it.

Crazy. One of my lamest attempts to leave the office early during my tenure as marketing specialist at DFJ Engineering, and not one person asked me where I was headed so soon.

How could I possibly go for after-work drinks with my cubicle-mates on a night like this? I have leftover chili and a growler of Green Flash in the fridge, and a brand-new pair of super-cozy terrycloth sweatpants waiting on my dresser at home.

This is the fourth Friday in a row I’ve skipped out on happy hour. I’m running out of excuses. Last week I said I had to give my cat some important cat medicine. The time before that I said I needed to take her to the vet for a teeth cleaning. If I flake out again, I might have to actually get a cat.

So I better make tonight count by doing absolutely nothing.

The key to brushing off your coworkers is to build your alibi early in the week. On Wednesday, let it slip that your cousin might be coming to town on the weekend. At lunch on Thursday, mention that you have to pick her up at the airport on Friday because she can’t figure out public transit.

A lot of people will tell you that the best approach is simply to be honest and say you want to hang out with your wife at home tonight eating leftovers and binge-watching TV in your new sweatpants, but if you get an annoying co-worker who says you can do that any night of the week, and he won’t take no for an answer, you might end up at a bowling alley until 8 p.m., and that’s worse than work.

Here’s what you do. When you arrive at the office on Friday morning, remind people that you have to pick up your cousin in the evening. Then, at 4:15, get up from your computer as if you’re going to the restroom. But instead, head to the back storage nook by the testing lab, grab your messenger bag and coat — which you stashed there earlier — and slip out the west fire exit. If anyone asks where you’re headed, just yell, “Coffee run!” and keep walking.

Then head up Georgia Street and catch the SkyTrain to City Hall Station, where you take a bus to your condo. It’s comical and a little melodramatic when you think about it, but then, so is season three of Orange is the New Black.

Weekends move pretty fast. If you don’t stop and do nothing for at least one of the evenings, you’ll blink and it’s Sunday afternoon, and you have that dreaded feeling that Monday is just around the corner, and you didn’t even have a single two-hour nap.

I do have a cousin coming to visit; that is happening IRL. But she is really good with public transit, and she’s staying with a friend of hers. They’re going to a party tonight with people my wife and I don’t know. My cousin’s an extrovert. I’m not an extrovert, I don’t plan on becoming an extrovert, so why would I go to a party with a bunch of people I’ve never met? They could be the sweetest, most board-gaming cinephiles in the Pacific Northwest, but it still wouldn’t change the fact that I prefer to drink my own martinis.

“I’m dancing on my own, I make the moves up as I go, and that’s what they don’t know, mmm hmmm, that’s what they don’t know—”

It’s not like I would label myself an introvert, or any “vert” for that matter. Labels, in my opinion, are not good. A person cannot choose how outgoing he is, but he can choose what type of gin he uses.

I quote Geddy Lee: “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”

Good point there. After all, he’s in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I could have chosen to go out for drinks with my co-workers tonight, and I probably would have had a decent time, but I made another choice. And it involves terrycloth.",N/A,N/A,Syrup Trap,01-21-2016,http://syruptrap.ca/2016/01/ferris-buellers-night-in/,02-11-2016
1,Trudeau Awards Ted Cruz With Order of Canada,"Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has announced American GOP presidential nominee Ted Cruz is the 2015 recipient of The Order of Canada. The award recognizes Cruz's contribution to Canadian society.

The 2014 Order of Canada went to world-renown recycling guru, Red Green, who is currently using the accompanying keepsake Inuit carving as a fourth couch leg.

""We are very pleased to make this momentous announcement,"" said Trudeau at the press conference at Rideau Hall. ""It is a shame that Mr. Cruz couldn't join us for this announcement but he is busy trying to become the first Calgarian to win the White House.""

When asked to respond to the award announcement, Cruz claimed the newbie world leader had likely mistaken him for Ted Simonett, the actor who plays the weird guy on Canadian Tire commercials.

""They got the wrong guy,"" fumed Cruz. ""I want to bomb Canada for their oil and fresh water. That's my contribution to those wacky pack of frozen socialists and walrus herders.""

During Cruz's Order of Canada induction, Trudeau talked about Cruz's many achievements. These included his education at Princeton and Harvard, as well becoming a senator for the state of Texas.

""But the greatest contribution Cruz made to Canadian society,"" Trudeau summed up, ""was when he left Canada for the U.S. For that one, single, selfless act, Canada is deeply indebted.""",N/A,N/A,Sage News,01-16-2016,http://www.sagenews.com/Article.asp?id=4066&title=Trudeau-Awards-Ted-Cruz-With-Order-of-Canada-,02-11-2016
1,Study of Dog Butt Licking Leads to Medical Break-through,"cle break-through in understanding Gastrointestinal Infections. “We observed a group of 100 dogs and their ass licking behaviors and asked the question, ""What benefit is there to butt licking?” advised Professor Alhimar Alllaeiq, head of the school bacteriological lavoratories.

The study, conducted over a six month period, resulted in cataloging twelve new strains of bacteria, and to a new protocol for the prevention of infectious diseases. Swansea, a progressive think tank, is known for its innovative liberal technics in gathering scientific data.

“We noticed that some dogs butt-lick more than others,” explained Alllaeiq, “and that there are those dogs suffering from more G.I. infections than those that didn't partake.”

Alllaeiq told The Sage that the data was conflicting at times; it depended on if the dogs gave, received, or self indulged.

“We needed to expand our study parameters; so in January we moved onto human testing.” Alllaeiq stated .""Over 300 students volunteered to take part in the study.""

“The results provided that 'Eureka' moment,” advised Alllaeiq. “Our study has proven that butt-licking can cause serious health problems in humans and should be avoided at all costs.”",N/A,N/A,Sage News,02-08-2016,http://www.sagenews.com/Article.asp?id=4073&title=Study-of-Dog-Butt-Licking-Leads-to-Medical-Break-through,02-11-2016

1,Star Wars Would Be Different If ItsTechnology Was Like Ours,"The most mystical aspect of the Star Wars galaxy isn't the concept of the Force, the metaphysical power that connects the galaxy.

It's the technology.

What makes Star Wars’ technology so cool is that it actually works and is fairly intuitive. After all, Luke is able to fix his lightsaber without contacting the Jedi Help Desk or making an appointment with a Jedi Genius.

But back on earth, the Force is not strong with our technology. The hype is often better than the reality, especially at the initial launch. Think I'm overstating it?  Here are 15 ways ""Star Wars"" would be different if the Rebel Alliance had to rely on our technology and tech savvy.

When Obi-Wan plays the message Princess Leia had recorded on R2-D2, not even the Force could prevent the hologram from buffering.
To get a ride to another planet, you wouldn't go to some dive bar to find a willing pilot; just click SpaceLyft.  Finding a place to stay would be easy, thanks to Spacebnb. 
The Clone Army would be comprised of PC clones from dimly-remembered, vaguely warlike brands like Commodore, Apollo and Data General.
R2-D2 and C-3PO would glitch out at key moments, with Luke constantly having to reboot them – and wait 30 minutes before they’re fully operational.
To keep R2-D2, C-3PO and his lightsaber powered up, Luke would carry different chargers and cables for each, making his carry-on bag his most important accessory.
Lightsabers would have 55 minutes of fight time, 24 hours of wait time.
No matter what he had been through with them, Luke would trade in the 30-year-old R2-D2 and C-3PO to get next-generation droids, the ones with better cameras and cooler apps.
Han must reset his password to the Millennium Falcon either every 30 days or whenever someone says, ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" – whichever comes first. 
The Millennium Falcon’s Navi-Computer might get them to their destination but not always via the quickest, most direct route. And vocal commands to its onboard computer would be misunderstood. Constantly. 
The Millennium Falcon and all podracers come equipped with plenty of cup holders plus back-up cameras to make parking easier.
Instead of risking squadrons of X-Wing fighters in an attack on the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance could just send a virus to attack the B2E (Business-to-Empire) software running the thermal exhaust port. Or it might just crash on its own.
After being awarded medals by Princess Leia for (spoiler alert) destroying the First Death Star, Generals Solo and Skywalker would snap a selfie and post it on Tweet Tweet (named after the sound R2-D2 makes).
Instead of the love interest triangle of Leia, Han, and Luke, Luke would join J-Date-Jedi-Date (""Use The Force To Get Chosen"").
Everyone in the Empire would know Darth Vader is Luke's dad after he liked him on Spacebook.
No one would look up from their screens. Ever. When told that Han and Leia finally have disabled the force field that protected the Second Death Star, the awaiting rebel pirates, busy playing Candy Crush, would ask for ""another five minutes to finish this round.""
Of all Star Wars' superior technology, the most important breakthrough for us to develop is not what you might think.  It's not hover cars (since they're not driverless) and it's not droids that handle a range of tasks (my kids would love one that picks up after them). It's on-the-go wireless recharging. After all, whether you're a rebel fighting the evil Galactic Empire or parents raising a couple of kids - who has the time to wait a couple of hours for your devices to power up?",N/A,N/A,Sage News,12-18-2015,http://www.sagenews.com/Article.asp?id=4052&title=Star-Wars-Would-Be-Different-If-ItsTechnology-Was-Like-Ours,02-11-2016
1,Scientists Reveal: Deaths Linked to Thoughts of Death,"A recent study released from the American Sphenopalatine Ganglioneuralgia Foundation (ASGF) discovered that there is a direct correlation between thoughts of death and death itself. According to the Director of ASGF, Dr. Diur N. L. Enuresis, polls conducted with 100 men and woman after their deaths, show that 95 of the deceased had thoughts of death within one week of their passing.

“It did not matter how they died,” stated Dr. Enuresis, “the fact remains that each one of the 95 decedents where thinking of death.” The study concludes that thinking of death, is directly linked to a persons accelerated demise.

“It is quite simple,” advised Dr. Enuresis, “keep happy, think good thoughts and you may live longer.”

The study has come under some criticism from some medical professionals, citing issues with how the data was derived. The ASGF has been accused of using crystal balls, Ouija Boards, or Seers that devined the data; but the Foundation remains firm. “We did not use any ethereal or fringe technics, all our information came directly from a questionnaire completed by each decedent,"" responded Dr. Enuresis.

In defense of the ASGF, the United Nations World Health Organization is standing firm with the study. “We can find no fault in ASGF's data gathering methods,” stated WHO's Dr. Woo.

Minutes after the returns started coming in, revealing that Fiorina had no chance of making a respectable showing, the former business executive acknowledged that she was “sad at first—but then I realized that every failure is an opportunity, and in this case I had an opportunity to give some people the axe.”

After delivering pink slips to her entire campaign staff, Fiorina said, “I started feeling better already.”

“That’s the one thing you have to understand about Carly Fiorina—she doesn’t stay down for long,” she said.

1,Christie Quits Race to Focus on Tormenting Rubio,"NEW HAMPSHIRE —In a stunning announcement on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said that he was dropping out of the Presidential race to focus his energies on tormenting Florida Senator Marco Rubio full-time.

“At the end of the day, running for President was interfering with what I really love, which is making Marco Rubio’s life a living hell,” he said. “Now I can get up every morning and spend all day just doing that.”

Christie said that he had tired of fielding questions about ISIS, immigration, and the economy and having to find some contrived way of answering them with a scathing attack on Rubio. “Don’t get me wrong, I was great at it,” he said. “But it’ll be so much easier to just get out there and start tearing him apart with no pretext whatsoever.”

The New Jersey governor, who plans to bring his message of character assassination to all fifty states, did not indicate how he would finance this mission. “I’ll pay for it myself if I have to,” he said. “If, looking back on my life, I can say that I ground Marco Rubio into the dirt, I will die a happy man.”

Asked what his first stop would be after leaving the campaign trail, Christie said, “I want to reconnect with my family, hug my kids, and tell them what a douche Marco is.”",N/A,N/A,Borowitz Report,02-08-2016,http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/christie-quits-race-to-focus-on-tormenting-rubio,02-11-2016
1,Jeb Hopes to Woo Voters with Ad Featuring Worst President in U.S. History,"NEW HAMPSHIRE —The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is hoping to jump-start his lagging Presidential campaign with a new television ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history, campaign aides confirm.

With the crucial New Hampshire primary just hours away, the Bush campaign believes it can finish strong by reminding voters of Jeb’s connection to a man who left the nation in smoldering ruins.

In the ad, which Bush aides are calling “a fantastic closing argument,” Jeb’s ability to keep the United States safe and create peace around the world is praised by the President, whose decisions helped destabilize the Middle East and give rise to ISIS.

Across the state, the ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history is making a powerful impression on voters. “It brought back a lot of memories,” Carol Foyler, who lost her house in 2007, said.

With the ad scheduled to air around the clock until primary day, aides to Bush are hoping that the commercial, persuasive as it is, is not too little, too late. “We’re kicking ourselves that we didn’t air this sooner,” one Bush aide said. “An endorsement from [the person who presided over the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression] confers instant credibility.”",N/A,N/A,Borowitz Report,02-08-2016,http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/jeb-hopes-to-woo-voters-with-ad-featuring-worst-president-in-u-s-history,02-11-2016
1,Sanders Admits Receiving Free Checking from Big Banks,"MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE —Scandal rocked Bernie Sanders’s Presidential campaign on Friday as the candidate was forced to admit that he received free checking from several big banks.

In a press conference in Manchester, New Hampshire, a chastened Sanders acknowledged that, over the past two decades, he received free checking from Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase in exchange for maintaining a five-hundred-dollar minimum balance.

“I should have acknowledged my relationship with these banks earlier,” a subdued Sanders told reporters. “For that, I am sorry.”

The Clinton campaign immediately seized on the revelation, with one senior Clinton aide alleging that Sanders’s cozy relationship with the banks “effectively strips him of the label ‘progressive.’ ”

“Quite frankly, I don’t know of too many progressives who make five-hundred-dollar payoffs to the big banks,” the aide said. “This doesn’t pass the smell test.”

1,Shkreli Miraculously Makes Nation Side with Congress,"WASHINGTON —In a feat that some observers called nothing short of miraculous, the embattled pharmaceuticals C.E.O. Martin Shkreli single-handedly made the American people side with Congress on Thursday morning.

According to polls taken after his appearance before the despised legislative body, Shkreli’s smug, smirking, and utterly douchey performance had the effect of temporarily transforming members of Congress into marginally sympathetic figures.

The University of Minnesota’s Opinion Research Institute, which tracks the American people’s attitudes toward the legislative branch, said that after Shkreli’s appearance Congress’s approval rating surged from eleven per cent to fourteen per cent.

“A three-per-cent gain may not seem like a lot, but I think everyone in Congress is popping champagne corks today,” Davis Logsdon, the pollster who supervised the survey, said. “Martin Shkreli is the best thing to happen to Congress in years.”

1,"Sarah Palin Licks Frozen Flagpole in Iowa, Gets Stuck","Sarah Palin has reportedly been stuck for several hours after licking a frozen flagpole outside a rally in Des Moines, Iowa this morning.

According to witnesses on the scene, the former Alaska governor traced the pole with her tongue “to see what would happen”. Her tongue quickly froze to the metal, and has been cemented ever since.

Several attempts to free Palin using hot coffee and tea have failed. Emergency crews have arrived on the scene and are currently strategizing the best course of action to liberate her tongue without causing permanent damage.  

“Every once in awhile we come across a toddler who does something similar,” says one local first responder. ”But in my 35 years as an EMT,  I’ve never seen this happen to an adult.”

Palin was reportedly shaking hands and signing autographs after the rally when she became entranced by the shininess of the pole. Unable to pull herself away, she proceeded to lick the pole to see what made it shine.

Users on social media have been sharing photographs of the ordeal with #palinpop and #brainfreeze.

Although Palin is not widely known for her intelligence, her newfound depth of stupidiy has shocked even her own political supporters.

“I know Sarah Palin isn’t the brightest politician in the world,” says one Iowa Republican attending the rally. “But you would think that being from Alaska she would at least understand the concept of metal being cold.”

For obvious reasons Palin herself has been hitherto unable to comment on her ordeal. However, in a recent Facebook post her daughter Bristol Palin blamed ""Obama not supporting the troops"" for the incident.

1,BET Acquires The Daily Currant for $300,"Just one day after Spanish-language television network acquired a controlling stake in The Onion for $200 million, another satirical website mega-deal has been announced.

Following weeks of hard-fought negotiations, Black Entertainment Television (BET) has reportedly agreed to purchase a 70% stake in The Daily Currant for $300.

""BET is thrilled to be investing in this red-hot digital entertainment property,"" the network said in a statement.""We strongly believe the future of digital media lies in this infrequently updated WordPress blog with no full-time employees.

""It seems obvious to our leadership that adding The Daily Currant's occasional ability to distribute viral articles on social media to our own stable of shitty original television programming should - somehow - create the media empire of the future.""

1,Man Awoken From 27-Year Coma Commits Suicide After Learning Donald Trump Leads Presidential Race,"A man who miraculously woke up from a 27-year coma last week has committed suicide after learning that real estate billionaire Donald Trump leads the 2016 presidential race.

Nicholas Vedder, 56, had been in a coma since 1988 following an automobile accident in his hometown of Albany, NY. 

An engineer by training, Vedder spontaneously awoke last Tuesday. Doctors say he had been optimistic about resuming his career and reintegrating into society - - until a chance encounter with a visitor changed his perspective.

""I thought it'd be cool to show him my iPhone,"" says Dustin Douglas, a childhood friend. ""So then he started playing around with the CNN app and saw a story about Donald Trump running for president.""

""He asked me if it was a joke, and I told him it wasn't. Trump is actually leading the polls for president. Two hours later we found his body hanging from the ceiling.""

Vedder left a note beside his bed explaining his motivations.

""Although I admire humanity's progress during my slumber,"" he wrote, ""I simply cannot live in a world where Donald Trump is a serious candidate for President of the United States.""

Administrators at VanWinkle Memorial Hospital claim that Vedder showed no signs of psychiatric distress prior to learning about Trump's presidential campaign. Nevertheless, they have promised a ""full and complete investigation"" into how the suicide occurred on their watch.

Funeral services are scheduled for Thursday at St. Boulchitte Church in Loudonville.

1,Trump Promises to Serve ‘Roasted Muslim’ at GOP Convention,"Donald Trump promised voters in Iowa this morning that if nominated he will serve the flesh of Muslims as appetizers during the Republican national convention.

In a speech at Northeastern Iowa State University, the real-estate mogul once again pushed the boundaries of political discourse with his outrageous plan - which he says will help combat terrorism.

""I'm going to randomly select 100 Muslims, roast them like pigs, and serve the roasted flesh on a toothpick,"" he told a packed audience of 9,500, to rapturous applause.

""Have you ever had fresh Muslim meat? It's delicious. Tastes like lamb. You can do the arms. You can do the legs. The thighs are tremendously tender. Tremendously tender.

""And ISIS would hate it. They would hate it. They would be so scared to enter this country. There would never be an attack on America again. And all the other Muslims would leave and go back to their countries.

""But you know we have a problem with political correctness in this country. As soon as you start talking about dicing up and eating particular religious groups - they accuse you of racism. Can you believe that? This is what we need to change people.""

Indeed, liberal news outlets such as The New York Times and BuzzFeed have reacted to Trump's daring plan with predictable accusations of ""xenophobia"" and ""21st century genocide"".

However, according to a poll taken after the speech, Trump's support has now jumped 15 percentage points amongst likely Republican voters in the Hawkeye State.

""When I first heard the idea, I thought it sounded a little strange,"" says Vince Ray, a die-hard Trump supporter from Des Moines."" But the more I think about it - why can't we eat Muslims?

1,Study: Climate Change May Melt Cher By 2020,"A new study released today shows that global climate change may melt American pop icon Cher within five years.

According to the analysis, published in the prestigious journal Nature, higher temperatures near Cher’s home in Southern California will likely melt materials used in her numerous plastic surgeries, turning her into what scientists describe as a “puddle”.

“If she goes outdoors for even five minutes, it could be the end,” says Boris Samuelson, the lead researcher on the study. “We’ve run the numbers. Those polymers were not built to withstand the kind of temperatures that are coming.

“And the fact that she works in Vegas makes it even worse. In summertime she may not be able to survive the walk between her limo and the hotel.”

Scientists have recently discovered that places like Saudi Arabia and Dubai may be uninhabitable by 2100 due to increased temperatures from human generated climate change.

But today’s study is the first to link increased temperatures to cosmetic surgery, which has become an increasingly popular option for wealthy women in developed nations. 

""An entire generation of celebrities and trophy wives are now in danger,"" explains Samuelson. ""Particularly those living in places like LA and Miami Beach.""

1,Forced Molting - DON'T Try This at Home! (Unless You're Desperate to Get Pregnant),"When 53-year-old Denise Hobson first heard about the standard animal agriculture practice of ""forced molting,"" by which female chickens are deprived of food and light for up to two weeks in order to artificially jolt their weary bodies into producing more eggs, she was at first appalled - and then inspired to try it herself, to boost her own chances of getting pregnant.
Denise, a single woman living in New York City, explained that she has been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant since the age of 49. As a perimenopausal woman, she was all too aware that her ovulation was becoming increasingly sporadic and that her body was producing fewer and fewer eggs. However, she figured that she would compensate for her decreased fertility simply by increasing the frequency of her unprotected sexual encounters.
Unfortunately, recounted Denise, that plan didn't work out so well. For one, she found that as she approached middle age, she had fewer and fewer opportunities for casual sex. And not only that, the casual encounters she did manage to have were less than satisfying.
""In other words,"" she summarized ruefully, ""casual sex has been increasingly hard to come by. In every sense.""
The maternally-called Denise initially turned to her ob-gyn for help in getting pregnant. He recommended expensive fertility treatments, in which eggs from younger, more fertile donors would be implanted into her uterus. However, Denise couldn't afford the pricey procedure.
Then, just when she thought that she might have to relinquish her four-year-long-dream of becoming a middle-aged mom, Denise learned about forced molting.
""When I first saw the conditions of those hens,"" she said, ""I couldn't believe it. They're frail, boney, bald - utterly pathetic! And it occurred to me that if forced molting works for them, why shouldn't it work for me, too? I'm in much better shape.""
And so, beginning six months ago, Denise embarked upon her own self-created program of forced - or in her case, voluntarily induced - molting, going weeks at a time without food or natural light in order to jolt her body into ovulating outside its normal cycle. She's found it highly encouraging that, just as molting hens lose their feathers, she has lost all her hair.
That being said, the forced molting process has not been a walk in the park, says Denise - not by any stretch of the imagination.
For one, she'd thought that she'd found the ideal forced molting site in her favorite dark, dingy, food-desert neighborhood dive-bar. Realizing, however, that ingesting copious amounts of cheap beer might not be improving her fertility (although it did seem to improve her chances of having casual sex), Denise has since abandoned her dive-bar molting ""shed"" in favor of her windowless Manhattan apartment - which, she says, bears a marked similarity to the cramped, light-deprived edifices that house egg-laying hens.
The big question, of course, is...is it working?
Denise thinks so. Although she is not yet pregnant, she is confident that it is only a matter of time before her self-prescribed combination of forced molting and casual sex results in pregnancy.
""I can feel the ovulation,"" she avows. ""Dozens and dozens of eggs, dropping down into my uterus by the day. Oops, there goes another one right now! Did you hear it?""
In fact, Denise believes that her ovulation has been so amped-up by the process of forced molting that she will actually have eggs left over after her pregnancy is complete - eggs which she hopes to sell to a fertility clinic for a hefty fee.
A tender smile appearing on her face, she remarks, ""Never too soon to start thinking about my kid's college fund, right?""
Clearly, this middle-aged Manhattan ""chick"" is already thinking like a mother hen...",N/A,N/A,Spoof,12-10-2015,http://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/125469/forced-molting-dont-try-this-at-home-unless-youre-desperate-to-get-pregnant,02-11-2016

1,Donald Trump: “I Was Caucus Blocked By Ted Cruz”,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Addressing a private group of supporters in Iowa, Donald Trump vowed that he would not give up his #1 frontrunner status easily, after being “Caucus blocked” by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Cruz eked out a narrow GOP victory during an Iowa Caucus race deemed “too close to call” during most of Monday evening.

“He was Caucus blocked, said a Trump campaign aide. “He told me so himself. Who knew Ted Cruz was a Caucus blocker? You know what I mean? We’ve all had it happen. You’re out one evening, having a good time, you meet someone, then all of a sudden somebody comes along, moves in … you know the rest. He was flat out Caucus blocked.”

With 99% of the vote in, Cruz won 28% of the delegate’s votes, followed by Trump with 24%, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 23%.

Trump also expressed anger and disappointment that Cruz’ tactic of sending voters a controversial direct mail, apparently worked to the Texas senator’s advantage. The mailer, misleadingly marked “Voting Violation” say critics, “graded” local citizen’s voting history, much like a school report card. Many on both sides of the political aisle called the mailers “shaming letters,” and a violation of voters’ rights.

“I think it’s one of the most horrible things I have seen in politics,” said Trump, adding, “and I have seen some pretty bad stuff.”

During a short public speech thanking his supporters, Trump predicted victory in New Hampshire, site of the first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 9. “I love the people of Iowa,” said Trump. “I may come back to Iowa and buy a farm,” he said, before exiting the podium.

Whether Trump does buy the farm in Iowa is anyone’s guess after this early electoral contest — sometimes an indicator of the eventual nominee, and sometimes not. Former Arkansas Gov.

1,"Papa John’s Pizza Tests Positive for HGH, Report Alleges","JEFFERSTOWN, Ky. – Papa John’s founder John Schnatter probably hoped spokesperson Peyton Manning’s HGH accusation troubles wouldn’t affect his pizza business, but increased scrutiny of Manning translates to added attention on Manning’s friends, business partners, and the products he endorses.

As a result, the Wyoming Institute of Technology conducted a scientific ingredient analysis of the popular pizza Manning promotes.

“Our tests revealed the presence of HGH in everything,” says WIT Prof. Olivia Fontaine. “We even found it in the cardboard box surrounding the pie.”

A Papa John’s spokesperson labeled the Institute’s findings “outrageous,” and “most likely the result of a liberal media conspiracy cooked up by a desperate pizza competitor on Schnatter’s enemies list.”

Sources say a group of Papa John’s long-time customers have now joined a class-action lawsuit naming Schnatter as defendant, with Joan de Havilland of Shreveport-Bossier City, La. named as lead plaintiff.

“I always say,” explained de Havilland, “all I need to do is look at a slice of pizza, and I gain 5 pounds. Come to find out, all I had to do was touch the box! Look at me now. My fingers got all swole up! I need justice!”

A statement attributed to Schnatter reads:

“It is unfortunate that a long-time customer experienced a totally unrelated medical issue that coincidentally makes her eligible for Obamacare, creating an unfair burden for job creators such as myself. I can say with 100% confidence, however, that after eating my own pizza every day since 1984, I personally have not grown one single inch. I have medical documentation, and a sworn affidavit from my wife to prove it.”

1,"Rocker/Activist Ted Nugent, 67, Shoots Beloved Panda","CRAWFORD, Tex. – Rocker/activist Ted Nugent is just one of the millions swept up in the “Find The Panda” craze, but Texas authorities say the hunting rights advocate took things a step too far. Some people who can’t find the panda post angry tirades. Others who spot the panda, share their achievement to social media for all to admire. Gun enthusiast Ted Nugent found the panda, and after he found the panda, he reportedly shot the panda.
“We received a call from a neighbor who reported a domestic shooting incident,” said police dispatcher Ima Friessen. “We learned the shootings were taking place inside Ted Nugent’s property, and we investigated.”



Upon entering Nugent’s home, authorities found Nugent dressed only in a leopard skin thong, firing shots at dozens of computers lined up in his living room.
“Each laptop had a hole blown through it,” said Officer Roger Snart. “Nugent was yelling, ‘I found you, you m— f— panda!’ then he’d blow a hole in the computer. Then he’d start screaming like a madman, and shoot the next laptop. There were maybe a dozen computers blown to pieces when we showed up. He told us everything was ok, the guns were licensed, the computers were his, and he was just ‘hunting pandas,’ and so we left.”
“I hope we don’t have any copycats out there,” said Snart. “Panda bears are endangered, aren’t they? All of his shots were bulls-eyes,” added Snart. “He shot every single one of those panda bears right between the eyes.”
The panda challenge created a number of spinoffs, including a Star Wars Edition, an automobile version called “Find The Fiat Panda,” and inspired a Kentucky woman to bury the bear’s image in a thrift shop-purchased school picture. “As far as we know,” said Officer Snart, “Ted Nugent’s the only one who’s picked up a gun and shot the panda after finding it.”
Said one local resident, “I know why Nugent shot the damn thing. My grandkids showed me the damn picture and I still can’t find the damn panda. Once I find the damn keys to the damn gun cabinet, I’m gonna do the same damn thing!""",N/A,N/A,National Report,~01-10-2016,http://nationalreport.net/rockeractivist-ted-nugent-67-shoots-beloved-panda/,02-11-2016
1,Muslim College Professor Fired for Giving Students Hijabs ,"A Muslim Professor at Carlson Community College (CCC) in North San Jose, California has been relieved of his duties for providing hijabs to his students.
A complaint was called in to police last week sparking an investigation into the Professor’s past and the magnitude of the offense. It is not yet known just how many hijabs have been given out.
Professor Ali Mehmut Agka, a Muslim man of Arabic decent, has an internship at the college having spent the last ten years teaching history and Islamic Affairs courses at CCC. His hijab actions have led to his arrest. Charges are expected to be issued tomorrow morning.
One student raised a complaint where, according to an affidavit filed at the North San Jose Police Department, “The professor lured me into the restroom between classes where he gave me a private hijab.” The report further states that the student felt, “embarrassed and left with low self -esteem.”
A number of students have also reported receiving hijabs from Professor Agka. Incidents of hijab activity have allegedly occurred after hours in the classroom, at the Professor’s own residence, and in the student lavatories.
An unnamed male student reported that while using the toilet, he felt a wide-stance tapping on his foot. When he rose from the seat after finishing his business, he found the professor waiting to give him a hijab.
The boy’s family attorney told this reporter that the teenager has gone through a “horrible ordeal.”
The hijabs gifted by Professor Agka are considered to be home spun and traditionally fashionable. “I believe he (the Professor) was hoping the gift of hijabs become commonplace at the school, with more and more hijabs being given to celebrate Islamic holidays as well as secular school events, like athletic competitions and awards for superior educational performance.  However, polls taken by students indicate that the hijabs are not needed to feel a special sense of accomplishment.
It was also discovered that the professor allegedly gave hijabs to prospective students while working as a summer home instructor. Another student reportedly received a hijab from Agka under the bleachers during the homecoming football game.
A special panel will be discussing the incidents in a closed session next week, it was reported by a representative of the school.

Some feel that the professor is being wrongly persecuted. His wife of thirteen years, also an Arab Muslim, told me that Agka, “has been accused and charged with crimes that do not describe his character. I accepted many hijabs from him and that’s a fact. It seems like the school is making too big a deal out of a few hijabs.
Professor Agka is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.",N/A,N/A,National Report,~12-10-2015,http://nationalreport.net/muslim-college-professor-fired-for-giving-students-hijabs/,02-11-2016
1,University student discovers root cause of global warming ,"An archaeology student at the University of Southern North Dakota at Hoople made the startling discovery while at a site in Egypt.

While working at the site of the Abusir necropolis near Cairo, student Alexandra Knudson casually observed that ‘every time we study history we have to dig’. The off-hand comment almost let to her summary expulsion. Other students began to discuss the possibility and eventually a theory was passed on to the other science departments at the university.

After over two years of study and observations, it was determined that several factors outside of the current climate change ‘consensus’ were actually the cause of the recorded increases in temperature. The earth’s gradually slowing rotation, therefore reduced centrifugal force, has allowed excess space dust and other debris to pile up rather than be thrown back into orbit. By accumulating more material, the diameter of the planet has increased, moving closer to the sun and therefore getting warmer.

Scientists at the university expressed concern that earth’s growing obesity also contributes to the rising sea levels, which in turn leads to melted ice, leading to more exposed land to gather dust continuing the cycle.

When asked how she feels about her discovery, Alex expresses concern that archaeological digs are piling up dirt that may be “throwing the earth off balance and contribute to slowing it down”.

The university plans to publish the details of the study and findings as soon as they can find a scientific journal that doesn’t refer to the data as ‘flat-earth society climate change denier junk’.",N/A,N/A,People's Cube,02-03-2016,http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/university-student-discovers-root-cause-of-global-warming-t17513.html,02-11-2016
1,"Dem, GOP voters agree: Extermination is the only solution","The latest NBC News/Wall St. Journal polling revealed a rare area of agreement between Democrat and Republican voters, namely that both groups now overwhelmingly believe that only the merciless slaughter of the opposing party and its voters can solve America's problems. Among those identifying as Republican, Conservative, or Libertarian, 83 percent favored the wholesale massacre of all liberal freaks, while 87 percent of Democrats, Liberals, and Progressives supported the total liquidation of right-wing lunatics. 

""For most of 2015, and now into 2016, the country's mood was defined by anger at the inexplicable stupidity of the opposition party,"" said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. ""Now that has abruptly changed to the fear that dissenting opinions will destroy America, and the people's universal solution seems to be the annihilation of anyone with a differing point of view.""

“It makes perfect sense if you think about it,” continued Yang. “The Republicans want the poor to starve, the sick to die, and the earth to boil. They oppress minorities, want everyone shooting at each other, and they cling to the First Amendment as if feelings aren't important. We even try to compromise with them: In order to survive, this country desperately needs government to assume complete control over the economy, but Republicans have an aneurysm over a simple revamping of just the healthcare sector. It's time they went extinct. ”

“Unicorn-molesting jackasses,” commented McInturff. “Safe zones, Caitlyn Jenner, crappy solar cars... mandatory school lunches that nobody wants. They'd sooner see another 9-11 or a nuclear Iran than offend a single Muslim. What kind of deranged simpleton thinks that without the rich there would be no poor, without guns there would be no death, or that without bureaucratic oversight we couldn't correctly choose the right light bulb? If it was up to them, we'd have a cabinet position in charge of single-ply toilet paper and another in charge of double-ply. America would be better off if we butchered every last one of them.”

But Democratic pollster Peter Hart cautioned that this consensus could be temporary, especially considering that the two sides cannot agree on a method of execution. “While Democrats trend towards the creation of a government agency that will, over a period of ten years, reduce the budget deficit while systematically determining and carrying out the most tolerant and humane way of killing Republicans, Republicans just want to take Democrats out back and shoot 'em. Let's wait and see whether they can even agree on a bloodbath three months from now.""

1,Berkeley: white students to purchase free-speech insurance,"The University of California has adopted a new policy requiring all students who identify with being Caucasian to purchase mandatory ""Free Speech Insurance"" as part of enrollment fees, $1,000 per-semester, set to begin in the fall semester of 2016. 

The idea had been bouncing around for about a year until the UC Board of Trustees was able to put all the logistics in place. The concept of mandatory Free Speech Insurance (FSI) is based on the belief that ""free speech"" and ""safe spaces"" on campus are mutually exclusive as they stem from fundamentally different belief systems that are diametrically opposed to one another. 

""Words that express unadulterated individual thought are by definition hurtful to those who do not experience such thoughts,"" stated professor Lilly Barnes, instructor in Modern Ethics and Safe-Think during an open forum dedicated to explaining the new policy to students. ""Only by suppressing individual thought and following standards of pre-approved collective thought prepared for you by caring academic professionals, can we achieve the safety of thinking in unison and make our campus a safe space for everyone. This is what my mandatory course in Safe-Think will help you to achieve.""

""The problem with this country,"" continued Barnes, ""is that freely expressed individual ideas almost always lead to delusional thoughts and perceptions that can be described as anti-progressive, racist, sexist, bigoted, or Islamophobic. Unfortunately, we can't yet jail people for unfiltered expression of their Caucasianism as it exists in their unguided and dangerously delusional minds. As a result, many minority students are constantly bombarded with white and heteronormative micro-aggressions, which causes them to suffer extreme mental and emotional traumas. So the next best thing to arresting all white students is to make them purchase mandatory Free Speech Insurance that will be used to compensate for any emotional damage minority students may suffer in accidents caused by unapproved speech or any other expression of non-safe individual thought on our campus.""

""Minority students will be exempt from purchasing FSI because we believe they are incapable of individual thought and don't have the capacity to reason and act independently,"" Barnes said. ""But a white mouth that is free to speak, is no less dangerous than an assault machine gun. I see it everywhere I go on this campus. I become alarmed whenever I see a group of white students standing around without a single minority in their midst. I am not deaf, I can clearly hear them talk about things like movies, or video games, or even sports - without acknowledging how their white privilege provided them with those opportunities. It makes me want to vomit."" 

Professor Barnes further illustrated her point with a recent example of the damages caused by unregulated freedom of expression on campus. It happened when an African-American student overheard a group of Asian students saying that the boycott of the Oscars was ""ridiculous"" while they were all having lunch in one of the University's cafeterias. The fact that this blatant microaggression did not come directly from Caucasian students made things even worse, as the well-trained African-American student was still able to detect white racism compounded by cultural appropriation, which raised the incident classification to ""aggravated assault."" This made the African-American student so emotionally distraught that they could not attend class for three weeks and now they require costly biweekly therapy visits. 

That is where Free Speech Insurance will come in. It will cover the cost of the therapy and rehabilitation of victims of unregulated, freely expressed Caucasian ideas. Even in cases when the offensive speech does not come from white students directly but is culturally appropriated from them by misguided minorities, the burden of payment will still be distributed among the Caucasians whose fault it is that offensive ideas exist in the first place.

To further the University's goal of making the campus ""a universal safe space,"" the institution has also announced that it will be removing courses that focus on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights since those documents are believed to ""encourage division and bigotry among the student body"" by promoting criminally delusional ideas of individual freedom, thought, and expression. These courses will be replaced with professor Lilly Barnes's collectivist ""Safe-Think"" and other classes that promote intellectual unanimity and emotional awareness of hurtful and offensive speech, all of which should lead to lower FSI premiums in the future. 

According to the official statement, the school administrators are hopeful they will live to see the day when Free Speech Insurance will no longer be required as all students will be properly trained in collectivism and unanimous thinking, providing a safe learning environment for everyone on the UC Berkeley campus.",N/A,N/A,People's Cube,01-30-2016,http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/uc-berkeley-white-students-must-purchas-free-speech-insurance-t17497.html,02-11-2016
1,True story: Stalin extracted and analyzed Mao's excrement ,"If you cringe at NSA's methods of gathering dirt on world leaders, consider what the KGB had been gathering to achieve similar results. According to the Russian media, in the 1940s Stalin's secret police had set up a special department to get its hands on foreign leaders' excrement with the ambitious aim of constructing psychological portraits by analyzing their feces. Believe it or not, the story has passed the BBC smell test.

Chairman Mao became the first foreign leader whose stool was stolen by the KGB. 
 
Retired KGB agent Igor Atamanenko, who claims he had uncovered this project while doing research in the archives of the Russian secret services, told the BBC correspondent that ""in those days the Soviets didn't have the kind of listening devices which secret services do today. That's why our specialists came up with the most extravagant ways of extracting information about a person."" 

Stalin's head henchman and KGB chief, Lavrenti Beria, supervised the secret stool-spying operation and reported the results personally to Stalin.

In an interview with the Russian-language AIF, Atamanenko was more specific. According to him, this method was used for the first time in 1950, during Mao Zedong's visit to Moscow. Atamanenko claims that Mao and his comrades were made to wait ten days at the Kremlin reception before Stalin let them in. Some historians believe this was Stalin's way to establish dominance and bring the Chinese delegation down to size. But according to Atamanenko, Stalin himself waited that long for his agents to collect and analyze Mao's multiple stool samples for a psychological profile, so that the Soviet leader would know just what kind of man he was dealing with.

The KGB plumbers had reportedly customized Mao's toilet so the Chairman's stool was extracted to a secret box and delivered to the KGB secret lab by a special courier (one wonders if the courier's title included the words ""stool pigeon"").

The problem with that plan was that Mao didn't know how to use a toilet. According to the Kremlin guards assigned to the Chinese delegation, neither the Chairman nor any of the 50 other revolutionaries who accompanied him to Moscow knew the purpose of the white porcelain contraptions and used them as water fountains. Additionally, Mao spent his nights sleeping on the floor mat by the bed, while most of his fellow comrades slept in the closets because after years of hiding in the caves many of them had developed agoraphobia. 

Mao's excrement was examined by a crack team of KGB analysts including endocrinologists, physiologists, immunologists, diagnosticians, psychologists, and neurologists. Having examined the resulting psychological portrait, Stalin finally met with Mao Zedong. He thanked his spy team saying, ""Your conclusions were correct: this man is a radish. He's only red on the outside, but his inside is white."" (The ""white"" reference had nothing to do with race; in the communist jargon of the day ""white"" meant ""anti-red,"" as in the ""White Army"" that fought against the Red Army while wearing white uniforms.)

The veteran KGB agent also claims that Nikita Khrushchev, who assumed power in 1954, put an end to this and other similar secret KGB projects. But the Soviet visionary scientist behind this idea emigrated to Israel and soon wound up in America, where his research was picked up by the CIA and used to analyze Khrushchev's excrement during his visit to the United States in September, 1959. 

Khrushchev's portable commode that accompanied him on his 12-day trip across America, which included New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Des Moines, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC, had been allegedly altered by the CIA to extract the Soviet leader's stool samples. The toilet at Camp David, where Khrushchev met with President Eisenhower, had also been modified, says Atamanenko. 

He also claims that the CIA spiked Khrushchev's food with laxatives to ensure the abundance of research data. It is unclear how the retired KGB veteran came in possession of this information, but it is worth mentioning that at a press conference following Camp David, Khrushchev acknowledged that he had been ""enriched"" by his visit and that his talks with Eisenhower had helped both men ""understand each other better.""
 
A similar story allegedly happened during Leonid Brezhnev's American trip in 1973. 

Atamanenko doesn't say how he knows this, but we found circumstantial evidence in the U.S. media reports about a noticeable chemistry and even bromance between Brezhnev and Richard Nixon. 

What had prompted Nixon to discover a soulmate in the Soviet leader is anyone's guess, but the KGB veteran's revelations may finally put this issue to rest. 

Atamanenko provides no comment on the reasons why Ronald Reagan walked out of negotiations on strategic missiles with Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1986 summit in Reykjavik, but in light of this new information we may deduce that Gorbachev's stool sample that day posed a serious security risk.

The veteran Soviet agent finishes his story with a tale about the six golden toilets in the residence of Hafez al-Assad, former Syrian ruler and father of today's Syrian dictator, Bashar Assad. Only after Hafez al-Assad's death in 2000 did the Syrian intelligence discover that the toilets had been designed to separate the fluids from the solids, and contained a vacuum mechanism that sucked out the content and prepared it for the ""dead drop."" Russian intelligence, which is said to be involved in this discovery, pointed the finger at Israel and the CIA, but it's also possible they were simply cleaning up their own mess. 

While both the FSB and CIA can neither confirm nor deny that they spent decades examining each other's feces, the public can always rely on applicable common-sense rules: who observed it served it, who deduced it produced it, who denied it supplied it, and who smelt it dealt it.

No matter how touching we may find the vision of a world whose leaders learn about each other's personalities from each other's excrement, let's keep in mind that the story of the American research into the Soviet leaders' stool samples may well be a ""journalistic deodorant"" sprayed over Stalin's ""fecal espionage"" story when it leaked to the media. Russian officials have the penchant for preemptive damage control by polluting the media narrative with manufactured counter-narrative, making up nonsensical chaff stories that compete for attention on equal terms with objective reality. This way, even when the stolen stool hits the fan, they can always say, ""everybody's doing it.""

And yet we can't help but wonder: what exactly is happening during the prolonged negotiations in Geneva - and could more fiber in the menu expedite the process? 

In particular, how exactly did the U.S. and the Iranian delegations test each other's mettle during the recent nuclear talks in Paris, and what did John Kerry and Barack Obama find out about the Iranians that convinced them they can be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain?

And finally, in the pre-computer age, how would a whistleblower like Snowden go about exposing such a dirty government secret to the public? And even if he managed to steal what we might now call the ""data dump"" in its physical form and gave it to a Wikileaks-type organization, how would that outfit go about blasting it all over the world? The more I think about it, the more grateful I am for living in the modern digital age.",N/A,N/A,People's Cube,02-02-2016,http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/kgb-agent-stalin-extracted-and-analyzed-mao-s-excrement-t17511.html,02-11-2016
1,Bernie Sanders: capital punishment for Martin Shkreli ,"For not cutting the pill costs and for being rich, Bernie Sanders is throwing Karl Marx’s book at Martin Shkreli, the Big Pharma executive who is responsible for a 4,000% price hike and who also donated $2,700 to Sanders in an attempt to bribe his way out of this. It is, however, too late for this entrepreneurial swine: Sanders is so disgusted with Martin Shkreli, he doesn't rule out capital punishment.

Shkreli has not responded to our questions on Twitter, either blocking or ignoring them, even though we thought our questions were extremely equal. That was his biggest mistake; it is not advisable to ignore supporters of the progressive cause.

No one should be fooled by this evil capitalist pig's ""Bernie support."" First, he has profited from the poor and the unfortunate, and second, he owns a company. At a congressional hearing, he smiled too many times at the Democrats and RINOs, shamelessly quoting the useless and outdated U.S. Constitution in front of our representatives. Every progressive watching this was screaming on the inside, ""Put him in jail and transfer the company to the state!"" And if you didn't scream this on the inside, you are not progressive enough, just like Hillary Clinton.

Martin Shkreli had the audacity to challenge Sanders to a public debate, to which Sanders responded by challenging Shkreli to a show trial. This will teach the people that under Bernie Sanders presidency capitalist crimes will not be ignored, that those who are not spreading the wealth shall be severely punished, and that no one can be allowed to own or run any company outside of the state.

1,103-YEAR-OLD MAN SEEKS VOLUNTEER TO LOSE VIRGINITY BEFORE HE DIES,"BIG HORN, WY | A Wyoming man who celebrated his 103rd birthday yesterday has vowed to lose his virginity before his death, claims the family of the century-old man.

After blowing out the 103 candles on his birthday cake yesterday, the old man reportedly told his family his desire to “get laid” for the first time before ending up six feet under.

“Let’s just say it took us by surprise,” admits his niece, Laura Atkins. “We did not expect this at all! But when he told us, we gave ourselves the mission to do everything in our power to fulfill his wish,” she told local reporters. “He has done so much for us and our community, we may as well help him dip his wick once in his life” acknowledges his great-nephew, Anthony Atkins.

The family of the century-old man says they are ready to do anything possible to fulfill his dream of “getting laid” before he dies
Mission “impossible”

The family has faced several obstacles since the beginning of their quest for a sexual partner for the old man.

“In Big Horn, we’ve got tons of horny women, but escorts don’t grow on trees!” says with a laugh 24-year-old Johnny Atkins. “There is only one prostitute in town, but she just won’t have sex with the old geezer, even for $200, she won’t give him a blowjob” he admits, visibly annoyed.

Over $600 for an escort

A woman from the region has proposed her services after hearing about the unusual demand on social networks.

“There is a woman living out in Owl Creek, a few hundred miles out of here, but she’s charging us 600$ and that doesn’t include transportation, lodging and food,” claims another family member. “And we don’t know how long the sex is going to last, over $600 for 30 seconds of pleasure is a heck of a price to pay!” he acknowledges. “But hey, we don’t really have a choice!” he adds. “We’re just afraid the old man’s heart won’t survive the banging, but hey, it’s a risk worth taking,” he admits with concern.

1,TAIWAN: MH370 PILOT MYSTERIOUSLY RESURFACES ALMOST 2 YEARS AFTER HIS FLIGHT VANISHED OVER CHINA SEA,"Taipei| The pilot of the infamous flight MH370 of Malaysia Airlines that disappeared in March 2013, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has mysteriously reappeared in a Taiwan hospital on Monday, suffering from severe dehydration and some type of amnesia.

The 53-year-old pilot was transported at the Taipei Adventist Hospital by a couple of villagers from a nearby town. They claimed to have found the man while he was  lying unconscious on the banks of the Tangshui River.

He finally woke up almost 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, but couldn’t remember his name or how he arrived in Taipei. He was rapidly identified, however, thanks to his fingerprints, instantly attracting a lot of attention from the media and from various Asian governments.

The doctors who have been treating since his arrival believe that he may be suffering from regressive amnesia, caused by a major stress or life-threatening situation.

“The patient seems to have undergone a lot of stress lately, and the amnesia is probably an unconscious self-defense mechanism,” claims Dr. Syed Boon Sulong. “The patient is still very weak and sick, and his brain seems to be blocking access to a certain part of his memory, in order to protect him from pain that these memories could generate. His health is too fragile for the moment, but over time, he should able to remember everything.”

Dr. Sulong says that it is impossible to say how long it will take before his patient is able to regain his memory, but he is convinced that over time, he should be able to overcome his amnesia.
Many people hope that Captain Shah will now be able to bring answers concerning Malaysia Airlines ‘s Boeing 777-200ER, that disappeared on 8 March 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Despite all the efforts of the international community, the faith of the infamous flight remains unclear, almost 2 years after the events. Hopefully, as Mr. Shah recovers his memory, he should be able to bring answers to many questions concerning the 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations that were on board.",N/A,N/A,World News Daily Report,02-10-2016,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/taiwan-mh370-pilot-mysteriously-resurfaces-almost-2-years-after-his-flight-vanished-over-china-sea/,02-11-2016
1,RUSSIA: MAN GROWS GILLS AFTER HAVING FISH GENES ADDED TO HIS DNA,"Moscow| Russian scientists have just accomplished an incredible feat which could represent a major breakthrough in the domain of genetics: they were able to grow some functioning gills on a 27-year old man by adding some fish genes to his DNA strand.

The young patient, a scuba diving enthusiast named Alexei Olegovich Zakharchenko, volunteered for the experiment in 2012, hoping to be able to breath underwater without a diving mask.

The scientists of the Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics of the N.I. Pirogov Russian State Medical University, led by Professor Ivan Arturovich Vedenin, were able to modify the man’s DNA permanently after almost two years of constant treatment, causing his body to change drastically.

Mr. Zakharchenko is now able to breath underwater, but only to some extent, as his lungs are stills adapting to the apparition of his new breathing organs.

“It’s a really strange feeling to breath underwater,” claims the young man. “I can really inhale some air and all, but I still feel a bit like I’m drowning… But it’s still awesome. Soon, I’ll be able to dive without any equipment, just like a fish!”

Professor Vedenin says the “drowning” sensation should disappear over the next few months, as his body adapts and get used to receiving oxygen from the gills.

“It is totally normal for such major physical changes to necessitate a time of adaptation,” says the famous geneticist. “The important thing is that it works! If everything goes as planned, he should be fully capable of breathing underwater in about six months.”

According to Professor Vedenin, this discovery paves the way for countless new possibilities in genetics, maybe even growing wings on a human being.
Mr. Zakharchenko will now continue his treatment and training for a few months, in order to fully adapt to his new organs.

He then hopes to be able to tour around the world in order to scuba dive and sing the praises of Russian biotechnology. He hopes that his example will encourage others to go through the same operation, and will be able to enjoy being underwater as much as he does.",N/A,N/A,World News Daily Report,01-27-2016,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/russia-man-grows-gills-after-having-fish-genes-added-to-his-dna/,02-11-2016
1,SMITHSONIAN EMPLOYEE ACCUSED OF RAPING 2500-YEAR OLD MUMMY,"Washington, DC| A security guard of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History was arrested this morning, for allegedly having sex with one of the mummies of the Egyptian exhibition.

44-year old James Monroe, has worked as a night watchman for the reputed museum for the last nine years, and was almost considered a model employee until his divorce two years ago.

According to his colleagues, he suddenly became very depressed and short-tempered, and began behaving rather strangely. On two occasions, his superior even noticed that one of the mummies seemed to have been damaged during his watch, leading to the installation of some new video cameras.

The images captured by these cameras were far more disturbing than what his boss expected.

The cameras caught Mr. Monroe on Monday evening, opening the glass display case protecting the 2500-year old Egyptian mummy, lying down on top of it and sexually aggressing it. The Smithsonian fired the watchman and  brought the images to the police, filing charges against their former employee for indecent exposure and destruction of property.

“The security video that the Smithsonian has provided us is really disgusting,” says D.C Police Chief, Cathy Lynn Lanier. “I understand that the mummy is not really a victim of sex crimes, but his behavior certainly caused some damages to the property of the Smithsonian, therefore, his behavior is criminal. And let’s be honest, I think he really needs help.”

The mummy was slightly damaged during Mr. Monroe’s sexual assaults, particularly in the groin area, but is still in rather good condition. The corpse is believed to have belonged to a man of the upper class, who died around 500 BC.
Mr Monroe will undergo a psychiatric assessment before the beginning of the court procedures, in order to determine if he is able to stand trial.

This process should take a few weeks, meaning Mr Monroe will probably come back in court only in March.",N/A,N/A,World News Daily Report,01-28-2016,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/smithsonian-employee-accused-of-raping-2500-year-old-mummy/,02-11-2016
1,"HERMAPHRODITE IMPREGNATES SELF, GIVES BIRTH TO HERMAPHRODITE TWINS","MANILA, Philippines | Jose Maria Garcia, a 19-year old born with both ovaries and testicles and who has both male and female sex organs has given birth this morning at the Amisola Maternity Hospital, reports the Manila Times. 

Both babies were also born hermaphrodites, displaying physical characteristics and genitals of both genders, a “miraculous event” according to Dr. Xi Huan Chow, Medical director at Amisola Maternity Hospital.

“We are privileged to experience such an unusual birth” he told reporters, visibly happy with the turn of events. “Hundreds of people have come to witness these miracles of nature. Both babies are extremely healthy and vibrant with life,” he explained with enthusiasm.

The two hermaphrodite twins were named Hermes and Aphrodite, both parents of the god Hermaphroditus in Greek mythology
An unexpected birth

Jose Maria Garcia, the mother and father of the two children, admits the birth was not expected at all.

“I have never had any sexual experience with someone outside of myself. I was unaware that I could impregnate myself, but I would never go back even with what I know now. These children are beautiful and I am happy to share my life with them,” he told reporters.

An extremely rare chromosomal disorder

Most experts believe such an occurrence is impossible outside of the animal kingdom, although many cases of human self-fertilization have been reported in medical literature, explains leading researcher Dr. Akira Hashimoto of the University of Tokyo.

Dr. Akira Hashimoto of the University of Tokyo admits there are many cases of human self-fertilization that have been reported in medical literature
“In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. For example, a great number of snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates,” he acknowledges. “The evolution of sexual reproduction is still a major puzzle for biologists,” he admits.

The first account of self-fertilization in history is ascribed to Juanita Franciscella, a Spanish street artist also known as the “bearded woman of Castilla”, who in 1483 is said to have given birth to a child of her own conception.

1,Earl Cowan cast as Wicked Witch in stage production of the Wizard of Oz,"“You are a lying piece of shit . . . and your little dog, too: you’re all lying pieces of shit!”

Presumed Conservative party supporter and lunatic Earl Cowan has been tapped to play The Wicked Witch of the West in Royal Canadian Stratford Company’s [RCSC] production of The Wizard of Oz, set to visit 11 cities across Canada this fall.

Most famously known for shouting profanities at reporters during a campaign event for Conservative Leader Stephen Harper, Cowan has no known acting experience, but the self-appointed officer of the morality police is said to understand that acting is an acceptable form of lying.

Nicole Hillby, senior casting director for the left wing commie pinko piece of shit RCSC said she heard Cowan on the news and knew she’d found her witch.

“Taking a bona fide, certifiable curmudgeon and placing him in the role of the Wicked Witch . . . it’s genius,” said Hillby.

This isn’t the first time a gender specific role has been played by a member of the opposite sex, Hillby points out; but she does expect audience members and the public to react in different ways.

“Maybe someone will, I don’t know, call us out for it,” she said. “Inform us we’re idiots, and something-something about taxes.”

1,CBC severs ties with Peter Mansbridge for allegedly failing to use reusable grocery bags,"TORONTO — The CBC has severed ties with its chief correspondent and host of The National, Peter Mansbridge, saying it determined his environmental stance on the use of grocery shopping bags failed to meet the network’s code of ethics.

Just hours after receiving an anonymous tip that Mansbridge had his groceries bagged in non-biodegradable plastic bags that can suffocate small children and that contribute to the environmental crisis plaguing Canadian cities, the CBC released a statement on Twitter, reading, “Your turkey’s toast, Peter.”

The departure of Mansbridge, a 162-year veteran of the CBC, is the third in a string of controversial terminations in recent months. Earlier this week, Evan Solomon was terminated for selling art like a Machiavellian son of a bitch, and in 2014 Jian Ghomeshi was fired for being allowed to be creepy-as-fuck for way too long of time.

1,Calgary councillor introduces motion to have all dogs’ teeth pulled in light of recent dog attacks,"Ward 15 Councillor Charlie Bain introduced a motion Friday that would require all Calgary dog owners to remove their dog’s teeth, regardless of breed, before the dog turns six months old.

The motion comes after several dog attacks in the city in recent weeks, and Bain is confident that without teeth, dogs will not feel the need to bite people.

“Dogs are born killers. No creature needs teeth as sharp and long as those in dogs,” Bain said. “Especially when there are soft dog food options out there.”

Under Bain’s proposal, once a dog has had its teeth removed—either by a licensed veterinarian, dentist, or by those rusty old pliers sitting in the garage—the dog will be required to attend eight weeks of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) classes, where the dog will focus on identifying dysfunctional self-talk in order to change unwanted behaviours such as biting humans.

Dr. Stella Gemini, the self-proclaimed leading authority on animal behaviour—whose infomercial can be seen Sunday nights at 2:00 a.m. on channel 192—says Bain requested her expertise when he called-in two weeks ago.

“Dogs will learn how their behaviour is the result of their own self-verbalizations,” says Gemini. “Through self-observation and recognizing their negative self-talk, dogs can begin to change it.”

And of course they have no teeth.

Neil Foster, who owns a 110-pound teacup Rottweiler named Rambo, says the bill unfairly targets nice dogs like his.

“The neighbour down the street has a bitchy, yappy Chihuahua who goes right for my ankles every goddam time I walk to the mailbox,” Foster said. “ It’s those little dogs that are the problem, not my precious Rambo.”

The City is looking at other solutions, including making all dogs wear masks and capes like its Halloween or something, and arming every Calgarian with a pellet gun.

1,Calgary Flames to convert former Target location into new arena,"After years of speculation and rumours, the Calgary Flames have officially unveiled plans to convert an old Target location in the city’s northwest into their new world class arena.

The new state of the art facility attached to Market Mall will house a Starbucks location, escalators that can move visitors and their friend being pushed in a shopping cart because they’re too drunk too walk (it’s the infamous heroin beer) between levels, and easy access to dozens of nearby amenities such as New York Fries and the Sunglass Hut.

The NHL team jumped on the Market Mall location after the failure that was Target’s ‘Canadian invasion’ caused the retailer to pull out of the country leaving 133 possible-arena locations up for grabs.

Flames Vice President, Pete Cummings, says the new location is ideal, and will be a tremendous improvement over the aging Saddledome–one of the oldest arenas in the NHL currently in use.

“We’ll be cramming over 18,000 seats into the location,” says Cummings. “6,000 on the lover level, and 12,000 on the upper level. And as a bonus, the new building was already painted red inside.”

The new facility will not have stadium seating, but Cummings insists views of the rink will be great from every section.

Typically, stadiums around the world position seats such that they are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them so that the occupants of further-back seats have less of their views blocked by those further forward, but the Flames believe they have found a solution for that.

“Mirrors,” says Cummings. “We will be strategically placing mirrors throughout the facility so that every section has an unobstructed view of the ice surface.”

Reactions over the new arena from hockey fans were mixed. Dale Roberts, a season ticket holder since 2004 says he won’t be renewing his seats over parking fears.

“Have you even been to Market mall on a Saturday?” blared Roberts. “And what about around Christmas time for crying out loud. It’s a bona fide gong show.”

Roberts thinks a better location would have been North Hill Mall, because it’s always dead and the C-Train is nearby.

“I mean, Sears is a good as dead, anyway—that would have been a good spot.”

Others including Joanne Neufeld are cautiously optimistic.

“I guess it won’t be so bad.” said Neufeld. “I actually didn’t even know Calgary had a professional basketball team.”

The team is slated to move-in to their new arena in 2017. The Saddledome is slated to be demolished after then, hopefully taking with it the city’s western cowboy identity that has hovered over the city for too long.",N/A,N/A,Urban Anomie,07-01-2015,http://urbananomie.com/2015/07/01/calgary-flames-to-convert-former-target-location-into-new-arena/,02-11-2016
0,"TSX continues fall, joins global equity markets rout","Canadian stocks slumped a fifth day, joining a selloff in markets around the world amid waning confidence central banks can support the global economy, as commodities prices fall and growth stalls.

The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 159.9 points, or 1.31 per cent, to 12,025.82 at 1:46 p.m. in Toronto, extending losses after slumping 4.6 per cent in the past four days. Canada’s benchmark equity gauge remains the second best-performing developed market in the world in 2016 with a decline of 7.6 per cent behind only New Zealand, after being among the worst in the past year.

“Our outlook call has been to be ready for anything and this is what we’re getting now,” said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments in Toronto. His firm manages about $12.3-billion. “We need to get to a stage where there’s some more pain, weed out the people who are very bearish and then get back to the fundamentals of the markets. We don’t see this as a buying opportunity yet in equities and we have a risk-off trade if anything.”

A nascent rally in Canada’s equity benchmark in recent weeks has dissipated as global stocks tumbled amid diminishing returns from central bank actions and New York crude resumed its downward slide below $30 a barrel. The S&P/TSX slid into a bear market last month as crude prices collapsed due to a global supply glut.

The MSCI All-Country World Index of developed and developing markets is poised to enter a bear market from the most recent May 2015 high. U.S. equities extended losses as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s interest rate comments Wednesday failed to inspire lasting gains. The latest central bank moves this week follow the Bank of Japan’s surprise shift to negative interest rates and the European Central Bank’s signal it will deploy new stimulus next month.

“Everything is off today,” said Greg Taylor, fund manager at Aurion Capital Management in Toronto. His firm manages about $7.2-billion. “You have got the fear of what’s going on in the global market. Everyone is looking at negative rates in Europe and Japan, and trying to figure out what that means to the banking system.”

Financials and health-care stocks contributed the biggest declines to the S&P/TSX on Thursday. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, the nation’s largest lenders, each fell at least 1.85 per cent. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. lost 4 per cent.

Manulife Financial Corp., the nation’s largest life insurer, sank 9.9 per cent for the biggest decline in more than four years after profit slumped in the fourth quarter due to the company’s energy-related investments.

Raw-material shares jumped 4 per cent as gold producers surged. Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. rallied at least 3.6 per cent. Gold prices jumped as investors sought a haven investment against the selloff in stocks.

Cenovus Energy Inc. rose 2 per cent after the energy producer slashed its dividend by 69 per cent and said it will cut more jobs and further reduce its 2016 spending in an effort to retain cash amid a slide in crude and natural gas prices.

U.S. stocks fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing as much as 400 points, as investors shunned risk worldwide amid concern that central-bank efforts to support growth are losing their potency.

Equities trimmed losses, with energy stocks paring declines, after a report said OPEC is ready to cooperate on cutting production. Banks led the early retreat, with Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. falling more than 6 percent. Equities extended losses as Boeing Co. tumbled 8 per cent after people familiar with the matter said regulators are probing its accounting.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,830.69 at 2:48 p.m. in New York, headed toward the longest losing streak since September as it extended declines to a fifth day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to edge closer to a 20 percent drop from its record set in July. The Dow lost 234.63 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 15,680.11, after earlier falling to its lowest level since February 2014. Boeing’s plunge knocked 58 points off the index.

“Central bank policies and the uncertainty around their effectiveness is the big macro concern right now,” said Leo Grohowski, who helps manage more than $184 billion in client assets as chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. “There’s a large disconnect right now between what the Fed might do and what they’re saying and what the market is expecting. There’s a lot of Fed uncertainty back on the table reminiscent of late last summer.”

Signals by central banks from Europe to Japan that additional stimulus is at the ready are failing to ease worries that global growth will keep slowing. An initial rally in U.S. stocks evaporated in the final hour of trading on Wednesday as speculation that the Federal Reserve will hold off longer on raising interest rates gave way to renewed concern over the strength of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress yesterday that recent market turbulence may weigh on the outlook for the economy if it persists.

The S&P 500 is 14 per cent below its all-time high set in May, near its lowest level in two years. The Nasdaq Composite Index is about 19 percent below its record set in July amid a more than 15 percent drop so far this year.

Declines in banks have been the biggest source of pain for U.S. equities in the market’s latest rout -- a gauge of financial shares on the S&P 500 has slumped almost 18 per cent just this year, to its lowest level since 2013. With global stocks on the brink of a bear market, trading volumes remain high and volatility is on the rise.

“Energy companies have passed the ball to financials, because that’s where they get their money,” said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. “When problems spring up anywhere, they inevitably find their way back to the financial sector.”

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 8.6 percent Thursday to 28.56, on the way to a five-month high. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX has jumped more than 56 percent this year.

The U.S. earnings season hasn’t provided much of a relief even though more than three-quarters of companies that have reported so far have exceeded analysts’ profit estimates. Some 21 members of the S&P 500 are scheduled to release financial results today, including American International Group Inc. and CBS Corp. Analysts estimate S&P 500 earnings fell 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, and will continue to contract in the following two periods.

While the S&P 500’s valuation of 15.1 times the forecast earnings of its members is in line with the average of the past five years, the measure has plunged 13 percent since the start of the year and is at the lowest level since October 2014. The gauge remains more expensive than developed markets in Europe, where the Stoxx 600 Index trades for 13.4 times estimated earnings.

All of the S&P 500’s 10 main industries fell Thursday, with financial and industrial shares down more than 2 per cent. Phone and consumer discretionary companies were the only groups losing less than 0.5 per cent.

Banks in the benchmark are down 3.9 per cent, headed toward the biggest one-day drop in more than five months. The group has lost nearly 12 percent this month, on pace for the worst in more than five years.

Losses in Boeing weighed on industrial shares in the S&P 500 as well as the Dow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of two of its best known jetliners, according to people with knowledge of the matter. General Electric Co. and Union Pacific Corp. lost at least 3.4 per cent.

Cisco Systems Inc. rallied 10 per cent, the most since May 2013, after predicting sales that may beat some analysts’ estimates. The gains helped blunt some of the pain in the Nasdaq Composite. Also helping, Tesla Motors Inc. added 6.4 per cent after assurances that it’s on track with development of its long-awaited Model 3, while TripAdvisor Inc. surged 16 per cent on a better-than-estimated quarterly profit. Expedia Inc. jumped 8.3 per cent after forecasting earnings would grow as much as 45 per cent this year.

Oil tumbled to lowest level in more than 12 years as crude stockpiles at the delivery point for New York futures expanded to a record.

West Texas Intermediate futures dropped to $26.13 a barrel, breaking below the $26.19 low from January to reach the lowest since May 2003. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, rose by 523,000 barrels to 64.7 million last week, according to government data. The site is considered full at 73 million barrels. The price difference between front-month WTI delivery and a month later was near the widest in five years.

“This is a hangover from yesterday’s Cushing data,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. “Global equities, currencies and bonds are being taken as negative demand indicators. We’re set to soon break the lows made last month and then $25 will be the big target.”

Oil is down about 29 percent this year on speculation a global glut will persist as Iranian exports increase after the removal of sanctions and U.S. crude inventories remain swollen. U.S. stockpiles are more than 130 million barrels above the five-year average, even after dropping by 754,000 barrels, according to Energy Information Administration data.

WTI for March delivery dropped $1.24, or 4.5 per cent, to settle at $26.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 88 per cent higher than the 100-day average. The March-April spread widened to $2.62 a barrel, widest gap for the front two contracts since 2011.

Brent for April settlement declined 88 cents to $29.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

“The Brent-WTI spread is widening again, which has me wondering if we are getting close to seeing a rise in exports,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $3.6 billion in assets. “It would be good for WTI, not so for Brent.”",N/A,N/A,Globe and Mail,02-11-2016,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/market-updates/tsx-continues-fall-joins-global-equity-markets-rout/article28718385/,02-11-2016
0,"Detection of gravitational waves opens door to new way of studying universe
","Scientists have for the first time detected gravitational waves, ripples in space and time hypothesized by Albert Einstein a century ago, in a landmark discovery announced on Thursday that opens a new window for studying the cosmos.

The researchers said they detected gravitational waves coming from two distant black holes - extraordinarily dense objects whose existence also was foreseen by Einstein - that orbited one another, spiralled inward and smashed together. They said the waves were the product of a collision between two black holes roughly 30 times the mass of the Sun, located 1.3 billion light years from Earth.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. We did it,” said California Institute of Technology physicist David Reitze, triggering applause at a packed news conference in Washington.

“It’s been a very long road, but this is just the beginning,” Louisiana State University physicist Gabriela Gonzalez told the news conference, touting the opening of a new era in astronomy.

The scientific milestone was achieved using a pair of giant laser detectors in the United States, located in Louisiana and Washington state, capping a decades-long quest to find these waves.

“The colliding black holes that produced these gravitational waves created a violent storm in the fabric of space and time, a storm in which time speeded up, and slowed down, and speeded up again, a storm in which the shape of space was bent in this way and that way,” Caltech physicist Kip Thorne said.

The two laser instruments, which work in unison, are known as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). They were able to detect remarkably small vibrations from passing gravitational waves. After detecting the gravitational wave signal, the scientists said they converted it into audio waves and were able to listen to the sounds of the two black holes merging.

“We’re actually hearing them go thump in the night,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Matthew Evans said. “We’re getting a signal which arrives at Earth, and we can put it on a speaker, and we can hear these black holes go, ’Whoop.’ There’s a very visceral connection to this observation.”

The scientists said they first detected the gravitational waves last Sept. 14.

“We are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy,” MIT astrophysicist Nergis Mavalvala said in an interview. “We have turned on a new sense. We have been able to see and now we will be able to hear as well.”

Einstein in 1916 proposed the existence of gravitational waves as an outgrowth of his ground-breaking general theory of relativity, which depicted gravity as a distortion of space and time triggered by the presence of matter. But until now scientists had found only indirect evidence of their existence.

Scientists said gravitational waves open a door for a new way to observe the universe and gain knowledge about enigmatic objects like black holes and neutron stars. By studying gravitational waves they also hope to gain insight into the nature of the very early universe, which has remained mysterious.

Everything we know about the cosmos stems from electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, visible light, infrared light, X-rays and gamma rays. But because such waves encounter interference as they travel across the universe, they can tell only part of the story.

Gravitational waves experience no such barriers, meaning they can offer a wealth of additional information. Black holes, for example, do not emit light, radio waves and the like, but can be studied via gravitational waves.

The scientists said that because gravitational waves are so radically different from electromagnetic waves they expect them to reveal big surprises about the universe.

Scientists sounded positively giddy over the discovery.

“This is the holy grail of science,” said Rochester Institute of Technology astrophysicist Carlos Lousto. “The last time anything like this happened was in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz detected the radio waves that had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell’s field-equations of electromagnetism in 1865,” added Durham University physicist Tom McLeish.

“It is really a truly, truly exciting event,” said Abhay Ashtekar, director of Penn State University’s Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos. “It opens a brand new window on the universe.”

Ashtekar said heavy celestial objects bend space and time but because of the relative weakness of the gravitational force the effect is miniscule except from massive and dense bodies like black holes and neutron stars. He said that when these objects collide, they send out ripples in the curvature of space and time that propagate as gravitational waves.

A black hole, a region of space so packed with matter that not even photons of light can escape the force of gravity, was detected for the first time in 1971.

Neutron stars are small, about the size of a city, but are extremely heavy, the compact remains of a larger star that died in a supernova explosion.

0,UN Secretary-General welcomes ‘very warm’ relations with Canada,"United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is welcoming Canada’s renewed commitment to the world body, which the Prime Minister said will include a plan to seek a non-permanent seat on the Security Council and a pledge to support more UN peacekeeping operations.

Mr. Ban met with Justin Trudeau in a chilly Ottawa on Thursday, part of a three-day visit to Canada. His tour comes as the Liberal government, celebrating its 100th day in office, looks to reinvigorate relations with the international institution.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the weather here is quite cold, but the relationship between the United Nations and Canada are very, very warm,” Mr. Ban said during a joint press conference with the Prime Minister. “Mr. Trudeau has declared Canada’s recommitment to the United Nations. I am here to declare that the United Nations … welcomes this commitment.”

Part of that re-engagement process is an eventual bid for a rotating, non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Mr. Trudeau said, repeating a promise he made during the election campaign. However, the Prime Minister did not indicate when Canada would launch its bid.

“We’re looking at a number of windows in the coming years. We’re going to evaluate the opportunities for Canada to mount a successful bid and we will have more to say about that in due course,” Mr. Trudeau said.

The former Conservative government was often highly critical of the UN after a failed bid to win a Security Council seat in 2010.

Mr. Ban also acknowledged former Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson’s efforts to “pioneer” UN peacekeeping and applauded Mr. Trudeau’s commitment to involve the country in more peacekeeping missions. Mr. Trudeau said Canada is interested in working in areas where sexual violence is used a weapon of war. He also took some suggestions from Mr. Ban.

“One of the suggestions that I greatly appreciate and that we will consider is having Canada send in not just more police officers, but more women, female police officers, in order to provide assistance,” Mr. Trudeau said in French. “I acknowledge the importance of having francophone, bilingual forces involved.”

Mr. Trudeau said the government is currently in talks with the UN to see how Canada can re-engage in peacekeeping missions, but did not indicate any regions or countries it would be interested in doing so.

The pair also discussed Canada’s climate change commitments, including Mr. Trudeau’s leadership at the Paris climate summit last year, the ongoing crisis in global hot spots such as Syria and Iraq, and the government’s plan to resettle tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.

Mr. Ban said this is the fifth time he has travelled to Canada as secretary-general, and the first time since Mr. Trudeau took office. Mr. Ban’s term ends in December.

Mr. Ban and Mr. Trudeau will take part in a student assembly at an Ottawa high school Thursday afternoon followed by a dinner at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que. Mr. Ban will then head to Montreal on Friday, where he will meet Mayor Denis Coderre, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard and members of the International Civil Aviation Organization. He will also deliver an address at McGill University.",N/A,N/A,Globe and Mail,02-11-2016,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/un-secretary-general-welcomes-very-warm-relations-with-canada/article28719418/,02-11-2016
0,Dennis Oland sentenced to life in prison for father's murder,"Dennis Oland has been sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 10 years for the second-degree murder of his father.

Oland’s lawyer pleaded Thursday that the judge consider his client’s children in setting the sentence.

Defence lawyer Gary Miller provided Justice John Walsh with character references from Oland’s family saying he was needed and loved and is a good caregiver. He said the case doesn’t require more than the minimum of 10 years before parole eligibility.

“I beg your lordship, give him the kind of sentence that allows him to get home to his family as soon as possible,” said Miller during the hearing in the Saint John courtroom.

Oland declined an offer from the judge to offer his own comments earlier in the day.

Before handing down the sentence, Walsh said a pre-sentence report described Oland as a well-educated, 47-year-old man with no previous criminal record. He also said Oland told a parole officer that he can’t feel remorse because he is innocent.

“This was a family tragedy of Shakespearean proportions,” Walsh said.

A jury found Oland guilty of Richard Oland’s murder in December following a trial that lasted four months and captured widespread public attention.

A conviction on second-degree murder carries a life sentence with a range of parole eligibility set between 10 and 25 years. All 12 jurors recommended that Oland have no chance of parole for 10 years.

But Crown lawyer Patrick Wilbur said the brutal nature of the elder Oland’s death called for a sentence more than the minimum 10 years required under the law. He called for between 12 and 15 years in jail before parole eligibility.

Richard Oland’s body was found face down in a pool of blood in his Saint John office on July 7, 2011. He had suffered 45 blunt and sharp force blows to his head, neck and hands, although no weapon was ever found.

Sheriffs had to turn most supporters away from attending Thursday’s hearing after a lineup formed in front of the courthouse before the sentencing.

However, members of the Oland family were seated in the front row of the hearing and close 100 people were crammed into the rows behind.

Walsh was given 73 character reference letters, 10 of which the Crown objected to, during the morning hearing.

The judge told the defence lawyers it was offensive that some of the character references used their letters as Trojan horses to give their personal opinions on the case.

“It’s upsetting to me as a judge that people would do that,” Walsh said, adding the only opinions that count were those of the jury.

“I am not pleased.”

After a break, defence lawyers withdrew seven of the letters, and redacted three more to remove opinions about the verdict. Walsh also placed a provisional publication ban on four letters from Oland’s children.

“I’m concerned about their privacy,” he said.

Oland was dressed in the same brown suit and blue shirt he wore through much of the trial, and he smiled at family and supporters as he entered the courtroom.

After his conviction, Oland’s mother Connie said in statement the family was shocked by the outcome.

An appeal of the conviction has since been filed but no date has been set. A bail hearing will be held Friday in Fredericton as Oland’s lawyers seek his release pending the hearing of the appeal.

The Olands are an establishment family in the history of the Maritimes, having founded Moosehead Breweries although Richard Oland left the family business in 1981.

During the trial, the Crown focused on possible issues of motive including Dennis Oland’s financial difficulties and the knowledge his father was having an affair.

The key piece of evidence for the Crown was a brown jacket worn by Dennis Oland that had a number of small blood stains and also DNA that matched the profile of Richard Oland.

Oland has repeatedly denied any involvement in his father’s death.",N/A,N/A,Globe and Mail,02-11-2016,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/dennis-oland-sentenced-to-life/article28713165/,02-11-2016
0,B.C.’s house-flipping practices setting off alarm bells in Ontario,"Ontario’s real estate regulator says it is considering warning agents to play by the rules when it comes to flipping houses, after British Columbia’s move to clamp down on the controversial, but legal, practice of selling assignments.

The Real Estate Council of Ontario, the self-governing body that regulates the province’s real estate industry, says it doesn’t believe the practice of assignment flipping is widespread in Ontario. However, it is closely watching developments in B.C., where regulators have promised an investigation into concerns some agents are not properly disclosing their financial interests in a sale.

“The reporting out of B.C. certainly has been pushed to the front burner of our attention and we’re certainly monitoring what’s going on,” said Kelvin Kucey, deputy registrar of regulatory compliance for Ontario’s real estate council.

Ontario’s regulator is considering issuing a registrar’s bulletin, a formal notice to industry members, reminding them that agents must disclose their interests in a prospective sale to everyone involved in the transaction, along with disclosing any information that could potentially affect the value of the property.

Mr. Kucey said the council also wanted to encourage sellers to do their due diligence if they’re approached by an agent offering to buy their home, which includes making sure they’re getting the best price.

“If this is a concern as a seller that somebody may be buying the property at a lower price than what you think, maybe you need to ask some more questions with regards to what the basis of the market analysis is and then don’t stop at the first analysis that you get,” he said.

The Ontario industry’s reaction comes after a Globe and Mail investigation revealed some agents in B.C. have reaped massive profits through a practice known as a contract assignment, which involves arranging a sale and then finding a new buyer willing to pay more before the deal closes, in essence “assign-ing.”

The revelations triggered a swift reaction from B.C. Premier Christy Clark, who said the province was prepared to take more control over the real estate brokerage sector if it did not immediately move to discourage the technique.

In Ontario, as in B.C., there are no reliable data on assignments. The practice is legal and some argue it is an important element of the housing industry that allows buyers to get out of a costly deal if their personal circumstances suddenly change.

However, several provinces require Realtors to get the consent of the seller in advance before assigning a deal to a new buyer.

Ontario’s real estate council received 11 complaints last year about improper disclosure by Realtors, but said most involved minor paper-work issues, not “malicious intent.”

“The assignment aspect really hasn’t crystallized in Ontario on a complaint basis,” Mr. Kucey said. “But obviously we’re monitoring what’s going on in British Columbia and if we have complaints where this is actually taking place in Ontario, we will investigate. And if the evidence is there, we’ll certainly prosecute any Realtor who is not abiding by the rules and regulations.”

Assignments were never a major issue in Alberta even during the province’s real estate-boom years and have become less of a concern in the current soft market, said Natalie Scollard of the Real Estate Council of Alberta. “This is the type of thing you would be more likely to see in a rising, escalating market, which Alberta is not right now,” she said.

The province banned so called “dual agency,” where Realtors can represent both a seller and a buyer, in 2008. It was replaced with something called a transaction brokerage, where a realtor can help both sides do a deal, but can’t act on behalf of either party and must keep details of both confidential.

In Toronto, where fierce bidding wars have broken out for detached homes and prices of some properties have soared at double-digit annual rates, Realtors say they have yet to see widespread evidence of the issues facing Vancouver’s market, where Realtors have been able to flip properties in a matter of days or weeks at a massive markup. The Toronto Real Estate Board issued a statement saying it was “not aware of any concerns” about assignment flipping.

“We haven’t come across it a lot yet in the city,” said Adam Brind, broker at Core Assets Inc. in downtown Toronto. “But that doesn’t mean that maybe we won’t start to see it if prices and demand keep growing in Toronto.”

In some cases, prospective buyers have lost out on a bidding war and have approached the winning buyer about reselling the property at a higher price. Mr. Brind saw one deal in which a losing bidder offered the successful buyers an extra $100,000 to purchase a property only days after they had bought it.

Toronto was once home to an active assignment market for preconstruction condos, in which investors bought units at a discount years before a building was constructed and then sold the assignment rights to speculators hoping to cash in on future price increases, often paying fees to a developer for the privilege. The practice has slowed in recent years as developers realized they could price their preconstruction units higher and keep those profits for themselves.",N/A,N/A,Globe and Mail,02-10-2016,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/housing/bcs-house-flipping-practices-setting-off-alarm-bells-in-ontario/article28711928/,02-11-2016
0,"Sharing of nursing home rooms saves dollars in B.C., but at what cost?","Ideally, every senior living in a publicly funded nursing home in B.C. would have their own bedroom but there are 820 seniors sharing a room with two to four other people and 2,000 seniors in double rooms, says B.C.’s seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie.

The Ministry of Health’s target is to have 95 per cent of seniors in B.C.’s 331 long-term care facilities to have their own bedroom and bathroom. Currently, 75 percent of residential care beds are in single rooms.

“It’s cold comfort if you are ... in a four-bed ward instead of your own room,” said Mackenzie. “Everybody should have their own bed and own bathroom.”

Marie Morris’s mother Rosa Pellizzari, 94, was recently placed in a four-person room. She shared a small space with three other seniors with only curtains hanging between the beds for privacy.

The family was told if they didn’t take the bed at the Willingdon Care Centre in Burnaby, Pellizzari would be taken off the waiting list for long-term residential care. Willingdon Care Centre has a contract with the Fraser Healthy Authority, and is a privately owned facility with 95 seniors living in rooms housing two to four seniors. The facility has 10 single rooms.

“I had no options in placing my mother in this awful place. All health authorities have a policy that the first available bed must be accepted. As a family member I felt railroaded and feel that my mother was held hostage,” said Morris.

“The bed spaces were smaller than what you would get in a hospital today. We tried to personalize the space, but it was impossible.”

Morris said it’s unethical for the government to force seniors into such crowded quarters.

A Ministry of Health Statement reads in part: “The ministry understands single occupancy rooms are ideal and we are committed to creating a baseline inventory to track and monitor progress on the number of single occupancy rooms renovated and built.”

Since 2000, all newly licensed residential care facilities under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act have been required to provide private bedrooms to residents.

“New facilities licensed since that time have been permitted to house up to five per cent of residents in double occupancy rooms, as long as certain conditions are met. This helps to allow for flexibility, and also helps to accommodate couples, for example.”

There are no immediate plans to upgrade Willingdon Care Centre, nor a fixed timeline to redevelop any of the 11 other facilities where three or more seniors share a room, said Tasleem Juma of Fraser Health.

Under the Hospital Act, facilities in 2000 were “grandfathered” to allow for multi-occupancy rooms. In Fraser Health, for instance, Queens Park Care Centre has 32 rooms of three or more seniors sharing a room while Willingdon Care Centre has 10 such rooms.

“All of our new residential care facilities, including the 403 beds scheduled to open this spring, follow the legislated guidelines related to (single room) occupancy,” said Juma.

Morris said it isn’t right that older facilities are allowed to operate under different rules.

“It is amazing to me that we put frail seniors into such horrible environments that do not come close to meeting the standards outlined in the Residential Care Act,” she said.

Morris said she considered Willingdon Care “overcrowded” and witnessed lots of frustration among its residents.

“I wonder if that is one of the causes of seniors lashing out against one another or against the care providers,” she said.

Mackenzie said her office is conducting a systemic review of resident-on-resident aggression in B.C. nursing homes, and it could end up showing seniors living in multi-resident rooms have a higher incidence of resident on resident aggression.

“I think that those of us who have worked in the field all know significant agitation can arise by sharing a room. It’s common sense,” said Mackenzie.

Last year, there were more than 1,000 resident-on-resident assaults in B.C. nursing homes. Approximately 550 resulted in a senior requiring first aid or hospitalization. There have also been 16 deaths of seniors — mostly caused by other seniors with dementia — in the past four years in B.C.

“With a dementia population, certain triggers can ignite outbursts of aggression, and for those sharing a room there’s no possibility to escape that,” said Mackenzie. “To me one of the solutions is they get their own room and bathroom. That should be the base level.”

Morris said as soon as her mother was placed at Willingdon, she lobbied to move her. After 10 days, Pellizzari was moved to a single room in Normanna Rest Home in Burnaby.

“The difference is like night and day.”

According to the Office of the Seniors Advocate, there are 44 facilities in B.C. that have rooms with three to five people sharing the space.

The BC Care Providers Association agrees rooms for three to five seniors should be phased out but still see a role for some double rooms. The organization, which represents care providers who supply over 60 per cent of the publicly funded beds in B.C., believes it’s financially unsustainable to have 95 per cent of all residents in single occupancy rooms.

“A facility with 100 beds that must have at least 95 per cent of the rooms as single rooms would cost a minimum of $24,500,000 to build. If, instead, 75 per of the beds were single rooms, a facility with 100 beds would cost $22,250,000 to build. This is a savings of $2,250,000 in construction costs per care home, or a savings of almost 10 per cent of current construction costs,” the report states. “These substantially lower construction costs would make operating a private care home in B.C. more sustainable in the long-run.”

The association’s CEO Daniel Fontaine said the industry is moving away from homes that have quad rooms, and as older nursing homes are replaced they are building facilities where most rooms are singles.

But, he added, many of his association’s members who represent 145 of the 331 long term care facilities in the province already have empty beds in single rooms that could accommodate seniors living in multiple-resident rooms now. Members in Fraser Health, for instance, have 1,000 beds set aside for private clients but 100 of these stand empty.

“If the Ministry of Health has it as a priority (for seniors in nursing homes to be in single rooms) I’m willing to sit at a table tomorrow with them to discuss a plan,” he said. “A lot of this comes down to dollars and secondly to logistics. It’s not something we’ve had a large discussion with them about existing capacity within care.”",N/A,N/A,Vancouver Sun,02-10-2016,http://www.vancouversun.com/news/sharing+nursing+home+rooms+saves+dollars+what+cost/11711437/story.html,02-11-2016
0,Syphilis rate reaches 30-year high in B.C.,"VANCOUVER — Health officials in Vancouver say the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 2015 compared with a decade ago, and are launching a formal outbreak response to deal with the situation.

Vancouver Coastal Health says rates of the infectious sexually transmitted disease are at their highest in 30 years in B.C., and predominantly affect gay men.

Last year, nearly 500 cases of syphilis were reported in Vancouver Coastal Health, more than double the yearly cases reported a decade ago, according to Dr. Réka Gustafson, medical health officer with VCH.

By calling an outbreak response, VCH says it is stepping up its efforts by working directly with physicians and community groups to increase testing and promote awareness of the steps everyone can take to prevent, diagnose and treat syphilis.

VCH is collaborating with Positive Living BC, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), YouthCO and Health Initiative for Men (HIM) to create a marketing campaign featuring gay sex-positive imagery.

The campaign launches Feb, 14, and includes posters, a webpage (www.checkhimout.ca/syphilis), transit ads, and ads in newspapers and on dating websites.

VCH says 97 per cent of syphilis diagnoses are male and over 90 per cent identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. While syphilis rates have increased in all age groups, the largest increase is among 20 to 24-year-olds, marking a shift to younger men.

VCH and the BCCDC recommend that men who have sex with men get tested every three to six months, and visit their health care provider if they have sores, bumps, a rash, blisters or warts on or around their genitals or anal area. Using condoms is also recommended.",N/A,N/A,Vancouver Sun,02-11-2016,http://www.vancouversun.com/news/metro/syphilis+rate+reaches+year+high/11713386/story.html,02-11-2016

","MONTERREY, Mexico — Fifty-two inmates were killed and 12 injured in a brutal fight between two rival factions at a prison in northern Mexico on Thursday, the state governor said.

Nuevo Leon Gov. Jaime Rodriguez told a news conference the fight involved a faction led by a member of the infamous Zetas drug cartel.

Rescue workers could be seen bringing injured inmates from the Topo Chico prison in Monterrey, at least some with burns.

The riot broke out just six days before Pope Francis is scheduled to visit another Mexican prison, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua state.

Images broadcast by Milenio Television showed flames leaping from the prison, with a crowd of people bundled against the cold gathered outside the prison. Some shook and kicked at the prison gates, demanding to be allowed in.

The fire appeared to have been extinguished by shortly after sunrise.

Witnesses said the fire broke out at about 12:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EST) amid shouts and sounds of explosions. A thick cloud of smoke rose, apparently from inmates burning mattresses.

Mexico’s official National Human Rights Commission reported in 2013 that the country’s prison system is plagued by violence and cases of inmate control, symptoms of corruption and lack of resources.

The report, based on visits and interviews at 101 of Mexico’s most populated prisons, found that 65 of the facilities were run by inmates, not authorities.

In one of the worst incidents in 25 years, 44 inmates died in a prison massacre in February 2012 in Apodaca, Nuevo Leon. After the incident, three top prison officials and 26 guards were accused of helping inmates escape in the confusion. The governor of Nuevo Leon state says 52 inmates were killed and 12 injured in a brutal fight between two rival factions Thursday at a prison in northern Mexico.",N/A,N/A,Vancouver Sun,02-11-2016,http://www.vancouversun.com/news/world/fifty+dead+brutal+prison+riot+northern+mexico+drug+cartel/11712981/story.html,02-11-2016
0,"Alex Edler, Brandon Sutter injuries make it a tougher mountain for Canucks to climb","GLENDALE, Ariz. — Willie Desjardins did not even try to sugar-coat the loss of defenceman Alex Edler and centre Brandon Sutter.

“It does make it a much bigger challenge,” the Vancouver Canucks coach said before his team played the Arizona Coyotes on Wednesday night.

That may be an understatement.

Sutter and Edler were sent home Wednesday after suffering injuries in the second period of Tuesday night’s 3-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche. Sutter has a broken jaw, Edler a fractured fibula.

They won’t be back any time soon and Desjardins did not try and pretend that the loss of the two veterans won’t hurt.

“They are difficult injuries in all facets of our game,” Desjardins said. “Right-handed draw man, two guys who are on the first unit (power play). They are big losses.”

They come, of course, at the worst possible time for the Canucks, who had finally got completely healthy. Desjardins said he had a good feeling about his team heading into this two-game road trip and shared his optimism with his players before Tuesday night’s game in Denver.

“Coming into the Colorado game I said, guys, it’s all set for us to start playing good. The guys that were injured had played a couple of games. . .now everybody is back, we’ve had a couple of games, so there’s no reason we don’t start playing the way we can play. That is how I felt. I think the team was excited, the team felt that way.

“Even though we had lost a few, we had played pretty good in those games, we were confident that we were still there in the hunt. Now it’s a matter of finding a way again. You have to battle and you have to stay in it until you come back and get healthy again.”

Desjardins had to make a couple of lineup changes on Wednesday night and one of them figured to be controversial, but was changed before the game when Derek Dorsett was unable to play due to an illness.

As expected, Alex Biega, a healthy scratch for the last two games, stepped in for Edler. But Desjardins’ initial plan was to play Adam Cracknell instead of rookie Jared McCann. That would have been three straight games for McCann as a healthy scratch.

Desjardins said before the game he feared a possible match up against Coyotes centre Martin Hanzal.

“If he gets matched up against Hanzal, that’s a tough matchup for a guy,” Desjardins said. “Hanzal is a big boy. It is going to happen, but I think it’s probably a better matchup at home.”

McCann was inserted into the lineup when Dorsett was unable to play.

Desjardins acknowledged that he will be second-guessed for some of his lineup decisions in the weeks to come. He also said he sometimes second-guesses himself when decisions he makes don’t result in a win.

“There will be second-guessing,” he said. “There are different ways to do it. It’s not like it’s a 90-10 decision, they are not clear cut. They are 50-50 or 60-40, so 40 per cent of the people are going to think you are wrong one way or the other. It’s trying to do what is best for the player and best for the team.

“That is the call. You can go either way and after the game, if you lose, well, you should have gone the other way. I am the first to say, well, that wasn’t the way to go. If you lose, you wished you would have tried something else. But that is the way we are going to go tonight.”

Sutter was playing in just his fourth game after missing 33 games following sports hernia surgery.

“That was just tough luck, it goes off a guy’s skate and bounces the other way and then hits him in the jaw,” Vancouver GM Jim Benning said. “That’s just bad luck. I don’t know what else you can say about it. He has got a visor on and it just hits underneath his visor and hits him in the jaw. He is a good player and we’ll miss him, but we are going to have to figure it out.”

0,Federal immigration minister says Calgary could take more Syrian refugees,"Immigration Minister John McCallum says Calgary could be asked to take in more Syrian refugees given the city’s relative success in resettling people fleeing the war-torn region.

McCallum was in the city Thursday for the announcement of $600,000 in funding to the Calgary Catholic Immigration Society from the private sector-sponsored Welcome Fund for Syrian Refugees.

About 900 Syrian refugees have come to Calgary so far, with just over 100 remaining in hotels or the Margaret Chisholm Resettlement Centre.

Calgary is expected to take about 1,200-1,300 refugees out of the approximately 3,000 the Alberta government has said it will accept. The federal Liberal government has promised to bring in 25,000 in total, though it missed its initial year-end deadline.

Fairborz Birjandian, CEO of the Catholic Immigration Society, said that if the federal and provincial government decide to send more refugees to Calgary they can be accommodated.

McCallum said the city had done a “fantastic job” in accepting refugees.

“I know that Calgary is doing extremely well,” said McCallum, the minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.

“Our objective is to settle all of the 25,000 as positively and comfortably and effectively as we can and from what I’ve just heard, I think Calgary could take a few more.” 

The money announced Tuesday from the Welcome Fund, which is backstopped by Manulife, CN and GM, will be used for housing by helping to subsidize rent for accommodations.",N/A,N/A,Calgary Herald,02-11-2016,http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/federal-immigration-minister-says-calgary-could-take-more-syrian-refugees,02-11-2016
0,Conservatives spent 53 cents on ads for every dollar they spent to run an apprenticeship loan program,"OTTAWA — A new report shows that for every dollar the Conservative government budgeted for its marquee job-training program, it spent 53 cents advertising it in the first year.

Newly released details of the previous government’s 2014-15 advertising budget show that spending on ads linked to the economic action plan outpaced any other campaign.

The TV, radio, Internet and print ads for the Canada apprentice loan program came in at $6.7 million, one of the Ottawa’s most expensive campaigns.

The loan program, first announced in the 2014 budget, was estimated to cost $12.6 million annually in the first two years.

But government forecasts pegged the overall cost of the program at $7.4 million a year over a decade — meaning the first year of advertising might have wound up costing nearly as much as the net cost of a single year of loans.

The NDP complained to the Advertising Standards Canada about the ads in early 2015, arguing they were misleading.

The TV voiceover said that over “the next decade, one million skilled tradesmen and women will be needed to keep Canada’s growing economy strong.”

The New Democrats argued the number was not supported by any independent statistics or estimates.

Other ads about the Conservative government’s economic action plan cost $8.1 million in 2014-15. Opposition critics argued the government was spending taxpayers’ money on ads that were closely linked to the party brand.

Other big-ticket ad buys included $8.6 million on military recruitment and $7.1 million on anti-drug spots.

The Liberals promised during the election to ban “partisan” government ads, and pledged to appoint an advertising commissioner to review proposed campaigns.",N/A,N/A,Calgary Herald,02-10-2016,http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/national/conservatives+spent+cents+every+dollar+they+spent+apprenticeship/11712755/story.html,02-11-2016
0,"Cenovus plans more job cuts, spending reductions for coming year","Cenovus Energy Inc. slashed its dividend by 69 per cent and said it will cut more jobs and further reduce its 2016 spending in an effort to maintain cash amid an extended slide in oil and natural gas prices.

The company said in a statement Thursday it will cut jobs and defer non-essential maintenance, including a turnaround at its Foster Creek oilsands site that will be pushed to 2017. Capital spending will drop to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from a December forecast of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, while the quarterly payout will sink to five cents from 16 cents.

Cenovus announced the cuts in a statement on Thursday as it posted a loss of $641 million, or 77 cents a share in the quarter, compared with a loss of $472 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier.

“We must remain focused on maintaining our financial resilience through 2016 and beyond, ensuring that we don’t compromise the balance sheet strength we’ve worked so hard to achieve, so that we are well placed to maximize shareholder value when commodity prices improve,” chief executive Brian Ferguson said in the statement.

The planned capital spending reductions at the Foster Creek and Christina Lake sites are expected to have minimal impact on the company’s oilsands production for 2016, the company said in the statement.

Cenovus almost doubled oil and liquids production to 210,000 barrels a day late last year from 107,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2009. That growth was part of an earlier strategy that aimed to raise production to almost half a million barrels a day by 2021.

In addition to cutting jobs, the company will evaluate its staffing costs, including reassessing benefits, allowances and contractor rates, Cenovus said in its statement. Cash compensation for Ferguson and the company’s four other highest paid executives was cut in 2015 and will be cut again this year, it said.

In all, Cenovus said its workforce measures would account for around $80 million in savings — roughly 40 per cent of a program to reduce operating, general and administrative costs by $200 million.

Western Canada Select, the blend of heavy crude produced from oil sands bitumen, averaged $27.82 in the fourth quarter, compared with an average of $65.75 over the past five years.

0,Ontario man with memory loss believed missing or dead for 30 years suddenly recalls his identity,"An Ontario man who disappeared three decades ago and was believed dead is about to be reunited with his family.

Niagara Regional Police say Edgar Latulip was reported missing in 1986 from Waterloo region.

Const. Phil Gavin says Latulip took a bus to the Niagara region, where he suffered a head injury that robbed him of much of his memory.

Gavin says Latulip went on to live in the area for the next 30 years, but recently began having memory flashes that made him believe he was living under the wrong name.

Latulip shared his concerns with a social worker, who Googled his name and discovered that he was the subject of a long-standing missing person’s investigation.

Gavin says Latulip’s identity has now been confirmed through a DNA test and police are preparing to help him make contact with his surviving relatives.

“I don’t think anyone that I’ve spoken to has heard of a case like this other than a story made for TV,” Gavin said.

I don’t think anyone that I’ve spoken to has heard of a case like this other than a story made for TV

According to a profile in the Waterloo Region Record, Latulip was living in a local group home at the time of his disappearance. The profile said he was developmentally delayed and functioned at the cognitive level of a child.

Latulip had made suicide attempts in the past, and family members feared he had travelled to Niagara Falls for another attempt when he vanished in 1986.

The mystery surrounding his disappearance took its toll on Latulip’s mother, according to the newspaper profile.

“This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,” Silvia Wilson told the Record. “When Edgar disappeared, I became quite sick. I had to take a leave of absence from work. I was near a nervous breakdown.”

This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure

Gavin, who said he could not comment on Latulip’s life prior to his disappearance, said he did in fact make it to the Falls before travelling to nearby St. Catharines.

Gavin said it’s unknown how or when Latulip received his head injury, nor when his memory began to return.

The first evidence of those recollections came in January when Latulip revealed suspicions of his past identity to a local social worker.

A Google search turned up the newspaper profile, prompting her to reach out to police.

Gavin said the results of Latulip’s DNA test came back on Monday, leaving the 50-year-old with much to process.

“He’s got a lot to take in to remember his old identity,” he said. “There’s nerves. You haven’t seen your family members in all these years and now a reunification process. I think it’s a lot to take in.”",N/A,N/A,Calgary Herald,02-10-2016,http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/ontario+with+memory+loss+believed+missing+dead+years+suddenly/11713258/story.html,02-11-2016

0,Christie Blatchford: The Ghomeshi sex-assault case started falling apart right from the start,"In the magnificent words of the Tragically Hip, in their 1989 Boots or Hearts song, when it starts to fall apart, man, it really falls apart.

At the just-concluded sexual assault trial of the fallen CBC star Jian Ghomeshi, prosecutors Mike Callaghan and Corie Langdon didn’t have long to wait.

Their first unpleasant surprise came on opening day last week with the first of three female accusers in the witness stand in a Toronto courtroom — she was and is still considered their strongest complainant and is certainly the least discredited — but it sure didn’t stop there.

Complainant No. 2, Trailer Park Boys actor and Royal Canadian Air Force captain Lucy DeCoutere, who waived the mandatory publication ban on her identity and thus became the face and symbol of Ghomeshi’s accusers, was next.

Despite protestations she had no romantic or sexual interest in Ghomeshi after her purported assault — “I guarantee you that,” she told his lead lawyer, the formidable Marie Henein — it turned out she had all but stalked the 48-year-old former star — all this after he’d allegedly choked and slapped her hard in the face — and had told him in an email she wanted to “f— your brains out.”

A few days later, DeCoutere wrote him an old-school love letter that ended with the line “I love your hands.”

Incredibly, the last complainant flamed out even more spectacularly as Henein got her to acknowledge she’d told lies, omitted details and deliberately misled police and prosecutors and then confronted her with the fact that after the alleged attack, she had taken Ghomeshi home with her one night and, as the lawyer so inimitably put it, “messed around and gave him a hand job.”

The latter two accusers — the former Q host is pleading not guilty to four sex assault charges and one of choking DeCoutere — made 11th-hour disclosures of some of these details only on the eve of their taking the witness stand. The disclosures came so late they sandbagged prosecutors and left them unable to combat them.

But though these developments caused actual gasps in the crowded Old City Hall courtroom and had lawyers the city over reeling in disbelief at the havoc unfolding in courtroom No. 125, the die had been cast long before that.

As one veteran Toronto lawyer put it this week, “the criminal justice system has been hijacked by ideology,” in this instance, the feminist chant that accusers must always be believed.

The Ghomeshi prosecution was born in the late fall/early winter of 2014 in the same maelstrom that saw Bill Cosby first called out as a rapist, the Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women movement find wind under its social media wings, two Liberal MPs in Ottawa kicked out of caucus with shredded reputations after vague and anonymous allegations from New Democrat MPs and a developing “national conversation” about sexual assault and harassment and the barriers to reporting it.

The prosecution originally, floridly unfolded in the pages of one of the country’s biggest newspaper, the Toronto Star, which first published allegations against Ghomeshi by what were then three anonymous women, and then on social media through Twitter hashtags such as #IBelieveLucy, #BeenRapedNeverReported (started in support of the Ghomeshi accusers, it grew like wildfire) and the more generic #IBelieveThem.

This publicity alone spelled trouble enough for the complainants in court.

The alleged victims reported to Toronto Police only after they had been well-interviewed — in DeCoutere’s case, nine times — in the pages of the Star and other newspapers and on air at the CBC and other stations.

While that may have been empowering for the women, it meant their versions of what happened were well on the public record already — and that meant any inconsistencies or differences between what they told the media and what they told police were there for the getting by the defence team.

Witness credibility always matters in court, but particularly in sex assault cases, where almost by definition other witnesses are scarce, and especially with historic or dated allegations like these, where the events took place in 2002 and 2003 and any potential forensic evidence is long lost.

Additionally, DeCoutere and the third complainant quickly bonded as online friends over Ghomeshi, and in less than a year from Oct. 29, 2014 to Sept. 23 last year, the two women exchanged more than 5,000 Facebook messages.

(The first complainant was not similarly tainted.)

That raised the spectre of witness collusion, and certainly, with the two women regularly reporting in to one another when they met with detectives or prosecutors, tracking Ghomeshi’s every court appearance and gleefully savouring his fall from grace, it was at least damaging.

It was particularly galling in DeCoutere’s case, for in the same period that she was nodding her head sorrowfully in TV interviews about Ghomeshi’s situation and professing compassion for him, she was telling her newfound Facebook friend, “I want him f—ing decimated.”

There was, in other words, a lynching in the collective air.

For a time, it appeared as though anyone who had ever had a date with Ghomeshi, good or bad, felt the need to go online and “share” it — and months where his name appeared far more often in major Canadian news outlet headlines than Cosby’s.

It was reminiscent of the curious child abuse/satanic ritual/predator ring cases that seemed to sweep across North America in the 1980s and early 1990s — notorious among them the McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where allegations grew ever wilder as 384 youngsters were identified as having been sexually abused; the Little Rascals day care in Edenton, N.C., which saw the allegedly victimized children name a total of 30 abusers, and, closer to home, the historic child abuse allegations in Cornwall, Ont., which eventually grew to become claims that “a clan of pedophiles” of prominent local citizens was operating in town.

What those cases have in common is that, for a time, suspicion itself appeared downright contagious, and the procedure for interviewing ostensible victims was deeply flawed.

What happened in the Ghomeshi case isn’t the same, of course, but there are echoes enough to be troubling.

As the allegations against Ghomeshi in the media and online grew, the pressure mounted on the police: Why did none of these women feel “safe” reporting to them?

Four days after the CBC fired Ghomeshi and the Star published its first story on the scandal, then-chief Bill Blair encouraged women to report.

“Our first priority is their safety,” he said of the alleged victims, “and their recovery.”

It was an astonishing remark for the head of an agency whose primary function, many would have imagined, was to investigate allegations of crime, not comfort those reporting it.

Yet two days later, Inspector Joanna Beaven-Desjardins, commander of the force’s sex crimes unit, held a press conference to announce that three women had come forward with allegations against Ghomeshi.

In a question-and-answer session afterwards, speaking generally, Beaven-Desjardins said repeatedly that “We believe victims when they come in, 100%, we are behind them 100%,” and “We believe them right from the onset, there’s never a doubt about believing them” and “it’s all about the victims and moving them forward.”

The three Ghomeshi accusers all duly pronounced themselves satisfied by their treatment at the hands of police. All said they felt “safe” and respected.

The results of the investigation itself are less clear.

But what did emerge about the probe at trial isn’t encouraging.

The first complainant, for instance, was interviewed once, a process that took less than an hour and which, after time deducted for various standard cautions, saw the woman “tell her story” for 14 minutes, and detectives question her for a grand total of 35 minutes.

And when the third complainant arranged to give her late-in-the-day second statement, and told the officers what it was about — that “little detail” about her taking Ghomeshi home and masturbating him — the detectives spent only nine minutes asking her about the encounter, nine minutes after 13 months of the woman steadfastly maintaining she’d kept her distance from Ghomeshi after the alleged assault.

Strangely, given the remarkable nature of the disclosure, the interview wasn’t recorded.

This isn’t the first time the practices of the sex assault unit and Beaven-Desjardins have been criticized.

Late last month, lawyer Brian Greenspan said that against the clear advice of senior prosecutors, whom unusually in this instance were consulted by police, the unit last fall laid a sex assault charge it knew would fail against prominent Brazilian soccer star Lucas Domingues Piazon and smeared him as a rapist at a press conference.

The charge was withdrawn Jan. 26.
Justice William Horkins, defence lawyer Marie Henein, the third complainant and Crown attorney Michael Callaghan appear at Ghomeshi's sexual assault trial in Toronto, Monday, Feb.8, 2016.
Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner and Britain’s senior law enforcement officer, wrote in The Guardian this week that it may be time for Britain to consider dropping its policy of automatically believing those who claim they have been sexually abused.

The policy was embraced in 2014, of course, the year the presumption of guilt, not innocence, took hold the planet over.

“A good investigator,” he wrote, “would go and test the accuracy of the allegations and the evidence with an open mind…”

Test the evidence, an open mind: who could have imagined these would ever be deemed revolutionary concepts for a police force?

When a jury was deadlocked in the trial of one of the chief alleged villains in the McMartin Preschool scandal, several hundred people took to the streets in protest. They carried signs that read “We believe the children.”

And on the very days when DeCoutere and the third complainant were being most roundly discredited inside Old City Hall, there were still protesters on the steps outside, with signs that read #believeallsurvivors and #IBELIEVE HER.

They might just as well have been covering their eyes and ears, blinder than any statue of Themis, the goddess of justice.

The judge will deliver his verdict on March 24.

0,‘Can I get a tax receipt?’: Tax confusion muddles Syrian refugee sponsorship efforts,"As the Toronto office of Lifeline Syria scrambles to accommodate thousands of refugees, the question the charity’s chair Ratna Omidvar and her team hears most often is: “Can I get a tax receipt?”

In many cases, the answer is no.

Canada has so far welcomed more than 13,500 refugees since the Liberal government’s program began last November. Of that total, close to 5,000 have been supported by private sponsors.

Refugee support initiatives such as Lifeline Syria say allowing donors to receive a tax receipt when they are donating to a registered charity and suggesting a particular family to receive support would encourage more donations, ease the government’s burden and make integration easier. Currently, charities can issue tax receipts to donors who indicate they’d like their donation applied to a specific area of interest, such as refugees, but not when the donation is directed to a particular family.

“The more Canadians step up and promote charities, the less the government is going to have to do these things,” says Estelle Duez, a tax lawyer at LaBarge Weinstein in Ottawa.

“As Canadians, we are used to the notion that when we make a charitable donation, (we) will get some kind of tax relief,” says Paul Clarke, executive director of Action Réfugiés Montréal. He says despite the extraordinary support Canadians have shown for Syrian refugees to date, questions around tax deductibility dissuade some people from sponsorship.

Mark Blumberg, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in non-profit and charity law, says the Canada Revenue Agency could make donating and sponsoring easier by clarifying the rules. Although money given to a registered refugee charity is normally tax deductible, Blumberg says the situation becomes more tricky when a donor instructs the money should go to a specific person or family, sometimes referred to as a “general direction” or “directed gift.”

The CRA’s position is that “All decisions regarding use of the donation must rest with the charity.” In other words: it cannot issue a tax receipt if a donor wants the charity to give the funds to a specified person or family, because “such a gift is made to the person or family and not to the charity.”

Exceptions add to the confusion. For example, a “general direction” to use the gift for a “particular program” is acceptable, provided “no benefit accrues to the donor” and the gift “does not benefit any person not dealing at arms’ length with the donor.”

If the CRA provided greater leeway, “there’d be more people making donations,” says Blumberg. He cites the partial receipting of tuition costs at religious day schools.

Another problem, according to Blumberg, is that so-called Groups of Five, known as G5s, cannot issue tax receipts to supporters because they are not registered charities.

Immigration and citizenship defines G5s as five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents with the financial means to be a sponsor, the ability to provide emotional and social support and living in the refugee’s expected community. Due to privacy reasons, only the CRA knows who they are, says lawyer Duez. “I doubt anyone has a clear idea of how many refugees have been sponsored by G5s to date.”

Moreover, G5s may be unable to receive tax receipts when they make a donation to a registered charity to help the family they are sponsoring. “Groups of Five are the most generous but are treated the worst,” says Blumberg. The estimated total annual settlement cost for one refugee is $12,600, which does not include in-kind expenses, such as shelter, clothing and furniture.

If a G5 partners with an organization able to issue tax receipts, it can collect more donations. The Canadian Council for Refugees’ executive director Janet Dench says her charity has been contacted by G5s wanting to do just that. “If they do (get a tax receipt), people are more inclined to give larger amounts,” says Dench.

Another barrier for G5s is that they generally include Canadian members of the refugee’s family. “Any donations made by the family would be excluded from a charitable receipt because the recipient would not be at arm’s length from the donor,” says Donald Smith, chair of the Refugee Working Group at the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa.

That’s why many community groups are looking to sponsor refugees in partnership with the holder of a sponsorship agreement with Ottawa. Once associated with a sponsorship agreement holder (SAH), these community groups become constituent groups (CGs), allowing them to sponsor one or more refugees with the SAH’s support.

CGs are based in the sponsored refugee’s expected community of settlement and, unlike G5s, must have their sponsorship application and settlement plan approved by a SAH.

However, a group depending on a partnership with a SAH because it does not have the financial means to form a Group of Five may not meet those criteria. And organizations cannot take on a project unless it fits their core mandate as they are responsible for the use of funds for which they issue tax receipts. Says Dench: “Organizations have to be careful about issuing charitable receipts for groups they partner with.” Moreover, a SAH might not have the resources to partner with the group. “The administrative burden can be quite a lot,” says Dench.

The third class of sponsors are Community Sponsors, which can be organizations, associations or corporations. If it is a registered charity, and if refugee sponsorship is a part of its mission or mandate, the Community Sponsor can issue a charitable receipt.

Smith’s experience at the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa is a cautionary tale. Since last August, the number of constituent groups under the diocese’s wing has jumped from 11 to 50. Smith describes all the new sign-ons as “inexperienced.”

“Like everyone else in the sponsorship community I’ve been working seven days a week,” he says.

The advantageous nature of partnerships with SAHs is leading to overworked charities and non-profits, and many of those in the field say that’s creating bottlenecks in the sponsorship process.

“So far the Anglican Diocese has not refused any partnerships for lack of capacity, but we are probably approaching our limit if we don’t get financial support to take on more staff,” says Smith.

In spite of these headaches, Lifeline Syria’s chair Omidvar continues to encourage Canadians to become refugee sponsors. “The enthusiasm is huge. But clearly it could be bigger if one could get clarity on this,” she says.",N/A,N/A,National Post,02-11-2016,http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/can-i-get-a-tax-receipt-tax-confusion-muddles-syrian-refugee-sponsorship-efforts,02-11-2016
0,Hudson’s Bay Co eyeing acquisition of bankrupt Dutch department store chain V&D,"TORONTO — Hudson’s Bay Co. could be bulking up even further.

The Toronto-based owner of Saks Fifth Ave. and Lord & Taylor is in the running to buy bankrupt department store chain V&D of the Netherlands, according to multiple Dutch media reports.

Several recent reports in the Dutch media, citing sources close to the negotiations, say HBC governor Richard Baker is squaring off for the stores against Dutch retail and real estate investor Roland Kahn of Cool Investments, owner of the Netherlands-based retail chains CoolCat, M & S Mode, America Today and the lingerie brand Sapph.

“Many landlords are charmed by (HBC’s) serious interest in a substantial part of the V&D buildings,” says a translated report from the publication AD.

“The problem is that both (Kahn) and HBC want only a part of the V&D buildings, especially those in large cities. Most owners, however, have buildings in both large and small municipalities.”

HBC did not confirm or deny the reports when reached for comment Wednesday. “It is company policy not to comment on rumour or speculation,” HBC spokeswoman Tiffany Bourré said in an email.

Such a deal would be the second this year for HBC, which has executed a number of savvy real estate acquisitions to grow and diversify its real estate and retail store network, which it is also expanding organically.

Last month, HBC announced its US$250-million purchase of online retailer Gilt.com, a “flash-sale” site that it will use to blend with its network of off-price stores and enhance the company’s mobile shopping capabilities.

In September, HBC closed its $3.8-billion acquisition of German department store chain Galeria Kaufhof, with 102 locations in Germany and 16 under the banner Galeria Inno in Belgium. Following the completion of the Galeria acquisition last September, HBC said it now generated a majority of its sales from outside of the United States.

“We believe that there are tremendous opportunities to grow the Kaufhof and Inno banners, and look forward to working with the existing management team to execute on our combined vision for the future of this business,” Jerry Storch, HBC’s CEO, said at the time. “This vision includes dramatic enhancements to the customer experience through the introduction of new brands, a focus on high-performing merchandise categories, substantial expansion of Kaufhof’s digital capabilities and, over time, introduction of Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off Fifth into the German market.”

This week, the Dutch publication Quote, citing sources close to Kaufhof, said insiders expect HBC will renovate V&D’s buildings in order to make way for its own stores, giving the Canadian retailer a solid foothold into the Netherlands. The German chain has strong similarities with V&D, according to Quote.

Netherlands-based publication NRC said V&D’s bankruptcy trustees will asses the plans of the most promising candidates next week.

Next week also marks the grand opening date for the first Saks Fifth Avenue store in Canada, adjacent to the flagship Hudson’s Bay store in downtown Toronto.",N/A,N/A,National Post,02-10-2016,http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/hudsons-bay-co-eyeing-acquisition-of-bankrupt-dutch-department-store-chain-vd,02-11-2016
0,"A 29-year-old patient died because her cardiologist didn’t take the time for a full exam, disciplinary tribunal hears","TORONTO – A city cardiologist charged with professional misconduct didn’t perform physician exams on some patients, and that may have, in one case, resulted in a death that could have been prevented, an expert witness told a disciplinary hearing at The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.

Testimony from the prosecution’s sole witness, cardiologist Dr. David Massell of Western Cardiologist Association in Victoria, B.C., consumed Wednesday’s proceedings, as college prosecutor Louis Sokolov led evidence in chief examination. Dr. William Hughes faces allegations, made public in January 2015, of failing to maintain the standard of practice of the profession, incompetence and engaging in acts or omissions that would be regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional.

The founder of Kawartha Cardiology Clinic has denied all allegations, which haven’t been proven.

Massell, hired by the college in November 2012 to review Hughes, evaluated 25 patient charts based on 450 visits and interviewed the doctor on March 25, 2013. He created five reports based on his findings after dedicating 369 hours to the project.

He found that 75 per cent of the diagnostic tests Hughes billed OHIP were “inappropriate,” that patients didn’t meet the criteria for billing because they weren’t physically examined during partial assessments – which Hughes has said don’t require exams.

Massell also found that patients were subject to unnecessary testing, at times to the detriment of their own health, such as when they were exposed to radiation.

He later explained how exposure is cumulative. Massell doesn’t let his own children get X-rays when they go the dentist, over his fears for their safety.

He said Hughes appeared to be testing on a routine basis, and not based on medical need. “We should be doing these tests on patients who need them and not as a matter of routine,” he said.

On Wednesday, the five-member tribunal heard detailed evidence about four of the 25 patients, including one whose death Massell said may have been prevented had Hughes detected a heart murmur by completing a physical exam.

The 29-year-old was referred to him by her family doctor, who found a heart murmur – an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat that is the sign of abnormality.

Hughes did not find the murmur because he didn’t physically examine her chest, Massell said.

Her exercise tolerance diminished to the point where she became short of breath and couldn’t walk more than two blocks.

Hughes, who was investigating her heart while being “pretty convinced” she had a lung problem, last saw the woman on Nov. 14, 2006.

I would have thought it would be impossible to see 75 patients in a day … I don’t think you can give patients the proper care and attention that they deserve
She was admitted to hospital from Nov. 28 to Dec. 2 and on Dec. 5, died from a lethal heart arrhythmia commonly associated with those with narrowed heart valves.

The woman, who can’t be named because of a publication ban, would be alive today if Hughes had identified the heart abnormality and fast-tracked the process to have her flawed valve replaced, Massell told the tribunal.

Her “problem was easily fixable,” he said, adding how she could have been back to good health in six to eight weeks, after surgery.

Massell also gave evidence involving elderly patients, saying Hughes did not complete physical exams, and said the amount of time Hughes actually spent with his patients were common concerns in each case.

Hughes was seeing up to 60 to 80 patients daily, judging from the doctor’s day sheets, where appointments are recorded.

Those numbers are “far beyond” the volume of patient he and his colleagues see at their clinics, Massell said. Later in the day, he said he sees about 16 while his colleagues see from 12 to a maximum of 20 patients a day.

“I would have thought it would be impossible to see 75 patients in a day … I don’t think you can give patients the proper care and attention that they deserve,” he said.

Getting to know a patient, leaning their history, coming up with a treatment plan and answering any questions they have “all takes time,” Massell said, noting how dictation of letters required as part of the job would take five hours alone, with Hughes’ number of patients.

In 75% of the cases he reviewed, a physical exam – “the cornerstone of what we do” – was not completed, the cardiologist said.

Massell said he can make most of his decisions with a stethoscope, exam room and a patient. Other assessment is as an adjunct, not a substitute. Medicine, in many ways, has become over-dependent on technology, he explained.

Massell explained how he began his review, in which he was tasked by the college to determine if Hughes displayed a lack of knowledge, had not met a standard of care and if his behaviours did, or was likely to, cause a patient harm or injury.

The cardiologist, who had completed a similar review a decade earlier, started with the charts of Hughes’ patients. He found them to be poorly organized and missing data.

For example, Hughes’ clinical reports were frequently in reverse chronological order, but the associated testing was not. “It was impossible to find a report of a study to refer to because it wasn’t in the right place you would expect it, right beside it.”

This prompted him to create a spreadsheet to help organize the materials.

The volume, and age, of information on the records also “made them very difficult to follow and understand what was happening,” Massell said.

“It looked like it had been pasted from one old history and pasted forward,” he said, later noting this could adversely affect the care of the patients

Data was also missing. Some 63 per cent of the charts of the 25 patients he reviewed were not accounted for, Massell said.

That figure is “far more” than random misplacement could account for and could have lead to medical re-ordering of testing “that is not necessary,” he said.

As Wednesday’s proceedings wrapped up, Sokolov indicated he expects to complete chief examination in about an hour Thursday.

Spafford said she may complete cross-examination Thursday, but more likely Friday – which exposed a communication breakdown regarding scheduling.

Massell said he already has a flight booked to return to Vancouver Thursday night, prompting the tribunal chair to ask the lawyers to settle the matter afterwards.

The hearing was scheduled to start Monday, but was postponed a day due to an illness. Tuesday was spent qualifying Massell as an expert witness.

Further hearing dates were previously scheduled for March 7 to 11, March 21 to 23, April 11 to 15, and April 25 and 26. Those dates are not listed on the CPSO website.",N/A,N/A,National Post,02-11-2016,http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/a-29-year-old-patient-died-because-her-cardiologist-didnt-take-the-time-for-a-full-exam-disciplinary-tribunal-hears,02-11-2016
0,"Which seven-letter country is Ottawa’s embassy row mysterious tax deadbeat?

","What’s a seven-letter name for a country that owes the City of Ottawa a pile of unpaid taxes?

Its identity is an official secret, but by late 2015 a country with an embassy in Ottawa owed the city more than $175,000 in back property taxes.

The information — with the name blacked out — is contained in an internal document from Global Affairs Canada. It was released under an access to information request by Embassy newspaper.

The document labeled “Secret” and “Canadian eyes only” says the property in question used to be an embassy, which had tax-exempt status, but it isn’t an embassy any more.

When the country moved its embassy staff elsewhere (the date is also redacted from the report), the Office of Protocol at Global Affairs Canada “advised (the country) that the property could no longer be deemed to form part of the property of the mission, and would therefore cease to benefit from any tax exemptions related to that status.”

But later, City of Ottawa officials contacted Global Affairs to say that taxes weren’t being paid.

It’s unclear whether all the back taxes are owing or only some.

By last summer, the debt had passed $175,000, “which has resulted in one of the worst debts of this nature attributed to a foreign mission recorded in recent history,” the internal report says.

The Office of Protocol sent a Note (with a capital N, meaning a formal diplomatic thing) “to seek a swift resolution of the Embassy’s accounts.”

Fat chance. The other country won’t even answer.

Now the Office of Protocol is “engaged with the geographic desk” to find “the best options and diplomacy tools” to get the debtors to pay up.

But as of December, it wrote, “this matter remains unresolved.”

If asking nicely doesn’t work, the City 0f Ottawa can fall back on gunboat diplomacy. For example, it’s allowed to shut off the water.

So which country is getting a free ride courtesy of other Ottawa taxpayers? That’s a secret guarded both by federal and city officials. The Global Affairs Canada document even blacks out information that it found in public media sources.

While the name of the country is redacted, there are clues.

The name appears to be a single word seven characters long, judging by the space it takes up in the typed text. (It could be six characters, if the capital letter at the beginning takes up a lot of space.) That lets out Switzerland, Iraq and Democratic Republic of Congo. Unfortunately there are some 50 countries with seven-letter names.

It has a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so it can’t be a country like the United States which has a State Department. It has an embassy here, not a high commission, letting out Britain, India and some others.

The country in question is the owner of the property, not a renter.",N/A,N/A,National Post,02-11-2016,http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/which-seven-letter-country-is-ottawas-embassy-row-mysterious-tax-deadbeat,02-11-2016
0,Edmonton Transit having hard time making buses run on time,"Edmonton Transit is having a hard time making the buses run on time.

In 2014, as few as 58 per cent of ETS buses arrived at key timing points between five minutes early and one minute late, although the goal is for them to meet this standard 90 per cent of the time, says a new city auditor’s report. 

The system never came close to meeting the standard from 2012 to 2015 and performance, instead dropped steadily, figures in the report released Thursday indicate.

The best months of the year for bus reliability are June to August — 74 per cent of the fleet was on time in this period in 2012, dropping to 69 per cent in 2014.

The worst months were from December to January, when reliability dropped from 60 per cent in 2012 to 58 per cent two years later.

“ETS management advised us that they believe the decline in performance is a reflection of an increase in the number of persons with mobility devices and strollers, construction activity and increased traffic congestion on city streets,” city auditor David Wiun wrote.

“They also advised us that the 2012 through 2015 operating budgets did not include funding to address schedule adherence and overload issues.”

The problem was also seen at Edmonton’s 26 transit centres, where average on-time arrivals went down to 60 per cent from 63 per cent between 2012 and 2014.

The latest figures show while some centres always met the proper arrival times, 19 of them were off schedule at least half the time for one period of the day, and one site only met the target for 18 per cent of trips.

ETS carried 89 million passengers in 2014, growing faster than Edmonton’s rapid population increase. However, that year there were an estimated 21,700 people left at the side of the road by buses that were too crowded to carry anyone else.

Officials hope to reduce this problem with better scheduling, electronic SmartFare cards and Smart Buses that provide real-time arrival information.

Although Wiun concluded ETS operations are being run efficiently and economically compared to other cities, he found a major jump in the amount of disorder being reported.

There were 6,871 incidents such as loitering, liquor infractions, disturbances, misconduct and smoking reported by transit and downtown peace officers in 2014, up 61 per cent from the 4,264 incidents reported two years earlier.

At the same time, personal crimes, such as assault, uttering threats, robbery and sexual offences, rose 14 per cent, to 339.

ETS officials believe the addition of 10 peace officers in 2010 contributed to the increased reporting, the report says.

Although passenger surveys showed a slight drop in satisfaction with personal safety from 2014 to 2015, at least 75 per cent of respondents still felt safe waiting or riding on ETS vehicles.

The report will be discussed Feb. 19 by city council’s audit committee.",N/A,N/A,Edmonton Journal,02-11-2016,http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-transit-having-hard-time-making-buses-run-on-time,02-11-2016
0,Molson Coors says weak economy affecting beer sales in oil-producing provinces,"ONTREAL - Molson Coors Brewing Co. says a sluggish economy and higher food prices are affecting beer drinking in Canada's oil-rich provinces.

The Denver and Montreal-based company said the beer industry has seen customers, particularly in Alberta, shift from higher-priced premium to economy brands.

Overall sales volumes have also been slipping in Alberta, as well as in the oil-producing provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan.

Molson said its sales volume decreased 5.4 per cent across Canada in the fourth quarter. In January, sales to retailers for at-home consumption fell by more than 10 per cent, or by almost nine per cent excluding the impact of the termination of an agreement to distribute Miller brands.

Part of that decrease can be attributed to macro-economic factors, including higher food prices, said Stewart Glendinning, chief executive of Molson Coors Canada.

""The consumer is under pressure,"" he said Thursday during a conference call on the company's fourth-quarter and 2015 results.

""And if you add to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada is at an all-time high, it's made for quite a difficult recipe in some of those provinces.""

Sales volumes for Coors Light were also reduced in Quebec by the brewer's decision to raise prices for its flagship brand.

Molson Coors (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) said its net income plummeted 65 per cent to US$32.8 million in the fourth quarter because of lower sales, currency fluctuations and reduced income from operations in Canada and the United States.

The company, which reports in U.S. dollars, said its underlying profit in the quarter, excluding one-time items, was $90.6 million or 49 cents per share, down 11.3 per cent from $102.1 million or 55 cents per share a year earlier.

Net sales for the period ended Dec. 31 were $844.4 million, compared were $973.8 million a year earlier — a decrease of 13.3 per cent, or 3.5 per cent excluding currency fluctuations.

In Canada, adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell 32 per cent to $51.8 million on $341.9 million in net sales. That compared with $76.2 million on US$423.1 million in net sales for the same period a year earlier.

The drop in profits was partially due to a US$6.9-million currency hit from the lower Canadian dollar. Excluding currency, profits decreased 23 per cent.

For the full year, the company's (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) net profits decreased to US$359.5 million from $514 million in 2014. Underlying profits were $700.4 million or $3.76 per share, down from $768.5 million or $4.13 per share a year earlier.

0,Graham Thomson: Alberta's NDP gets caught in BC's political crossfire,"In politics, there are drive-by smears and drive-by insults.

Now, British Columbia has introduced the drive-by throne speech.

On Tuesday evening, reading from a throne speech written by the government of Christy Clark, Lt.-Gov. Judith Guichon hit the gas pedal and took aim.

“Over the decades, Alberta lost its focus,” said Guichon. “They expected their resource boom never to end, failed to diversify their economy and lost control of government spending.”

I have never heard of a throne speech taking aim at another provincial government in such a negative way. It’s a bit like using the Queen to take out a hit on your neighbour.

In this case, BC was raising Alberta as a cautionary tale about government overspending.

Critics of the Alberta government immediately took to social media to declare the NDP has made such a mess of things that the BC government is fed up and speaking out.

But that’s not what the speech said.

By referring to “decades” and the “boom,” the speech was shooting at former Progressive Conservative governments that were in power for decades during boom times.

The NDP has been in power less than a year and if the word “boom” is used at all these days it refers to the sound of our economy being blown apart by the depressed price of oil.

But the BC speech clearly bothered Alberta’s government enough that it sent out Economic Development Minister Deron Bilous to drive home the point that the NDP was never the intended target.

“I interpret this as an attack on the previous government and their failure to diversify the economy,” said Bilous. 

(In an interview, spokesman Ben Chin with Clark’s office said the reference to Alberta was indeed looking to the past, not the present).

Bashing Alberta PC governments-of-old became a theme of sorts on Wednesday with the release of the latest report from Alberta’s auditor general.

Reports from the auditor general can be so laden with bureaucratese it would be easier to literally eat some chapters than read them. This new document is no exception but Merwan Saher also provided plenty of meat amongst the linguistic gristle.

The issue he addresses first deals with the government’s Royalty Reduction Programs that, in the 2014-15 fiscal year, handed out $1.4 billion in royalty reductions so that energy companies would pump out oil and gas that would otherwise be unrecoverable. The idea being the province would ultimately benefit from increased royalties from the extra oil and gas.

But it turns out the government doesn’t keep track of the program to see if it’s actually making or losing money.

We’re talking here of a system introduced by previous PC governments and so it was easy on Wednesday for the new NDP government to happily point the finger of blame backwards.

But there was something else on Wednesday that appeared to point the finger directly at the new Alberta government.

That takes us back to Christy Clark’s throne speech that made a point of saying BC’s carbon tax “is a truly revenue-neutral tax – not an opportunistic reach into taxpayers’ wallets.”

That had observers wondering if Clark was taking a swipe at Premier Rachel Notley’s carbon tax but, again, Ben Chin in Clark’s office says Notley wasn’t the target.

“That’s really aimed across the floor at our (NDP) opposition,” said Chin. “We have a good working relationship with the Notley government and think it’s very important for us to work together for the benefit of Albertans and British Columbians.”

But the mix up between the NDP there and here is understandable.

And you have to suspect with BC already in campaign mode ahead of an election in May of 2017, whenever Clark takes aim at her NDP opposition at home, the NDP here is going to get caught in the cross fire.",N/A,N/A,Edmonton Journal,02-10-2016,http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/graham-thomson-albertas-ndp-gets-caught-in-bcs-political-crossfire,02-11-2016
0,"Bottcher, Thomas likeliest challengers for Koe's title at Boston Pizza Cup","CAMROSE — Charley Thomas and Brendan Bottcher know exactly what they’re up against at the Boston Pizza Cup this week if they have any plans to try and dethrone Kevin Koe from a third straight provincial title — but they’re up for the challenge.

“If we get to the final, we’re going to have to have the best game of our life, because we know a team like Kevin Koe’s is going to show up,” said Thomas, who won a Canadian and world title back in 2007 and currently sits eighth on the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS) standings.

Bottcher faced Koe in the provincial final last year, and he knows that his team can learn from that experience and use it as motivation this time around.

“Last year it was all about proving that we deserved to be there and this year I still think we have to have that same mentality even though we’ve had some experience,” said Bottcher, of his Saville Centre team of third Tom Appleman, second Bradley Thiessen and lead Karrick Martin.

“We know what to expect. We know the pressures you’ll face on the weekend and being in front of the cameras, and there’s a level of comfort there that we may not have had in the past.”

It’s been a five-star season for the Koe rink that features third Marc Kennedy, second Brent Laing and lead Ben Hebert.

If you judge team Koe’s year solely based on results, it would be safe to say that the team he hand-picked after the 2014 season to go on a run for an Olympic berth in 2018 is hitting its stride as the foursome settles in to defend their provincial title.

So far, 2016 has been great, but Koe feels they are on the cusp of even bigger things.

“It’s been a great year. We couldn’t ask for more, really. We won a Grand Slam, a Canada Cup win that secured a spot for the Olympic Trials, and we’ve won a couple other events and we’ve just played great,” said Koe, who sits second on the World Curling Tour money list with $112,856 in earnings.

“But we’re still learning. A year and a half isn’t really that much time for a new team and we definitely have room for improvement. I know we have a lot more in us.”

Koe, Bottcher and Thomas all had big wins in their opening draw on Wednesday night. Koe cruised to an 8-2 win over Brent Bawel, while Bottcher crushed Tom Sallows 9-2, and Thomas stole five straight points to earn a 7-2 win over Kevin Yablonski.

While Koe’s team is the heavy favourite to represent the province again at the Tim Horton’s Brier in Ottawa next month, Thomas and Bottcher are the two best bets to give Koe a solid run for that Brier berth. Their experience on the big stage with prior Canadian and World Junior experience as well as their success on the World Curling Tour the past couple years will give them confidence that will likely see them front and centre come playoff time.

“For us, it’s about playing our way. If we get stuck in the big spectacle that Koe’s won it so many years in a row, that’s not how we’re going to win,” said Bottcher.

For Thomas, he’s factored into the playoff picture in past years at provincials, but he feels this year his team that consists of third Nathan Connolly, second Brandon Klassen and lead D.J. Kidby has the ability to take it a step further.

“Every year you feel like you’re closer, but we’re still a little ways away from crossing that major threshold of getting into those big playoff games, and that will be a constant reminder this week,” said Thomas.

“For us, it starts early in the week, and we have to build that consistency that hopefully gets us all the way to the final.”",N/A,N/A,Edmonton Journal,02-10-2016,http://edmontonjournal.com/sports/curling/bottcher-thomas-likeliest-challengers-for-koes-title-at-boston-pizza-cup,02-11-2016
0,"Kevin Smith talks Batman, Comic Book Men and the meaning of life","It was the bat symbol that got him. That bright yellow oval and black silhouette placed – bam! – smackdab in the middle of Adam West’s chest.

Kevin Smith was just a kid and Batman, the comic, was truth pressed in ink. Batman, the TV show then airing in reruns, was catharsis via cathode ray tube.

“Adam West’s Batman TV show – what an impact it had. That dopey symbol on his chest would come to define my entire life,” says Smith, the filmmaker, actor, writer and podcaster behind AMC’s comic book store reality series Comic Book Men.

“When I was a kid, sports were treated very seriously. I was into comic books, which is kind of like sports because people wear uniforms and protective headgear, and generally speaking it’s good versus evil. But for some reason, my passion was always diminished, like, ‘Oh, that’s for kids.’”

Of course, these days comic book-inspired movies and TV shows are everywhere – Supergirl, Gotham and Deadpool, oh my! – and Smith is enjoying somewhat of a comeuppance.

Since his comic book awakening, he’s written the limited series Batman: Cacophony and the Batman mini-series The Widening Gyre, and he’s penned stories for Daredevil, Green Arrow and Green Hornet, as well as his own creations.

Comic Book Men, back for the second half of Season 5 on Sunday, plays like an ode to such unabashed geekery.

The show is set at Smith’s comic book store, Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash, in Red Bank, N.J. He and his friends talk shop while guests like William Shatner, Dean Cain and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca from Star Wars) stop by. The companion podcast The Secret Stash runs on the SModcast network.

“There are many comic book shows out there, but this is like a big comic-con show. It’s the show for people who attend comic-cons and love comic book movies,” says Smith, the writer-director of films like Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma.

Not that he’s a snob. Both newbies and longtime fans are welcome to revel in the shenanigans in those stylized panels – and any films or television series that spring forth from them.

“I mean, the more the merrier. I’ve never been one of those garage band fans where you’re like, ‘I liked them when they were cool.’ I’m happy when everybody likes this s—. It legitimizes it,” Smith says.

“I saw that (George) Lucas and (Steven) Spielberg were like, ‘People will get tired of this.’ I hope not. I love comic book movies. Look, there’ve been a gazillion movies about war. There’ve been a gazillion westerns. Why can’t there be a gazillion comic book movies?

“They’re simple morality tales, at the end of the day. Good has to fight evil and God willing, good wins. And hey, everybody’s dressed real fun.”

Online and digital culture has also proven key in spreading the love, Smith says.

“Before we had the Internet, you’d read about (comic book fans) in the letters column of a comic book – you never met them unless you went to a comic book show. Now you can just type in ‘Deadpool’ and suddenly you have 10,000 friends. You can sit there and discuss your passion all day long.

“I love that we live in that now. I love that something that was in reruns when I was a kid, Batman, shaped my life to the point where years later I’m still talking about it.”

Incidentally, Smith did have a full-circle moment with that yellow-and-black Batman emblem of his youth.

It was stowed in a building stocked with TV props and wardrobe pieces from the last 60 or 70 years of American television, and Smith’s guide presented to him the original batsuits, the ones Adam West and Burt Ward wore on the 1960s show.

“It was made of the cheapest f—ing cardboard you could imagine. Painted yellow with a bat stenciled on it. It wasn’t made from gold or the plates that came from God or something like that. Some costume person took maybe an hour to put it together and didn’t even sew it on – they hot-glued it,” he says.

“It was just as real as anything else, but it shaped something very real in me. It gave me a morality. I didn’t learn much about myself in school, and I didn’t learn much about myself sitting in a church congregation, but I damn skippy learned a lot about myself sitting in movie theatres looking at art, watching TV, listening to music, reading books.

“That bat symbol, man, it was weird to see it in real life. Weird to see how fragile it was, and kind of poetic. Because that’s all life is at the end of the day – fragile as Batman’s fake bat symbol on the very first costume he wore in the pilot.”",N/A,N/A,Edmonton Journal,02-10-2016,http://www.edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/television/kevin+smith+talks+batman+comic+book+meaning/11711101/story.html,02-11-2016
0,BOSMA TRIAL: What was in the trailer containing Bosma's truck?,"A Halton police identification officer took the stand Thursday to talk about evidence police found on Tim Bosma's pickup truck and the trailer it was found in.

Det. Const. Laura McLellan was one of the identification officers called in on May 14 to examine and photograph the large trailer containing Bosma's truck and the truck itself.

She will show the jury a series of photos Thursday afternoon, outlining that process.

At the Bosma murder trial, the Crown outlined phone records that traced the movements of Dellen Millard and Mark Smich's phones in the hours and days after the Ancaster resident went missing.

All of this movement was laid out for the jury in maps prepared by OPP operational intelligence analyst Phillip Wilkinson, showing the trajectory of phones belonging to six people (including Millard, Smich and their girlfriends) based on cell tower ""ping"" locations between May 3 and May 10, 2013.

Specifically, the records -- showing cell towers the phones ""pinged"" off at different times -- highlighted the phones' locations during two key times the jury has heard about.

•One was the early hours of May 7, when the Crown asserts Bosma's body was burned in an incinerator near the Millardair hangar at the Region of Waterloo International Airport.

Millard's phone was pinging off towers near the airport during that time.

Smich's phone, court heard, stopped communicating after 9:20 p.m. on May 6 until the next morning--which, in cross examination, Wilkinson agreed is consistent with it either being turned off (as Millard's lawyer Ravin Pillay asked) or died (as Smich's lawyer Thomas Dungey asked).

Later on the morning of May 7, a phone known as the ""Smich/Meneses phone"" (linked to him and his girlfriend Marlena Menses), was pinning off towers between the farm and hangar around 11:30 a.m.

•A second important time frame was the night of May 9, when the Crown says Millard and his girlfriend, Christina Noudga, hauled the trailer containing Bosma's truck up to his mother's house in Kleinburg, ON.

Wilkinson began his presentation Wednesday, when court heard that Millard and Smich's phones -- and the mysterious ""Lucas Bate"" phone, a bogus name police believe, that was used to call Bosma to set up the test drive -- were all ""pinging"" off towers near Bosma's Ancaster home the night of May 6, before he disappeared.

A York Regional Police forensic video analyst also testified Thursday about footage captured by a resident on Westbridge Drive (near Tinsmith Court in Kleinburg) that showed a truck driving by pulling a trailer around 10:50 p.m. on May 9.",N/A,N/A,Hamilton Spectator,02-11-2016,http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6273654-bosma-trial-what-was-in-the-trailer-containing-bosma-s-truck-/,02-11-2016
0,Driveway shooting victim always had time for family,"A few hours after Jon Styres was laid to rest by his family, Peter Khill made his first appearance before the courts Tuesday afternoon.

Stating his name — and not much else — through the court's video remand system, a sombre Khill let his lawyer, Derek Martin, tell the court that their legal team needed more time to prepare before setting a bail hearing date.

The judge granted a request for Khill to reappear by video at 2 p.m. on Thursday at the John Sopinka Courthouse. At that point the defence hopes to set a bail hearing date for Friday, said Martin.

The funeral for 29-year-old Styres was scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the Styres Funeral Home in Ohsweken.

Styres was shot and killed in a Glanbrook driveway Feb. 4 after allegedly attempting to steal a truck.

Khill was charged with second-degree murder by Hamilton police.

Six Nations activist Janie Jamieson said Styres had a tough life growing up, bouncing around foster homes.

She expects this death, in combination with another aboriginal man's death in Brantford this weekend, could become a watershed moment in the conversation to include men in the murdered and missing aboriginal women movement.

""There's reason to believe the number of murdered and missing aboriginal men is somewhat higher than that of women,"" she said. ""It is not open season on our aboriginal men.""

Natasha Hill, Styres' girlfriend from his late-teens to mid-20s, said Styres struggled to get the support he needed early on in life.

His parents were separated, and Styres lived with his mother until he was eight, she said. He lived with his aunt for a number of years before he began living on his own at around 14 or 15 years old. Styres never finished high school, but managed to develop a knack for handiwork, earning him odd jobs at Grand River Enterprises, on windmills and in general construction.

Styres frequently used his skills to help his friends and family, she said.

Whether you needed a ride, an oil change, brakes replaced or help building something, ""all you had to do was ask, and Jon would do it,"" said Natasha.

Lifelong friend of Styres, Sharon Hill, said Styres loved to spend a lot of his time just hanging around her family, walking around with a big grin on his face. Holding back tears, Sharon said she'll miss hearing Styres pipe up with ""What-cha up to?"" every time she walked into the house.

""He always knew when you were down, and would know how to make you feel better,"" said Sharon.

Despite his personal struggles, Styres had a lot of time for family, regularly taking his nephews on dirt biking trips into the bush and skateboarding around town, Natasha said. When his two daughters came into the picture, he loved taking them swimming, to the park or even the Simcoe fair, while his partner was working.

His eldest daughter turned two the day after he died.

""When he had his daughters he was so proud, he was trying to smarten up,"" said Natasha, adding that all Styres wanted was to be there for his daughters, and give them a life he never had growing up.",N/A,N/A,Hamilton Spectator,02-10-2016,http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6270754-driveway-shooting-victim-always-had-time-for-family/,02-11-2016
0,Giant sinkhole swallows vehicle at Kitchener intersection,"KITCHENER — No barriers were across a flooded road to stop a truck from driving into a two-metre-deep sinkhole early Wednesday morning.

Two men in the truck escaped without injury, but were wet after climbing out of their submerged vehicle on Strasburg Road, Waterloo Regional Police report.

""We asked for the road to be closed and there was no response,"" said Wally Malcolm, director at Kitchener Utilities.

Water workers were called at 1 a.m. about a problem on Strasburg, between Trillium Drive and Battler Road.

They found water gushing from a ruptured, 18-inch water main and called for police to block the road and for other city workers to bring in traffic barriers.

That didn't happen, Malcolm said.

Utility workers started trying to shut of water valves south of the break in the middle of the road, he said.

Police say they were notified about the water main break at 2:23 a.m.

Malcolm said no police were there about 3:20 a.m., when the truck and trailer turned from Trillium and began wading through water rushing along Strasburg. It didn't get far before crashing into the hole.

Malcolm has started an investigation into why the road wasn't closed sooner. He's waiting to talk with workers who were busy trying to fix the broken main.

Pipe repairs are expected to take several days. Strasburg is closed between Battler and Trillium.

It's unusual for a vehicle to drive into a sinkhole caused by a water main break in Kitchener, Malcolm said. The last time he can remember that happening was in the late 1980s.

It not unusual for motorists to drive around road closed barriers, endangering workers, he said.

In this case, Malcolm understands the truck approached from the opposite side of the break from workers, who had no chance to warn the driver about the water-covered pit.

The work truck from TriGreen landscaping had water up to its rooftop as city crews used an industrial pump to drain the sinkhole about 7:30 a.m. The trailer stayed on the road, mostly out of the water.

Two tow trucks were waiting to pull out the truck and trail out of the hole. That happened about 10:30 a.m.

0,Tim Hortons customers want to Roll Up the Rim — without the paper cup,"It's a national pastime each winter, as Canadians across the country eagerly ""Roll Up the Rim"" to win prizes with their morning cups of Tim Hortons coffee.

But now, thousands reusable mug owners are calling on the popular chain to let them play without being forced to take a paper cup.

""Customers should not be forced to choose between an environmentally conscious option and participating in Roll Up the Rim,"" a petition at Change.org reads.

By Thursday morning, more than 14,000 people had signed on.

The petition was first launched last year by Ally Fraser of Beaumont, Alta. In a post this week, she said she presented the petition to Tim Hortons' corporate head office but did not get a positive response.

""They dismissed our concerns. This year, with so much support, maybe they will finally listen,"" she wrote.

0,North Korea seizes industrial park after South’s pullout of staff,"SEOUL, South Korea North Korea on Thursday seized South Korea's machinery and manufactured goods at a jointly run industrial park on their border in a riposte to the South's decision to order all its citizens home from the site.

Along with a North Korean decision to switch off both its high-level telephone hotlines to the South, the closure of their main point of business exchange reflects the bitterness between the two governments since a nuclear test and a long-range rocket test by Pyongyang.

First, South Korea announced it was withdrawing its staff as a protest. Then North Korea's KCNA news agency reported Pyongyang was putting the complex under military control and giving its South Korean staff until 5 pm Thursday to get out.

Within hours, all the South Korean staff at the Kaesong joint industrial complex, which lies in the communist North, had left, the government in Seoul said.

The Kaesong factory estate, only a few kilometers from the heavily militarized border, served as a window to the outside world for the reclusive North and earned scarce foreign exchange for Pyongyang.

Some 54,000 low-paid North Koreans work in more than 124 factories, which produce textiles, clothes, household appliances and parts for machines, cars and semiconductors. Their wages were paid directly to the North's government. Construction of the site began in 2004.

A statement by Pyongyang's agency for dealings with the south, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK), said: ""It will completely freeze all assets including equipment, materials and products of the South Korean enterprises ...

""The persons to be expelled are not allowed to take things out of the zone, except for their personal belongings.""

Once they had left, the North's military communication and Panmunjom hotlines to the south were to be cut off, it added.

On Jan. 6, North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test since 2006. It launched a satellite into orbit on Sunday using a rocket that could also serve as a long-range ballistic missile.

Using its usual heightened language, the CPRK said Seoul's pullout was ""an end to the last lifeline of north-south relations"" and ""a dangerous declaration of war"" which would cost the south and its businesses dearly.

Western countries and the U.N. Security Council have condemned the launch as a test of nuclear-capable technology and a violation of previous agreements, and threatened tighter sanctions against the regime.

The U.S. Senate late Wednesday passed a bill approving stricter measures by U.S. authorities against efforts to help North Korea's nuclear program or other violations of the sanctions.",N/A,N/A,Hamilton Spectator,02-11-2016,http://www.thespec.com/news-story/6274146-north-korea-seizes-industrial-park-after-south-s-pullout-of-staff/,02-11-2016
0,"Final holdout at Ore. refuge surrenders after dramatic negotiations
","Four holdouts at a federal wildlife refuge surrendered peacefully Thursday to end a 41-day takeover, but not before one protester balked at the last moment and threatened to shoot himself in a rambling, nearly two-hour discussion livestreamed online.

David Fry, 27, speaking by cellphone with an online program, said he was ""feeling suicidal"" only moments after his three companions peacefully surrendered to the FBI and a group of negotiators led by evangelist Franklin Graham.

""I am actually pointing a gun at my head. I am tired of living here,"" said Fry, who is from Ohio, at one point. ""You guys took away everything from me, for doing nothing wrong.""

In a long, confusing rant to online commentator Gavin Seim, Fry complained of his taxes paying for abortions and his marijuana being taken away. He was referring to Ohio voters last year turning down a bill to legalize the sale of marijuana.

""I will no longer be a slave to this system,"" he said, growing increasingly agitated. ""I am a free man and I will die a free man.""

In the end, Fry simply gave up after telling an FBI negotiator by phone he only wanted everyone to shout ""hallelujah"" if he walked out.

As he fumbled with the cellphone, Fry could be heard shouting, ""hallelujah,"" and then said, ""one more cookie and one more cigarette"" before strolling to the FBI checkpoint.

The other three unarmed holdouts gave up without incident. They walked one by one toward an olive green armored vehicle carrying Graham and Nevada lawmaker Michele Fiore.

Holding hands, Sean Anderson, 48, of Riggins, Idaho, and his wife, Sandy, 47, went first, their arms held high. Sean carried an American flag in his right hand. Sandy was patted down by an FBI agent and then taken away. Jeff Banta, 46, of Yerington, Nev., went next.

The FBI said the four would be arraigned before a federal judge in Portland on Friday.

Graham, at the request of the protesters and the FBI, was in phone contact with the group for the past week to negotiate an end to the standoff. The North Carolina preacher joined Fiore in an armored vehicle to reach the four holdouts.

The surrender process capped a five-week ordeal that included the arrest of almost a dozen protesters and the shooting death of one in a confrontation with police.

The final act of the drama Thursday morning played out in real time through a phone call streamed online, with Fiore and Graham staying in touch with the protesters. ""America's watching, so nothing is going to happen,"" Fiore said.

Before the surrender, Graham also spoke to the group by phone. ""We are proud of you and love you and look forward to giving you guys a big hug,"" Graham said before praying and climbing into a vehicle to drive to the surrender site.

""We haven't bathed in a few days so don't be offended,"" Sean Anderson replied. At one point, Anderson even joked they were ""hoping to stop at Denny's"" before going to jail.

In a bizarre twist to the final chapter in the takeover, which began Jan. 2 as a protest against federal land-use policies, FBI agents arrested Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, the father of the protesters' jailed leader, who flew to the state in a show of support.

Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, arrived at the standoff site in Burns, Ore., around 8 a.m. PT., at about the time when Sean Anderson said the group planned to turn themselves in at a nearby FBI checkpoint.

Graham, who is based in North Carolina, said on his Facebook page that he had been speaking with the four holdouts by phone everyday at the request of the protesters and the FBI.

""Last night I was on the phone with them for several hours, was able to have prayer with them, and they have said they would come out today,"" he said in the Wednesday night post. ""I am on my  way there and hope to be there by 7:00 AM their time. Please keep them, law enforcement officials, and all involved in your prayers, that everyone will be safe.""

The FBI said agents ""moved to contain"" the last four holdouts Wednesday by hemming them in with armored vehicles at the refuge. ""We reached a point where it became necessary to take action in a way that best ensured the safety of those on the refuge,"" Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge, said Wednesday in a statement.

Bundy, 69, of Bunkerville, Nev., was arrested by the FBI after stepping off a plane at Portland International Airport on Wednesday evening. He was taken to Multnomah County jail.

A post on Bundy Ranch's Facebook page said: ""Cliven Bundy just landed in Portland; we are being told by eyes on ground that he was surrounded by SWAT and DETAINED.""

The elder Bundy faces federal charges related to a standoff at his ranch with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in 2014, according to the Bundy web site. Bundy, who defied authorities in a dispute over federal land rights, owes $1 million in grazing fees and penalties.

He has been charged, among other counts, with weapons violations and one count of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer, the U.S. Justice Department in Nevada said in a statement.  If convicted, Bundy faces more than 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 per count.

Bundy, 69, of Bunkerville, Nev., is charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, assault on a federal law enforcement officer, using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, obstruction of the administration of justice, and interference with commerce by extortion, the U.s. Justice Department office in Nevada said in a statement.

If convicted, Bundy faces more than 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 per count.

His sons, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, were jailed following the Jan. 26 arrest of several members of the armed militia group on charges of interfering with federal officers.

One protester, Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, was killed during a confrontation with the FBI and state troopers after fleeing a police roadblock.

The protesters said the Jan. 2 takeover was mounted in support for local rancher Dwight and Stev4e Hammond, who were convicted of setting fire to federal land. It was also aimed at sparking a broader rebellion against government control of public lands.

The Harney County court said in a statement after the takeover ended that federal land issue need to be addressed, but that the presence in the area of militia groups continues ""to cause division in the country and every community within.""

""Continued militia presence in Harney County will only serve to delay any meaningful work on the issues that need to be addressed,"" the statement said.
We are very grateful that the occupation ended peacefully and we look forward to the day when our community is ours, once again.""

0,Ford to launch 4 -- count 'em -- 4 new SUVs,"CHICAGO — Ford said Thursday that it will launch four all-new sport-utility vehicles over the next four years in recognition of the growing global popularity of SUVs and crossovers.

""That’s all new entries,"" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Chicago Auto Show. ""These are in segments of the SUV market where we currently do not compete.""

So far, Ford is not saying when or where the new nameplates will be added, but it is emphasizing that the products are part of its global plan. As such, the new models could be added either to the automaker's mainstream Ford brand or to Lincoln.

The SUVs could be launched in North America, Europe, Asia or South America or in all of those regions.

The Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker also says there are no plans to eliminate any models as part of the plans.

In the U.S., consumers have been increasingly choosing to buy small and midsize crossovers, and the percentage of passenger cars is shrinking.

Last year, LaNeve said Ford sold 740,000 Ford Escape, Explorer, Edge and Lincoln SUVs in the U.S., the most since the early 2000s.

""We can't keep them on dealer lots,"" LaNeve said.

Both Baby Boomers and Millennials increasingly prefer SUVs and crossovers because they offer more space than a car with the same footprint while also offering improved fuel economy over the SUVs of the past.

“Some SUVs now rival the fuel efficiency of V-6-powered midsize sedans from only a few years ago,” LaNeve said.

Ford says its research shows that once Millennials begin thinking about starting a family, their interest in shopping for SUVs goes up significantly.

While Millennials get driver's licenses later than prior generations, get married later and graduate from college later, ""they get there,"" LaNeve said.

And when they do buy cars, they prefer SUVs.",N/A,N/A,USA Today,02-11-2016,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/02/11/ford-motor-company-suvs-chicago-auto-show/80224714/,02-11-2016
0,"Trump, Univision settle beauty pageant lawsuit","Donald Trump and Univision said Thursday they have settled the lawsuit stemming from the Hispanic network’s decision to not broadcast the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants last year.

Trump, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, sued Univision last June for $500 million after Univision dropped the beauty pageants – owned by Trump at the time -- following his disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants.

Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.

“I have known Univision’s President and CEO, Randy Falco, for more than 20 years and I’m glad we are able to put these differences behind us,” Trump said in a statement released by Univision.

The suit, filed in New York by his Miss Universe Organization, claimed that Univision's decision broke contractual terms and was ""a politically motivated attempt to suppress Mr. Trump's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.""

0,Google extends European Right to Be Forgotten link blocks,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google will extend the platforms that will block links of people who have successfully lobbied European regulators for their ""right to be forgotten.""

The search giant will block links on all its international platforms, including the U.S. search platform google.com, for searches coming from the country of the person who requested the block, according to a person familiar with the new policy.

In simpler terms, this is how the change will work: if a person in Austria were to successfully petition to have a link about themselves blocked, it would be blocked when someone searched using any of Google's European domains — and also when someone in Austria searches Google.com, Google.cn or Google.jp.

The link would still be visible to anyone outside of Austria who searched those sites.

Blocking searches on non-European sites represents a change from its previous policy, when only its European-based sites would block links. .

Google notified the European Union's Data Protection Agency of the coming change two weeks ago. It is expected to go into effect soon, the person said.

The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company has been fighting the E.U. on the breadth of what it must block under European data privacy law for two years. The change came because of ongoing pressure from European courts and policymakers in several E.U countries, the person said.

The news was first reported by EFE, a Spanish news agency based in Madrid.

""In addition to our current practice of removing links from European domains, we will soon begin removing those links in all Google domains, for people searching from the applicant's country,"" Google told the news service.

Under European privacy law, individuals have the right to ask their country's Data Protection Agency for removal of search engine results that link to information that is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive.

The original Right to be Forgotten ruling came in 2014. It was the result of a Spanish man's request to delete a legal notice in a Spanish newspaper's online archive about the 1998 repossession of his home. The notice popped up when his name was searched in Google.

He said that because the proceeding had happened years ago and was now irrelevant, it should be removed from the newspaper's searchable archive.

The Spanish court ruled the paper could keep the page up on its own site but that Google and other search engines must remove the listing from their search indexes, to protect the man's privacy.

Since that ruling, Google and other search engines have been blocking links when Europeans successfully petition to have information ""forgotten.""

However those blocks only applied to the European sites of the search engines, such as Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France. Searchers in Europe could easily get around the blocks by going to Google.com or another the international site outside of Europe.

Users in the U.S. can't request such blocks.",N/A,N/A,USA Today,02-11-2016,http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/11/google-blocking-right-to-be-forgotten-european-union/80233490/,02-11-2016
0,This is what Twitter's new timeline looks like,"Stop etching the grave stones. Delete the eulogies. Twitter timelines are going to be just fine.

Users of the social network had worried an algorithm would ruin their feeds, swapping the service's rapid fire feel for something more like a Facebook feed. That fretting reached a fever pitch over the weekend, spawning the popular hashtag #RIPTwitter.

The change is here, and judging from an early look at post-algorithm Twitter, it's certainly not as bad as previously thought.

Before we dig into the new timeline, let's quickly recap how this all started. Last Friday, Buzzfeed reported Twitter planned on changing timelines, moving away from a reverse-chronological structure (most recent tweets at the top) to an algorithm that would examine who you follow and pick the best tweets you missed. Outrage, well at least on Twitter, was fierce.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later commented timelines would stay as they are and professed his love for ""the live stream."" On Tuesday it announced the changes, which it calls ""Never miss important Tweets from people you follow.""

Now that the timelines are rolling out, they're nowhere near as bad as many feared. Basically, the algorithm will move older tweets that it deems valuable higher up on the timeline. It's subtle. Users may first notice a message on their timeline that reads ""never miss an important tweet,"" letting them know the feature is available.

(Clarification:In an earlier Periscope, I mention this is connected to Twitter's While You Were Away feature, which highlights important tweets you may have missed while away from the service. That's not correct. The only real way to tell is by viewing the timestamps on a tweet to tell if they've been shifted).

Frankly, it's difficult to tell when the algorithm has made any changes, but that could vary depending on how many accounts you follow and other activity. Users finding it disruptive can shut it off. On the web, Twitter users go to settings, then account, then the content section to disable. On mobile, you go to Settings and look for Timeline or Timeline personalization to shut it off.

If this is how Twitter's algorithm functions, turning it off might not be necessary.  Now if we can just get Twitter to add that edit button.",N/A,N/A,USA Today,02-11-2016,http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/11/what-twitters-new-timeline-looks-like/80234094/,02-11-2016
0,"Insurers Under Pressure to Improve Margins on Health Plans
","After most health insurers racked up financial losses on Affordable Care Act plans in 2014, many companies’ results for last year worsened, creating heavy pressure to improve performance this year.

An analysis of filings by not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers—among the biggest players in the law’s exchanges for buying individual insurance—shows the challenge facing the industry as it seeks a turnaround in the individual business. They paid out more for health care in the first three quarters of 2015 than they took in from premiums on their individual plans.

On Wednesday, Humana Inc. became the latest of the big publicly traded companies to flag problems, saying its losses on individual plans deepened last year. Humana included in its 2015 results $176 million in losses it expects to incur on such plans in 2016.

Though the health law has added customers to many insurers’ rolls, much of that growth has been unprofitable, reflecting medical costs that have often run ahead of what insurers projected when they set premiums, among other factors.

The nonprofit Blues included in the regulatory-filings analysis—which was done by J.P. Morgan—had roughly $20.4 billion in individual-plan premiums over the first three quarters of 2015. Those enrollees incurred about $20.7 billion in medical claims. The result was sharply worse than a year earlier, when the premium total was larger than the claims payout.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, which estimated it had a loss of $77 million on individual plans for 2015, compared with a $66 million loss in 2014, said the “overall risk of people buying insurance on the exchanges is much higher than planned for,” in part because the law hasn’t attracted enough healthy enrollees. The insurer said such losses “cannot be sustained long-term.”

In an interview, Kevin Counihan, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law, said there were many new customers among the 12.7 million people who chose plans during enrollment for 2016, signaling that “the market is getting stronger; it’s going to be increasingly more attractive” for insurers.

In 2014, the year the health law’s marketplace plans launched, 70% of insurers lost money on individual plans in the end, McKinsey & Co. calculates.

There were some brighter spots; plans in a few states—notably California, which runs its own marketplace—produced profits. Some Medicaid-focused companies, such as Molina Healthcare Inc. and Centene Corp., have been profitable on the exchanges.

But for 2015, recent earnings calls by the largest publicly traded insurers—many of which reported strong overall results—have highlighted setbacks with the ACA business. Typically, the ACA plans represent a relatively small share of total revenue. Humana said it “continues to evaluate its participation in the individual commercial business for 2017.” The insurer has agreed to be acquired by Aetna Inc. in a deal awaiting antitrust clearance.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it had losses of about $475 million on its 2015 ACA-plan business, and booked $245 million of projected 2016 losses as part of 2015 results; it is considering withdrawing from exchanges.

Aetna said it saw a negative margin of 3% to 4% in 2015 on individual plans. Anthem Inc., which achieved profits on individual plans in 2014, fell back to roughly break-even in 2015, amid enrollment that came in below what it once expected.

The most dramatic signs of strain came from startup cooperative insurers launched by the health law, many of which closed their operations in the wake of losses last year.

Among the nonprofit Blues, the results in the state filings likely indicated overall loss margins of around 11% to 16% on individual plans in the first three quarters of 2015, once other expenses were factored in, said Gary Taylor, a J.P. Morgan analyst. He also said medical claims often tick up in the fourth quarter, for which state filings aren’t yet public.

In explaining losses on individual plans sold on the state health exchanges or the federal one, insurers have complained of higher expenses from consumers who sign up for coverage outside the annual open-enrollment period, often as they appear to need medical care. “We’re starting to see some issues of potential gaming of the system,” said Eric Earling, a spokesman for Premera Blue Cross. In its main market, Washington state, Premera was 8% in the black for its individual plans in 2014, but it swung to a roughly 6% loss in 2015.

Analysts said insurers themselves may have misfired in setting rates too low, either because they were hoping to grab market share or because they had little data on which to base their projections. “Some of it is based on insurers somewhat aggressively pricing this business,” said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.

The losses put a spotlight on 2016. “If 2016 is like 2015, we’ll have a real problem, because carriers could just start pulling out,” said Tom Snook, an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc.

Many insurers made changes for this year, including significant rate increases and paring of product offerings. Federal regulators have also made tweaks, including more limits on consumers’ ability to sign up for coverage outside open enrollment.

Mr. Counihan of the federal CMS said regulators are also looking closely at data about the off-season enrollees, and in situations where there “could be potential abuse, we’re going to address that and fix them.”

Some insurers are projecting improvement this year. Aetna is expecting to break even. Anthem has forecast a positive margin.

Other companies, echoing UnitedHealth and Humana, are already worried about 2016. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which estimates it lost more than $150 million on its individual business in 2015, is projecting a significant loss for 2016, said Roy Vaughn, a spokesman. That would come despite a rate increase of around 36.3% for this year’s ACA plans.

The insurer will need to seek another rate boost for 2017 “to try to get us to a level that makes it sustainable,” Mr. Vaughn said.",N/A,N/A,Wall Street Journal,02-10-2016,http://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-under-pressure-to-improve-margins-on-health-plans-1455154838,02-11-2016
0,‘Bad Hurt’ Film: A Family on the Verge,"Mark Kemble didn’t grow up on Staten Island, but the writer-director came to feel strangely at home there.

The filmmaker was raised in a working-class environment in Providence, R.I., the backdrop for his family memoir “Bad Hurt on Cedar Street,” first produced onstage in 2007.

But in the years it took to get the project financed as a movie, Mr. Kemble was led to the borough by Theo Rossi, a Staten Island native and former “Sons of Anarchy” star, who became essential to the film as producer and cast member.

Their drama “Bad Hurt” opens Friday at Cinema Village, starring Mr. Rossi, Michael Harney from “Orange is the New Black” and Karen Allen, who has adopted a lower profile since her “Indiana Jones” heyday.

The shorter title isn’t the only change. The emotional story of a troubled, blue-collar family fraying at the seams is now set in Staten Island. The film has become not only a semi-autobiographical account of Mr. Kemble’s upbringing, but an affectionate embrace of Mr. Rossi’s roots, as well.

“Theo’s mom was always making dinner,” said Mr. Kemble, who literally banked on the borough’s generosity to get the film made.

That included a lot of home cooking. “On the first weekend, the entire crew and cast of 85 people was there at my mom’s house, eating all this different New York-style food,” Mr. Rossi said.

It was his mother’s enthusiasm for the movie’s script that convinced the actor to help finance the production, drawing on the resources of many hometown friends.

The support of a tightknit community was crucial to making the low-budget effort, shot over 18 days during the brutal winter of 2014—whether it was getting snow shoveled or access to a shooting location.

“He just came off ‘Sons of Anarchy,’ ” Mr. Kemble said of Mr. Rossi. “People would pretty much give him want he wanted.”

Mr. Rossi had been inspired by the borough’s unified spirit in recovery efforts after superstorm Sandy hit in 2012. With the hit AMC biker drama behind him, the actor decided to leave Los Angeles and make his home on Staten Island, where he also runs Dos Dudes Pictures, his production company.

“I needed that New York mentality behind me,” he said, not only in regard to producing “Bad Hurt,” but also in a larger sense to his own place in the world. “There’s no way I could have made [the movie] anywhere else.”

Mr. Kemble’s screenplay, co-written with Jamieson Stern, draws poignantly on the story of the filmmaker’s family. The real-life elements aren’t always exact, but much revolves around Ms. Allen as Elaine Kendall, a mother struggling to temper a household of endless crisis.

Her daughter DeeDee (Iris Gilad) is a developmentally disabled adult whose romantic involvement with a likewise-challenged young black man causes flare-ups at home, mostly with her Irish-American father (Mr. Harney). An older son haunts the household, all but paralyzed by post-traumatic stress disorder from the first Gulf War. Middle sibling Todd (Mr. Rossi) works as a bus driver, but has bigger dreams he is finding hard to realize.

“I wanted to bring in the idea that people are walking around with a lot more pain than we give them credit for,” said the director, who compressed three decades of family material into a one-week time frame, set during Christmas week of 1999.

That resonated strongly with Mr. Rossi, who recognized similar emotions and circumstances from his Staten Island youth. He also appreciated the story’s intimate dramatic perspective, which he likened to films such as “In the Bedroom” and “Blue Valentine.”

“It wants to drag some sort of seesaw emotion out of you,” he said. “I was brought to this place where I thought, ‘My God, this is like my life.’ All I kept seeing is where I grew up.”

Ms. Allen, who has enjoyed a fruitful acting career in recent years—while also running a fiber-arts shop in western Massachusetts—was grateful for the realism.

“To be in the hands of someone who really knows these characters, and it’s not a fabricated world, is more appealing,” she said.

The movie also became an act of discovery.

“I lived in New York for most of my life and had never been to Staten Island,” she said. “It’s like a little world unto itself for me, so close and yet so far.”

For Mr. Rossi, who has been shooting in Brooklyn for the new Netflix series “ Luke Cage,” the sense of remoteness made the movie production something novel, if fleetingly so.

“[Staten Island] is the enigma of the five boroughs,” he said. “I think that benefited us. I see film trucks all the time now.”",N/A,N/A,Wall Street Journal,02-11-2016,http://www.wsj.com/articles/bad-hurt-film-a-family-on-the-verge-1455223547,02-11-2016
0,Democratic Debate Preview: Hillary Clinton Aims to Bounce Back,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet for their sixth debate on Thursday night in Milwaukee, in a contest set to be carried on PBS and CNN at 9 p.m. EST.

It will be their first meeting since Mrs. Clinton’s blowout loss in the New Hampshire Democratic primary on Tuesday. The forum also comes as her campaign re-evaluates questions about message, fundraising, and strategy after the 22-point defeat.

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign argues because the first two primary contests are in states that are whiter and more rural than the country at-large, they expect her to start winning convincingly in March, when states with larger and more diverse populations head to the polls.

But Mr. Sanders has shown that he has the financial support to mount a significant challenge that could go well into the spring, despite her lead in the national polls. In the 24 hours after his victory in New Hampshire, he raised more than $6 million online — a staggering amount of campaign cash in a short period of time.

The Democratic primary now moves to the south and the west: to Nevada, where the state’s Latino population plays an important role in the state’s caucuses and to South Carolina, which as a large black population active in Democratic politics.

Here’s what both candidates need to do on the debate stage tonight:

* * *

Hillary Clinton

Mrs. Clinton has frequently delivered strong performances in each of the previous Democratic forums, but her challenge going forward is to bring Mr. Sanders down to earth.

The Sanders campaign is riding a wave of positive media coverage after his New Hampshire finish that points to his strong support across nearly all demographic and income groups, his impressive grass-roots fundraising numbers and his increasing number of endorsements. His campaign message is built around the premise that he’s a fearless independent, who is not beholden to interest groups and who doesn’t practice politics as usual.

Mrs. Clinton will need to aggressively challenge that image and remind Democratic primary voters that Mr. Sanders is a politician — someone who has made unpopular compromises and cast difficult votes. She’s already hammered him on his vote in favor of granting gun manufacturers immunity — forcing his campaign into an awkward retreat last month. And she showed glimmers of that attack in a debate earlier this month that questioned his progressive credentials. She’ll now need to expend on that critique.

The other challenge for Mrs. Clinton is to keep her numbers up among African-Americans and Latinos, who will play a huge role in the Democratic primary going forward. She’ll likely make her commitment to racial equality and social justice issues a major topic going forward, including from the debate stage.

* * *

Bernie Sanders

Mr. Sanders has one major challenge in the coming weeks and months: expand his base. He’s popular among young people, liberals and white Democrats. Mrs. Clinton has bigger leads among black and Latino voters — but she’s also got nearly universal name recognition. Many Democratic voters are only starting to pay attention to the race.

These debates are his best opportunity to expand his coalition and peel away some of Mrs. Clinton’s support. He’ll need to introduce himself to voters who are just tuning in and explain how his economic vision for the country will help all Americans.

Some prominent African-Americans leaders have criticized Mr. Sanders for a narrow focus on economic issues. He’ll need to address that perception and speak specifically to the concerns of Latino Americans and African American voters.

And he’ll need to expand his foreign policy repertoire, especially in debates against a former secretary of state. He routinely brings up Mrs. Clinton’s 2002 Iraq War vote — a deeply unpopular issue among liberals that wins him points on the debate stage. But he’ll need to reverse the impression that he’s not as fluent or comfortable on foreign policy issues if he wants to be seen as a credible commander-in-chief.",N/A,N/A,Wall Street Journal,02-11-2016,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/11/democratic-debate-preview-clinton-aims-to-bounce-back/,02-11-2016
0,Imports Rebound at Southern California Ports,"The two busiest U.S. ports on Thursday reported slight growth in imports, the latest sign that many companies are holding back on spending as they wait for the economic picture to clear.

The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which form the largest port complex in the Western Hemisphere, reported a 37% jump in container imports from a year earlier, when both ports slowed to a crawl amid protracted labor negotiations. Compared to the same period in 2014, the ports’ combined volume only grew 1%. Exports were up 5% from last year but down 18% from January 2014.

January’s volumes show that West Coast ports have largely recovered from last year’s congestion. However, growth remains subdued as U.S. retailers and manufacturers have been slow to ramp up imports after the holidays, opting instead to work through large inventories built up last year. The strong dollar has reduced exports by making U.S. goods more expensive in foreign markets. Even so, Los Angeles port officials said it was their busiest January on record.

“Certainly they bounced back a lot from last year, but in the longer scheme of things, they should hold the champagne,” said international trade economist Jock O’Connell.
Los Angeles imported 367,209 20-foot equivalent units, a standard measure for container cargo, up from 259,206 last January. Long Beach handled 278,491 TEU of imports, up from 213,667 a year prior.

Los Angeles exported 126,241 TEU, up from 124,365 last January. Long Beach’s 106,739 was an improvement on last year’s 98,462.

Meanwhile, empty container movement continued to grow. Empties were up almost 25% from January 2014, and more than 37% from this month last year. Long Beach officials attributed the surge in empties to businesses returning containers that had been imported full of “post-holiday sales” items, now making the return trip to Asia. The Port of Los Angeles moved 210,949 empty TEUs in January, and the Port of Long Beach moved 150,958.

Some Southern California shipping businesses are bracing for an uptick in inbound cargo after the shuttering of the Outer Harbor Terminal in Oakland, that port’s second largest of five terminals. The port says it will direct cargo from that terminal to others nearby, but some analysts warn that could add to congestion.

However, Mr. O’Connell said much of Oakland’s imports are destined for local markets, and trucking them up from Southern California would potentially be too expensive.",N/A,N/A,Wall Street Journal,02-11-2016,http://www.wsj.com/articles/imports-rebound-at-southern-california-ports-1455222604,02-11-2016
0,Love Thy Neighbor’s House? Why You May Want to Buy It,"Every month for years, Heidi Cornell-McKenna paid $8,000 to her elderly neighbor in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. In exchange, she earned the right to buy the woman’s house when she died. Her neighbor died at age 100, and Ms. Cornell-McKenna closed on the house last February.

Adam Solomon and his husband “did a dance for a solid two years” with their next-door neighbors in Manhattan, with each couple hoping to buy the other out. Mr. Solomon said the Long Island City skyline view from their combined apartments was worth the roughly $15,000 over market value he paid for the place next door.

With larger spaces scarce in hot markets, some homeowners are finding creative ways to buy their neighbors’ properties, using persistence, charm and detective work to expand their empires without leaving the block.

“Our neighbors laugh and say ‘what were you trying to do—play Monopoly?’,” said Alexa Hampton, a 44-year-old interior designer who, with her husband, successfully purchased two apartments adjacent to their unit to create a roughly 3,500-square-foot spread.

The convenience of buying the property next door doesn’t come cheap. Purchasers can expect to pay at least 10% above the market rate—and sometimes much more, real-estate agents said. Premiums are especially high in hot property markets like New York City and Los Angeles, where space is hard to come by.

In December, actress and writer Tina Fey paid $9.51 million—roughly $2 million over the asking price—for the apartment above hers on New York’s Upper West Side. Last year, film producer Megan Ellison, daughter of software billionaire Larry Ellison, plunked down $5.25 million for the house next to her $30 million estate in the Hollywood Hills. And in 2014 nighttime talk show host Jimmy Fallon bought a fifth apartment in his New York City building, where he bought his first unit in 2002.

The chase can take years. Mr. Solomon, a 31-year-old agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, and his husband longed to buy their neighbors’ unit, which shared their view of Long Island City’s Pepsi-Cola sign. But the neighbors, a couple with a small child, rebuffed Mr. Solomon’s offer to buy it.

Then, about a year later, the neighbors turned the tables, offering to buy Mr. Solomon’s apartment. He countered, and eventually bought the neighbor’s apartment for $915,000, a price he thinks is about $15,000 over market value. After combining the units, he lives in a 1,900-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, 2½ bathrooms, a den and a laundry room. Best of all, he said, “every room has the same view.”

Jeff Thomas also had to be patient. In 2012 Mr. Thomas, a real-estate developer and owner of car dealerships, bought a 4,000-square-foot house with views in Los Angeles’s Hollywood Hills for $4.25 million with real-estate agent Paul Blair of the Agency. Mr. Thomas wanted to expand, but found that local laws wouldn’t let him unless he had more land.

About six months after he moved in, the house next door came on the market. Mr. Thomas put in an offer, but the property sold to a higher bidder for $2.25 million. About two years later, Mr. Thomas approached the owners through a friend and asked them to name their price, then quickly agreed to their ask of $2.7 million.

Throughout, Mr. Thomas, 50, kept his identity as their neighbor hidden. “If they feel they have a captive buyer, who really wants or really needs this property, it’s just human nature to try to get as much as they can out of this guy,” he said. He now plans to demolish both homes and build a 17,350-square-foot house with four bedrooms plus staff quarters, an infinity pool and a roof deck with views. The new home would likely be worth $20 million to $30 million, according to Mr. Blair.

Sometimes convincing neighbors to sell requires finding them a new home. “People get very creative for a little extra square footage,” said real-estate agent Nada Rizk of Brown Harris Stevens.

The Manhattan apartment purchased by actress Tina Fey and her husband in December. The couple paid $9.51 million for the apartment, which is directly above another unit they own.
Heidi Cornell-McKenna in the Hollywood Hills home she bought from her neighbor.
Soon after buying her house in 2007, Ms. Cornell-McKenna started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. “I had a vision of a compound,” she said.
She got to know her neighbor, a woman in her 90s who had lived there for decades. When the owner’s family visited on Sundays, “I would tell them, ‘I would love to have this house one day,’” Ms. Cornell-McKenna recalled. “I would love it for my mom.”
Ms. Cornell-McKenna also worried that someone would tear down the neighbor’s house and rebuild. “It would be awful having to share that driveway with someone tearing down their house,” she said. “I would have nightmares thinking, ‘someone’s going to buy this house.’”

But Ms. McKenna wasn’t sure she could afford to buy the neighbor’s house, and her neighbor needed money to pay her expenses. Eventually they came up with a creative solution: Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn’t close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month, with the payments subtracted from the final purchase price.
The arrangement ended working out for everyone: The neighbor got to stay in her home, and when she died two years later, Ms. McKenna was able to close on the house.

Royce Pinkwater, founder of the real-estate investment brokerage company Pinkwater Select, described one Manhattan combination she orchestrated last spring as “the most complicated deal I’ve ever done in my career.” For clients who wanted to expand their three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment, she hired an investigator to find the contact information for the owners of the two-bedroom apartment directly below theirs. To convince the neighbors, an elderly couple, to sell, she had to find them another apartment in the building and offer them $6.5 million, about 20% over market, for their unit. Then after the closing, her clients had to wait months for the couple to renovate their new apartment before moving out.

After all that, Ms. Pinkwater’s clients changed their minds, and both units are now on the market for a total of $19.25 million.

Ms. Cornell-McKenna, 49, founder of the lifestyle brand Young Fabulous & Broke, purchased her Hollywood Hills house, with a view of Century City and the ocean, in 2007. Almost right away she started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. “I had a vision of a compound,” said Ms. Cornell-McKenna, who at the time was a single mother. About five years ago, she started saving money to purchase the house, creating an LLC called “1423 Devlin Drive,” after the property’s address.

Then her neighbor—a woman in her 90s who Ms. Cornell-McKenna had befriended—looked into getting a reverse mortgage on the home to help pay her expenses, but couldn’t get one. In 2012, with advice from Douglas Elliman agent Tracy Tutor Maltas, Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn’t close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month. The payments would be subtracted from the home’s price, and when the neighbor died, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would have 60 days to close.

The arrangement was “a risk,” Ms. Cornell-McKenna said, because she wasn’t sure how long the neighbor would live or if she’d have enough money saved when it came time to close. It ended up working out: The neighbor lived for two years before dying at age 100, during which time “my company did better and better,” Ms. Cornell-McKenna said. She closed on the home in February of 2015.

Real-estate agents caution that bigger isn’t always better. Before making plans to combine two properties, buyers should make sure the combination won’t create an awkward layout, which can hurt the home’s value, said Ms. Pinkwater. “There are combinations that happen that should never have happened,” she said. “It has to make sense.”

If it works, a combination can provide better value, especially in markets where real-estate values have appreciated rapidly. When Stacy Rauen, 37, editor of Hospitality Design magazine and founder of the prenatal beverage Bump Water, found out she was pregnant with twins in the spring of 2014, she was living in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her husband and their toddler son. With one new baby, “we could have made it work,” she said. “But not with two of them.”

They started looking around for larger apartments and were disappointed with the options. “To get a three or four-bedroom, we were kind of priced out of what we wanted,” she said.

The apartment upstairs seemed like the solution—it was on the market and had the same layout as theirs for an easy combination. But by the time the Rauens found out about the twins, it had gone into contract. So they made an offer on a three-bedroom in another building, which was accepted.

Then the unit upstairs fell out of contract. Ms. Rauen’s husband knocked on the upstairs neighbor’s door one Sunday night and offered to buy the apartment for just under the asking price. The neighbors agreed, and the Rauens retracted their offer on the other apartment. They paid $1.645 million for the unit plus a parking spot and private rooftop patio.

After the closing, the Rauens spent about $200,000 to combine the spaces into a four-bedroom duplex with a playroom and a “mini-mudroom” with space for two strollers. They finished the week before Ms. Rauen gave birth.

Combining the two apartments made getting a mortgage a little more complicated than they expected, she said, which delayed the closing by a few weeks. Another quirk of the setup is that they have two separate electric and cable bills.

But because they’d purchased their original apartment in 2011 for $749,000, even with the renovation the total cost was still less than the other apartment they’d made an offer on, which had less living space and fewer amenities.

Plus, she added, “We were able to make something that fit exactly how we wanted to live.”",N/A,N/A,Wall Street Journal,02-11-2016,http://www.wsj.com/articles/love-thy-neighbors-house-why-you-may-want-to-buy-it-1455203141,02-11-2016
0,L.A. County health officials want you to eat smaller portions at restaurants,"We’ve all heard it before: Too many Americans, more than one out of three, are obese, making them more likely to suffer from diabetes, stroke and heart disease.

But what can be done about a problem that’s so deeply ingrained in our culture? What people eat comes down to a complicated mix of preferences, location, access and behavior.  

In New York, Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to outlaw super-size sodas. Several years ago, the Los Angeles City Council banned new fast-food restaurants in parts of the city. The city of Berkeley passed a soda tax. 

Now, in another attempt to reduce obesity rates, the Los Angeles County Public Health department is launching an advertising campaign to encourage parents and their kids to choose smaller portions and healthier foods the next time they eat out. 

Though California has the fifth-lowest adult obesity rate in the nation, it has the highest obesity rate among low-income kids ages 2 to 4, with nearly 17% who are obese. Approximately 15% of all California kids are obese, according to national data.

L.A. County’s campaign message is simple: When eating out, eat less. And it doesn’t matter where you’re finding your next meal.

“Everyone points their fingers at fast food,” said Dr. Paul Simon, the department’s director of the Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention, but “we’re missing the boat to some degree when we let other restaurants off the hook.”

Even meals at sit-down restaurants tend to be packed with calories, salt and fat, he said. 

The ads, which began running Thursday and will continue through mid-March, will appear in Metro stations and trains, MTA buses, as well as radio stations and on social media, Simon said. They’ll be in English and Spanish, with some also in Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese, he said. 

In one advertisement, a young girl holds a menu, next to “Tip #1 for eating out: Choose milk or water every time.” Another reads: “Tip #2 for eating out: Choose fruits or veggies on the side.”

Obesity is one of the biggest battles public health officials face. Rates have skyrocketed in America, from 15% in 1980 to 35% in 2010.

High obesity rates among children are particularly worrisome because they’re showing signs of diseases once seen only in adults — diabetes and liver damage — and they’re developing habits that could keep them unhealthy for the rest of their lives, Simon said. 

“There’s clearly a need to intervene early ... to turn the curve on obesity and diabetes,” he said. 

In October, the health department launched a different ad campaign called Water: The Healthiest Choice. In one poster, a young boy sips on a red straw, his face partly covered by the words “WARNING: Soda, sports & juice drinks can lead to childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes.”

Experts say there’s no easy solution to obesity, which is driven by eating and exercise habits that are closely linked to people’s lifestyles. That makes ending the epidemic as much of an uphill battle as tackling smoking was in the 1960s and 1970s, Simon said.

“The poster child for this is, of course, tobacco, where, over the course of 30 years, we really changed the norms around smoking,"" he said. ""It’s going to be very challenging, but we’re trying to change those norms around eating patterns as well.”

The new L.A. County ads don’t discriminate between types of restaurants. Research shows that kids consume about a third of their calories outside the home, and that it’s not just fast-food restaurants parents need to worry about.

One study found that at sit-down chain restaurants, meals contained 1,128 calories on average, more than half of the average daily 2,000-calorie recommendation for an adult. 

Another study evaluated the calorie totals of meals at small chains and independent eateries, with similar results: too many calories. 

“People are consuming far too many calories in a given meal,” Simon said.

He said he knows it can be difficult for restaurant owners to cut back on tasty yet unhealthy ingredients or scale down portion sizes and not lose customers.

But Kevin McCarney, founder of Mexican restaurant chain Poquito Mas, said he doesn’t view these adjustments as giving customers less, but just giving them more options.

In addition to the classic burritos, tacos and tostados sold at Poquito Mas, customers also can buy smaller versions, called “Petitos.”

“The customer doesn’t have to choose between not having a burrito ... and having a burrito and having too much food,” McCartney said. “The idea is that sometimes people just want the craving of the food, that flavor, but we don’t want all the food.”

Poquito Mas is one of several establishments designated as “Choose Health L.A.” restaurants by the county health department. The dozens of restaurants that have qualified must offer smaller portion options as well as fruits and vegetables as sides for kids.

At a news conference Thursday unveiling the new ad campaign, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis made a plea to Latino families, who tend to suffer from higher rates of obesity and diabetes.

Solis, who represents the San Gabriel Valley and much of East L.A., asked that parents think twice about what they’re feeding their kids. Her mother and father, she said, always made sure she had a glass of milk with her meals, and tried to not use too much oil when cooking. “Those are good things about our culture,” she said. “We know that we can do better.”",N/A,N/A,LA Times,02-11-2016,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-restaurant-health-20160210-story.html,02-11-2016
0,President Obama: 'It's not like I've changed' since entering politics,"President Obama was addressing the Illinois General Assembly, but the dogged Statehouse press corps was not there.

From the gilded balcony of the cathedral-like House chambers, I phoned an old reporter friend from when we both covered the community organizer turned state senator.

“I didn’t go up to the floor to hear him speak when he was a lawmaker,” said the veteran, who listened to Obama's speech from the basement press room. “Why would I come up there now?”

As the only White House correspondent who watched Obama launch his political career here in 1997, people ask me all the time: What did people think of him back then? Did he take the place by storm? When did you realize he would be president?

Honestly? Few people knew him. He kept a low profile for most of his eight years. He was just a new lawmaker in the minority party with zero involvement in the hidden machinations of the Capitol.

In conversations Wednesday in his private cabin on Air Force One as he flew to Springfield — a native son returning to his political roots — and then later in a chat with three former legislators, Obama said that while America’s political culture has grown meaner and more partisan, he has not.

“It’s not like I’ve changed,” he said. “I’m the same guy now that I was then.”

He added, “I’m no more cynical. I’m not more ideological. My positions are surprisingly consistent.”

After he first entered the White House in 2009, he said, “I would invite a number of Republican senators… to come over to the White House for movies or some other events.”

But increasingly, he complained, “it was hard for them to do it without getting in trouble” with others in the GOP.

He made clear he missed the anonymity of being a backbencher in a prairie capital, the days when he could drive his beat-up Jeep to the Diary Queen and, as he joked, build up a college fund for his daughters, Malia and Sasha, by fleecing his colleagues in poker.

“I took them for all they were worth,” he boasted to laughter.

His secret? “I would just nurse my beer and these guys — you know. So the longer the game went on, the looser their betting got,” he claimed.

It was also a time when, his friends agreed, he could bring warring political factions together in backrooms to strike a deal, when he wasn’t lampooned or lionized by people who didn’t know him.

The truth is few in the Statehouse took note of Obama during his years here.

I came to know him, but only because my newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, was devoted to uncovering flaws in the Illinois capital justice system. Obama, a constitutional lawyer who also focused on the problem, was valuable to us.

Still, it took years me to realize he might one day rise in politics — possibly even to mayor of the city of Chicago. And that insight came only after Democrats took the majority in the state Senate and he began to call some shots.

As I traveled and talked with Obama on his return to Springfield, I realized how much his anonymity worked for him then — and how it informed his view that Americans are not as divided as our politics would suggest.

When he sat down with three old friends — former senators who showed him the ropes in Springfield — he talked about all they got done outside the public spotlight.

They fostered friendships, discussed their daughters and looked for common ground. They didn’t become punching bags on cable news or talk radio.

After he got to Washington, he recalled, “I had very good relationships and friendships with some of the same people now who can’t take a picture with me. It wasn’t like I changed.”

I listened as they reminisced about passing state laws to reform campaign finance and capital justice. Obama also won bipartisan support for a bill to make police more aware of the role that race may play in law enforcement.

I suddenly recalled a moment with Obama outside the Statehouse press room, sometime in 2002. I’d accosted him with a tape recorder to ask about his closed-door meetings with law enforcement officials to talk about racial profiling.

He smiled and said he’d let me know when he had something to tell me.

I pressed. A liberal black lawmaker from Chicago? Shouldn’t he want to vent about the system? Especially to his hometown paper?

He dug in. He’d talk to me, I remember him saying, but not then.

I stormed off to talk to somebody else. Someone who was going places.",N/A,N/A,LA Times,02-11-2016,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-personal-20160211-story.html,02-11-2016
0,"On the eve of Pope Francis' arrival in Mexico, not everybody is so welcoming","As Mexico prepares for the Friday arrival of Pope Francis, not everyone is looking forward to the visit.

How much the trip is costing — and whether that money would be better spent combating poverty, disease, unemployment and other problems the Pope himself has championed — has become a vibrant debate in a country where more than 80% of the population is Catholic.

One newspaper, Milenio, estimated that state and municipal governments will have spent nearly $10 million by the end of the six-day visit.

One Twitter user, Luisa Grisales, cited that estimate in a tweet, saying it would be better spent on education, health and creating jobs.

There is an economic upside too, of course, as tourists flock to the stops along the pontiff's path and spend millions of dollars.

And the visit won't be entirely funded by the government, as businessman Carlos Slim, the world’s second-richest man, and several companies have donated to the cause, according to the magazine Proceso.

Still, the hashtag #YoNoQuieroQueVengaElPapa (“I don't want the Pope to come”) has been showing up on Mexican Twitter accounts.

“Why do we want the pope here? one tweet asked. ""The people can't eat hope.” 

Other critics of the trip wanted to know: Why won’t Pope Francis be meeting with victims of sexual abuse by clergy? Will the visit draw much-needed attention to the country's problems, or is it just a diversion from poverty and other problems?

“For a few days, people will be happy about the Pope, but then it's back to reality,” said Armando Rios Lopez, a 52-year-old shop owner.

That kind of thinking spanned people of all generations.

“I would prefer that all of that money be spent on health, on education, in this country that's dying of hunger,” said Claudia Sanroman, a 22-year-old student.  “This visit from the Pope won't help us with anything. The visit from the Pope only helps the politicians who are going to be photographed with him.”

Another Twitter user suggested another use for the money spent on the pontiff's visit: supporting a visit to Mexico by the singer Bjork.

Other opponents just think the visit will be a hassle. A video on the website Chilango.com detailed the inconveniences Mexico City residents would be forced to endure: metro stations shut down; streets blocked; markets, gas stations and even bike rental stands all closed.",N/A,N/A,LA Times,02-11-2016,http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-pope-twitter-20160210-story.html,02-11-2016
0,Obamajam is returning to L.A. -- here's how bad it's going to be,"As President Obama swings through Southern California this week for political fundraisers and an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’ daytime TV show, motorists in Los Angeles are bracing for heavier-than-usual traffic.

After attending fundraisers in the Bay Area, Obama is scheduled to arrive in L.A. on Thursday for a taping of “Ellen” in Burbank. The interview will air Friday.

Next, the president is also scheduled to attend fundraisers in Hancock Park organized by the Democratic National Committee.

After spending the night in L.A., Obama will decamp Friday to the Coachella Valley, traveling to Palm Springs and later Rancho Mirage. There he’ll host leaders from Southeast Asia for a two-day summit starting Monday at Sunnylands, the 200-acre estate formerly owned by the Annenberg family.

On Thursday, several roads across L.A. County will be shut down for the presidential visit, according to the Los Angeles Police Department:

0,Missing woman's body had been in car at Wal-Mart since December,"Since November, family and authorities tried to find Lauren Jessie Moss.

She had gone missing, and officials in Monterey County said they could not find her — until this week.

Investigators said they found Moss inside a car that had been parked outside a Wal-Mart store in Salinas for months.

Police checked video footage and saw the car had been parked there since December, KSBW-TV reported.

Moss was last seen in Seaside on Nov. 13, the same day she left a rehab center.

Salinas police officers said her death was likely a suicide.

Police say Moss' car had dark tinted windows and a sunshade over the dashboard, making it hard to spot anyone inside.

A 51-year-old man walking along Nostrand Avenue near Glenwood Road in Flatbush was forcefully knocked to the ground by a 6-foot-1 black man around 3:40 p.m. Monday, police sources said.

The victim told investigators that the assailant shouted, “This is for Malcolm X, cracker!” as he fell to the ground, sources said.

The man suffered pain in his neck, back and left shoulder, but refused medical attention at the scene.

Police are also investigating another possible bias attack on Sunday involving a man who allegedly sucker-punched straphanger Randy Aveille, 44, at the Church Avenue subway station at 9:45 p.m. Feb. 5 and spewed racial hatred at him.

Cops released surveillance video of Aveille’s attacker on Wednesday in hopes of tracking him down.

Authorities are investigating whether the attacks are related, sources said.

Aveille told The Post on Sunday that he had just gotten off the subway with his girlfriend and was headed to the steps when a man came from behind and began pummeling him in his face.

“I was blindsided by a guy who started hitting my face,” Aveille said. “I was walking, and as I was approaching the steps, somebody came from behind me.”

0,Dozens dead in brutal riot at Mexican prison,"MONTERREY, Mexico — Fifty-two inmates were killed and 12 injured in a brutal fight between two rival factions at a prison in northern Mexico on Thursday, the state governor said.

Nuevo Leon Gov. Jaime Rodriguez told a news conference the fight involved a faction led by a member of the infamous Zetas drug cartel.

Rescue workers could be seen bringing injured inmates from the Topo Chico prison in Monterrey, at least some with burns.

The riot broke out just six days before Pope Francis is scheduled to visit another Mexican prison, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua state.

Images broadcast by Milenio Television showed flames leaping from the prison, with a crowd of people bundled against the cold gathered outside. Some shook and kicked at the prison gates, demanding to be allowed in.

The fire appeared to have been extinguished by shortly after sunrise.

Witnesses said the fire broke out at about 12:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EST) amid shouts and sounds of explosions. A thick cloud of smoke rose, apparently from inmates burning mattresses.

Mexico’s official National Human Rights Commission reported in 2013 that the country’s prison system is plagued by violence and cases of inmate control, symptoms of corruption and lack of resources.

The report, based on visits and interviews at 101 of Mexico’s most populated prisons, found that 65 of the facilities were run by inmates, not authorities.

In one of the worst incidents in 25 years, 44 inmates died in a prison massacre in February 2012 in Apodaca, Nuevo Leon. After the incident, three top prison officials and 26 guards were accused of helping inmates escape in the confusion.",N/A,N/A,New York Post,02-11-2016,http://nypost.com/2016/02/11/riot-fatal-fire-break-out-at-mexican-prison/,02-11-2016
0,Ronda Rousey takes first step toward Holly Holm revenge,"It looks like Ronda Rousey is officially blazing the comeback trail as she gets back in the gym for the first documented session with her coaches since a November 2015 loss to Holly Holm.

TMZ captured the former champion working mitts and throwing combinations with coach Edmond Tarverdyan at the Glendale Fighting Club in California this week.

Rousey had stated following a vicious head-kick knockout to Holm last year that she may not be able to take any kind of impact for “three to six months”— but it looks like she’s at least ready to start throwing hands again.

Rousey hasn’t been out in the public much since her loss to Holm outside of a couple of appearances and her recent stint on “Saturday Night Live”. There’s no telling if she’s had any private training sessions since the fight with Holm, but from the kind of schedule she’s been keeping outside the cage, Rousey has been very busy.

The former women’s bantamweight champ has been focused on her acting career over the last few months where she has a couple of upcoming film roles in the “Road House” remake as well as “Mile 22” alongside Mark Wahlberg. It was actually filming “Road House” that forced Rousey to make the call that she would be unable to return at UFC 200 in July for a rematch with Holm.

The UFC ultimately decided to scrap that plan all together and put Holm in a title fight against Miesha Tate instead at UFC 196 on March 5.

Rousey hasn’t personally made any comment on when she hopes to return to action although UFC president Dana White said last week that he expects the former champion to likely get back in the Octagon around November to take on the winner of the Holm-Tate fight.

From the look of things, Rousey is at least starting to get fight ready for her eventual return to the UFC later this year.",N/A,N/A,New York Post,02-11-2016,http://nypost.com/2016/02/11/ronda-rousey-takes-first-step-toward-holly-holm-revenge/,02-11-2016
0,Jurors in police stairwell-shooting trial pore over evidence,"Jurors in Peter Liang’s Brooklyn manslaughter trial are digging into the evidence on their second full day of deliberations Thursday — requesting that a second, massive white board be wheeled into the deliberations room as the lunch break was called.

That’s in addition to the similar, 5-by-3-foot white board they started deliberations with.

Liang — on trial for the accidental shooting of unarmed Akai Gurley in a dark stairwell inside East New York’s Pink Houses stairwell — has remained cloistered in a small conference room on the second floor of Brooklyn Supreme Court, as Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association delegates mill around outside the door.

His attorneys have shuttled back and forth into the courtroom, as Gurley’s family waits with bated breath on the same floor during the nearly 13 hours that the jurors have deliberated since they began late Tuesday.

On Wednesday, jurors heard the charges read back, and then listened again to the 911 recording and police radio audio from from the night Gurley died.

Each juror then held and tested the trigger on Liang’s unloaded 9 mm Glock, turning it over in their hands and feeling the 11 1/2 Ibs of force necessary to discharge the weapon.

They also requested Wednesday afternoon to have portions of testimony of Liang’s partner officer Shaun Landau, and Gurley’s girlfriend Melissa Butler, read back.

0,Morgan Stanley to pay $3.2B to end mortgage probe,"Morgan Stanley is paying $3.2 billion — the largest fine in its history — to settle claims that it sold soured mortgage-backed bonds in the run up to the financial crisis.

The Wall Street bank peddled the securities to investors even though traders knew many of the underlying home loans were underwater, according to the settlement with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Traders openly bragged about using “magic” to make the bonds look better than they actually were, according to the settlement released on Thursday morning.

Under the terms of the deal, the state will get $550 million to help community rebuilding efforts, the AG’s office said.

“Today’s agreement is another victory in our efforts to help New Yorkers rebuild in the wake of the financial devastation caused by major banks,” Schneiderman said in a statement.

Morgan Stanley, led by CEO James Gorman, is the latest bank to get fined over the sale of busted mortgage-backed securities. Last month, Goldman Sachs paid $5 billion to settle similar charges.

“We are pleased to have finalized these settlements involving legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters,” according to a statement from the bank. “The firm has previously reserved for all amounts related to these settlements.”

Shares of Morgan Stanley were down 3.3 percent, at $21.96, on Tuesday morning amid a broader market sell-off.

0,"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton debate Thursday in Wisconsin","After getting routed in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton will try to regain her footing in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination when she squares off with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a Wisconsin debate Thursday night.

It’s shaping up to be a longer fight for the nomination than many pundits first predicted.

“Plans to wrap this up in a hurry would only occur if there was a major change in the campaign,” Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff said after Sanders beat Clinton by 22 points on Tuesday. “It was such a drubbing, Sanders now requires a full looking over by Democrats. If it had been 8 points, everyone would’ve said, ‘Oh, it’s just the neighborhood effect.’ ”

The debate, from Milwaukee, will air at 9 p.m. on PBS stations and CNN.

Sanders, who has called for a political revolution, tapped into anger on the left to score his huge win. But now the contest moves south and west to states with more diverse populations and stronger base support for Clinton.

“Now we will take the fight to the entire country,” Clinton promised her New Hampshire supporters after conceding the state Tuesday night.

Trying to immediately dispatch New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign handed out news releases before her remarks touting her strong support in South Carolina — site of the next Democratic primary on Feb. 27. She is seen as having broader support than Sanders among African-Americans, who might make up nearly 60 percent of the Democratic turnout in South Carolina, Miringoff said.

Other contests come up quickly. The Democratic caucus in Nevada is set for Feb. 20. Then Super Tuesday comes March 1, when more than 10 states hold primaries or caucuses.

After her Tuesday loss, Clinton vowed: “No one will outwork me.

“It’s not whether you get knocked down. It’s whether you get back up,” she told supporters.

Sanders said he is the only candidate who can truly excite Democratic voters and generate a huge party turnout in the November election.

“What happened here in New Hampshire, in terms of an aroused and enthusiastic electorate ... that is what will happen all over this country,” Sanders said.",N/A,N/A,Newsday,02-11-2016,http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-to-debate-feb-11-on-pbs-cnn-in-wisconsin-1.11457273,02-11-2016
0,Source: Eric Garner grand jury calls NYPD cops to testify,"Two police officers present at the 2014 choking death of Eric Garner have been called to testify before a federal grand jury in Brooklyn that has begun hearing evidence, a source confirmed on Thursday.

The Justice Department has been investigating the death of Garner since a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo on charges of using excessive force.

Garner died after Pantaleo grabbed him around the neck during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes on July 17, 2014.

Experts have been divided on whether there is a legal basis for charges that the officer intentionally violated Garner’s civil rights during the arrest.

Calling witnesses before a grand jury is a significant development, but doesn’t necessarily mean an indictment will be returned. The source said the officers testified on Wednesday.

The start of testimony before a federal grand jury was first reported Thursday by the New York Daily News.

Stuart London, Pantaleo’s lawyer, said he had not been contacted by the Justice Department and was surprised to learn a grand jury was convened.

London also said he wasn’t sure if it was a “criminal prosecution grand jury” convened to get an indictment, or an “investigatory grand jury” designed to compile evidence that might end up issuing a report urging reforms in areas such as police training.

A spokeswoman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers declined to comment.

0,"Mark-Viverito, NYC council speaker, eyes Rikers Island shutdown","City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito called Thursday for an inspector general for the city Department of Correction, a reformed warrant system for petty crimes and a community-based criminal justice system — all with an eye toward shutting Rikers Island.

Her annual State of the City speech — titled “More Justice” and held at Samuel Gompers High School in Mott Haven, an impoverished South Bronx neighborhood — focused on curbing abuses at the Rikers Island jail complex.

“More justice, less revenge,” the Democrat said in an hourlong speech, quoting Gompers, a labor leader from a century ago. “Más justicia y menos venganza,” she said in one of her frequent shifts into Spanish.

“Rikers Island has come to represent our worst tendencies and our biggest failures,” Mark-Viverito told an audience of hundreds that included the mother of Kalief Browder, who committed suicide after three years of pretrial detention at Rikers beginning at age 16 after he was arrested on a charge of stealing a backpack.

“We must explore how we can get the population of Rikers to be so small that the dream of shutting it down becomes a reality.”

She also said she will urge the 51-member council this year to pass legislation creating an independent inspector general for the troubled city Department of Correction, similar to the monitor assigned to the NYPD.

The inspector general would “focus on systemic issues in the city’s jail system,” she said.

Mark-Viverito didn’t detail her proposal to purge old warrants for low-level crimes and help reduce the city’s 1.5 million active summonses, but said, “Old warrants for minor, nonviolent offenses have hung needlessly over too many people’s heads for far too long.”

She said she hopes the council will “create a system to clear old summons warrants for those who have spent years — even decades — out of trouble.”

Her speech was attended by dozens of fellow council members and members of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration.

Norman Seabrook, president of the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, told reporters afterward that he appreciated that Mark-Viverito was trying to make a difference, but challenged her goal of closing Rikers and questioned where the detainees would go.

“In order to make a difference, you have to sit down with everyone at the table,” he said. “You can’t just sit down with one side and say do this without talking to the people who have the experience in doing it.”

He said he agrees with the speaker’s sentiment that young men shouldn’t be jailed for minor crimes like being in the park after-hours.

The Department of Correction did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mark-Viverito’s two-year tenure at the helm of the City Council has been marked by efforts to reform the criminal justice system.

She also announced Thursday that she would seek to enpanel a commission lead by retired Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, a champion of court system reform, to “explore a community-based justice model.”

The group, which Lippman said afterward would be funded by his law firm and would not require public resources, would study ways to reduce pretrial detention rates and move adolescents and those suffering from mental illness out of Rikers.",N/A,N/A,Newsday,02-11-2016,http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/mark-viverito-nyc-council-speaker-eyes-rikers-island-shutdown-1.11460794,02-11-2016
0,"Rangers thriving despite injuries to Ryan McDonagh, Rick Nash","On Tuesday, Rangers center Derick Brassard had called the next quartet of games, including matches against the Penguins, Kings, Flyers and Blackhawks, “a turning point in our season.”

The Rangers, still missing injured top-pair defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward Rick Nash, completed the first step of the mission on Wednesday with a 3-0 shutout in Pittsburgh to extend their winning streak to four games. Next up, Los Angeles visits Madison Square Garden on Friday.

“The team’s playing pretty well together,” Brassard said. “We’re working hard, competing. Guys are stepping up at the right time . . . We just have to keep this thing rolling. We’re playing some really good teams this upcoming week. If we want to make the playoffs, we have to be good.’’

Playoff plans aside, the Rangers, who have won five straight at the Garden and are 20-5-2 at home, the third-best record in the league, will have to be very good to crown the Kings (32-17-3), who have surged into first place in the Pacific Division.

Since McDonagh, who had rediscovered his all-around game in the past month, departed with a concussion from Wayne Simmonds’ sudden left to the jaw midway through the first period last Saturday in Philadelphia, his teammates have risen to the task. They’ve allowed only two goals (one at even strength) in 8 ½ periods and an overtime.

“Anytime you miss some of your top people, it’s an opportunity for some other guys to step up,” coach Alain Vigneault said after Wednesday’s win. “The third goal that put the game away, Jesper [Fast] made a strong play to get to the red line to take the hit, and put the puck into the empty net. He knows he’s going to get crushed there. Those are the things you need to do to win games. ’’

The Fast-Brassard-J.T. Miller line was assigned to cover Sidney Crosby’s line whenever possible, and held them pointless, which was quite an achievement. “He makes something out of nothing, and being on the same page, all five guys, really helped us,” Miller said.",N/A,N/A,Newsday,02-11-2016,http://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/rangers/rangers-thriving-despite-injuries-to-ryan-mcdonagh-rick-nash-1.11461430,02-11-2016
0,Think housing in Denver is tight? Try Fort Collins,"Fort Collins has one of the tightest rental markets in the country — perhaps fewer than 250 vacancies across the city.

According to a report from RealtyTrac, Fort Collins ranked second nationwide among cities with the lowest vacancy rates, having only 0.2 percent of total residential properties classifying as vacant.

A normal city vacancy rate would be around 3 percent, RealtyTrac vice president Daren Blomquist said. Fort Collins' tight market signifies a healthy employment rate and a growing population.

""A common theme for cities with low vacancies is a very low unemployment rate, and Fort Collins comes in with half the national average, at just 2.8 percent,"" Blomquist said. ""But Fort Collins is also a college town, and a small one at that, which lends itself to even fewer vacant properties when you have a steady stream of students and employees coming in and providing a supply of buyers and renters.""

The report focused on nationwide residential properties based on data such as foreclosure status, owner occupancy status, and equity. California's Silicon Valley, too, logged a 0.2 percent vacancy rate, with about 858 of 443,387 properties open. The report found just 4,424 vacancies among metro Denver's 826,435 total residential properties for a 0.5 percent vacancy rate.

Richard Button, the executive director of the Everitt Real Estate Center at Colorado State University, said the existing stock of student-oriented housing in Fort Collins is already sparse, so by extension, the non-student market might begin to reflect it.

""In a way, rental is a more affordable way for people who want to live in Fort Collins. Just deciding to live here might mean choosing the rental market,"" Button said. ""What's problematic is the cost of housing here is much higher, so we might also see an out-migration to the surrounding communities because of that increase in pricing.""

Blomquist said a ripple effect of the 0.2 percent vacancy rate might mean people having to move further from where they work in order to find housing that's not only available, but also reasonably affordable.

""A lower amount of vacant homes is a good thing, but too much of a good thing presents challenges, one of which is affordability,"" Blomquist said. ""That 0.2 number indicates there's less supply than there is demand and that's going to push up rental and home prices and could make the market unaffordable for the people moving there for jobs.""",N/A,N/A,Denver Post,02-11-2016,http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_29505530/looking-rental-youll-have-look-hard-fort-collins,02-11-2016
0,Colorado gun shop owner charged with illegally selling guns,"DENVER (AP) — A Colorado gun shop owner who appeared on the reality show ""American Guns"" is accused of illegally selling firearms after losing his license.

U.S. Attorney John Walsh announced Thursday that 52-year-old Richard Wyatt was indicted by a grand jury on conspiracy and tax charges and dealing guns without a license Tuesday.

According to the indictment, Wyatt surrendered his license in 2012 for unspecified violations of federal laws and regulations. He allegedly continued to sell guns from his suburban Denver shop by conspiring with another gun shop that had a license. Prosecutors allege that after customers paid for guns at Wyatt's shop, they were sent to the other shop to fill out background-check paperwork and pick up the guns.

0,"EPA employee in charge of Gold King Mine knew of blowout risk, e-mail shows","The Environmental Protection Agency employee in charge of work at the Gold King Mine said he was aware of blowout danger at the site ahead of a massive August spill there.

Hays Griswold, the on-scene coordinator, wrote in an October e-mail to other EPA officials that he ""personally knew"" the mine could be holding back a lot of water.

""This is why I was approaching (the mine) as if it were full,"" he wrote of the day of the Aug. 5 release at the Gold King.

The revelation provides more indications the EPA likely knew of the potentially looming disaster at the mine before workers accidentally broke through its collapsed opening, which was holding back 3 million gallons of wastewater.

An agency internal review said operators believed water inside the Gold King was not very high because of draining at the site and based on seep levels above its opening. Those factors, officials said, made checking pressure appear unnecessary and hence it was never done.

Griswold's e-mail appears to directly contradict those findings and statements he made to The Denver Post in the days after the disaster when he claimed ""nobody expected (the acid water backed up in the mine) to be that high.""

""I personally knew it could be holding back a lot of water and I believe the others in the group knew as well,"" his e-mail said, adding that he was privy to at least some pressure behind the blockage.

The e-mail was provided Thursday to The Denver Post and other news outlets as part of a 73-page investigation released by Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources into the event just outside the town of Silverton.

The release sent wastewater carrying possibly more than 880,000 pounds of metals into the Animas River and cascading downstream through three states and two American Indian tribes.

""The fatal flaw in the whole plan,"" Griswold wrote, was that when workers began removing parts of the dirt and debris blocking the mine they were operating too low. That opened up a wall of water that could not be stopped.

Griswold told The Post his crew's main intention the day of the spill was to work on the adjacent Red and Bonita Mine and that they had just gone to investigate the Gold King.

They started to dig away the dirt at the Gold King portal, where, Griswold said, weak rock around the portal had been collapsing. And then the mine blew.

""All that was holding it back was the dirt. The dirt just wasn't going to hold,"" Griswold told The Post in the days after the spill.

The U.S Department of Interior, in an independent report by its Bureau of Reclamation, said the disaster could have been avoided if the EPA and its contractors used a drill to check wastewater levels inside the mine before digging with heavy machinery to open its clogged portal.

It also found the spill resulted from rushing with inadequate engineering know-how.

Republicans have been heavily critical of the EPA's internal probe of the spill and the DOI's report, raising questions about bias. The natural resources committee review came after its chair, Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, called for an investigation into the incident under his authority.

Bishop, who has long criticized the EPA, said the report by his committee confirms his worries about the previous Gold King inquiries.

""This report peels back one more layer in what many increasingly view as a pattern of deception on the part of EPA and DOI,"" he said in a statement Thursday. ""We will need heavier efforts to squeeze out the full truth. The agencies continue to withhold information requested by the committee.""

The resources committee report says the DOI, in particular, concealed mistakes by the EPA and has refused to provide key documents from their investigation.

Griswold's e-mail too calls into question the interior department's findings. He said specifics in the report about events and actions the day of the spill were inaccurate.

""The (report) implies we were in some kind of hurry to open the (mine),"" he wrote. ""This is incorrect there was no hurry or urgency involved.""

The EPA and DOI have pushed back against Republican assertions that their probes were incomplete.

""We're going to take a look at the report and will respond appropriately,"" Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokeswoman, said Thursday.

""Reclamation and its technical service center stand behind our peer-reviewed report,"" said Dan DuBray, a reclamation bureau spokesman.

Republican members of Colorado's congressional delegation called the natural resource committee's findings further proof that the EPA has not provided the whole picture on the Gold King spill.

Sen. Cory Gardner said he will continue to push for answers.

""I've contacted the EPA demanding answers multiple times since it dumped toxic waste into the Animas River more than six months ago, and have received inadequate responses,"" he said. ""It's time for the EPA to be fully transparent and held to the same standards it expects private companies to meet.""

Rep. Scott Tipton, whose constituency includes the southwestern Colorado communities hardest hit by the disaster, called for ""severe consequences.""

""The EPA has been caught deliberately deceiving the public in order to cover up the fact that it was aware of the risks at the Gold King Mine and yet did nothing, leading to the disaster,"" Tipton said. ""This is an outrage that cannot go unpunished.""",N/A,N/A,Denver Post,02-11-2016,http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29504957/epa-employee-charge-gold-king-mine-knew-blowout,02-11-2016
0,Cosby cases inspire Colorado bill for more time for victims,"DENVER (AP) — The sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby have inspired Colorado lawmakers to sponsor a bill to eliminate a statute of limitations to give rape victims more time to seek criminal charges.

A House committee hears a bill on Thursday to end the current 10-year statute of limitations.

Attorney Gloria Allred and two Colorado women who allege Cosby assaulted them decades ago planned a news conference.

The legislation isn't retroactive, so it wouldn't affect their claims should the proposal become law.

Dozens of women have accused Cosby of sexual abuse dating back to the 1960s. Cosby has consistently denied the allegations.",N/A,N/A,Denver Post,02-11-2016,http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29505115/cosby-cases-inspire-colorado-bill-more-time-victims,02-11-2016
0,U.S. stocks slide with global equities as Nasdaq 100 pares drop,"U.S. stocks fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing as much as 400 points, as investors shunned risk worldwide amid concern that central-bank efforts to support growth are losing their potency.

Equities trimmed losses, with energy stocks paring declines, after a report said OPEC is ready to cooperate on cutting production. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which earlier tumbled as much as 1.6 percent, fluctuated in late afternoon trading. Banks led the early retreat, with Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. falling more than 6 percent. Equities extended losses as Boeing Co. tumbled 8 percent after people familiar with the matter said regulators are probing its accounting.

Oil bounced off of its lowest level in 12 years after the Wall Street Journal reported that OPEC members may be ready to cooperate on reducing crude output. Crude climbed above $27 in New York after touching $26.13.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index dropped 0.9 percent to 1,835.06 at 2:55 p.m. in New York, headed toward the longest losing streak since September as it extended declines to a fifth day. The benchmark fell to the 1,810 level before rebounding. The Dow lost 204.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 15,710.59, after earlier falling to its lowest level since February 2014. Boeing's plunge knocked 54 points off the index.

""Central bank policies and the uncertainty around their effectiveness is the big macro concern right now,"" said Leo Grohowski, who helps manage more than $184 billion in client assets as chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. ""There's a large disconnect right now between what the Fed might do and what they're saying and what the market is expecting. There's a lot of Fed uncertainty back on the table reminiscent of late last summer.""

Signals by central banks from Europe to Japan that additional stimulus is at the ready are failing to ease worries that global growth will keep slowing. An initial rally in U.S. stocks evaporated in the final hour of trading on Wednesday as speculation that the Federal Reserve will hold off longer on raising interest rates gave way to renewed concern over the strength of the U.S. economy. Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congress yesterday that recent market turbulence may weigh on the outlook for the economy if it persists.

The S&P 500 is 14 percent below its all-time high set in May, near its lowest level in two years. The Nasdaq Composite Index is about 19 percent below its record set in July amid a more than 15 percent drop so far this year.

Declines in banks have been the biggest source of pain for U.S. equities in the market's latest rout — a gauge of financial shares on the S&P 500 has slumped almost 18 percent just this year, to its lowest level since 2013. With global stocks on the brink of a bear market, trading volumes remain high and volatility is on the rise.

""Energy companies have passed the ball to financials, because that's where they get their money,"" said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. ""When problems spring up anywhere, they inevitably find their way back to the financial sector.""

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 8.6 percent Thursday to 28.56, on the way to a five-month high. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX has jumped more than 56 percent this year.

The U.S. earnings season hasn't provided much of a relief even though more than three-quarters of companies that have reported so far have exceeded analysts' profit estimates. Some 21 members of the S&P 500 are scheduled to release financial results today, including American International Group Inc. and CBS Corp. Analysts estimate S&P 500 earnings fell 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter, and will continue to contract in the following two periods.

While the S&P 500's valuation of 15.1 times the forecast earnings of its members is in line with the average of the past five years, the measure has plunged 13 percent since the start of the year and is at the lowest level since October 2014. The gauge remains more expensive than developed markets in Europe, where the Stoxx 600 Index trades for 13.4 times estimated earnings.

All of the S&P 500's 10 main industries fell Thursday, with financial and industrial shares down more than 2 percent. Phone and consumer discretionary companies were the only groups losing less than 0.5 percent.

Banks in the benchmark are down 3.9 percent, headed toward the biggest one-day drop in more than five months. The group has lost nearly 12 percent this month, on pace for the worst in more than five years.

Losses in Boeing weighed on industrial shares in the S&P 500 as well as the Dow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of two of its best known jetliners, according to people with knowledge of the matter. General Electric Co. and Union Pacific Corp. lost at least 3.4 percent.

Cisco Systems Inc. rallied 10 percent, the most since May 2013, after predicting sales that may beat some analysts' estimates. The gains helped blunt some of the pain in the Nasdaq Composite. Also helping, Tesla Motors Inc. added 6.4 percent after assurances that it's on track with development of its long-awaited Model 3, while TripAdvisor Inc. surged 16 percent on a better-than-estimated quarterly profit. Expedia Inc. jumped 8.3 percent after forecasting earnings would grow as much as 45 percent this year.",N/A,N/A,Denver Post,02-11-2016,http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_29505750/u-s-stocks-slide-global-equities-nasdaq-100,02-11-2016

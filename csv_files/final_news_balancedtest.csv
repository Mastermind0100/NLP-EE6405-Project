0," In what football insiders are calling an unexpectedly severe punishment, the National Football League has sentenced the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to a year with the New York Jets for his role in the so-called Deflategate scandal. The punishment drew howls of protest from Patriots fans and management, with many calling it the harshest in league history, but N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell defended the decision as a necessary deterrent. We need to send the message that this league has zero tolerance for cheating, Goodell said. We believe that a year of playing quarterback for the Jets sends that message loud and clear. Brady was reportedly in a state of shock when he heard the news of his punishment. He later met with reporters in a hastily called press conference during which he frequently seemed on the verge of tears. I am going to fight this decision with every fibre of my being, Brady said. This is America. You cant force a person to play for the Jets. At a sports bar in Manhattan, the reaction to the impending arrival of the Jets longtime nemesis was muted. One Jets fan observed, Look, Bradys a dick, but even he didnt deserve this. "
0,"In a freak accident following Game 3 of the N.B.A. Finals, Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Matthew Dellavedova suffered fractures in all four of his limbs and neck, but said that he should be ready to play in Game 4, on Thursday. Speaking from an intensive-care unit at the Cleveland Clinic, the gritty Australian declined to dwell on the details of the accident, but said that he would not let the loss of his limbs and neck keep him out of Thursdays contest. Im not going to give less than a hundred per cent just because Im playing without a spinal column, said Dellavedova, who acknowledged that he also broke his spinal column. Cleveland coach David Blatt praised Dellavedova, calling him the kind of blue-collar steelworker lunch-pail smokestack guy who wont let a little full body cast slow him down. Blatt said that he anticipated another gutsy performance from his point guard in Game 4, noting that Dellavedova had played several games in college with a detached head. "
0,"North Koreas official news agency announced today that the militarys planned missile test had been put on hold because of problems with Windows 8. Intelligence analysts said that the announcement gave rare insight into the inner workings of North Koreas missile program, which until last year had been running on Windows 95. The announcement from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not indicate a new scheduled time for a missile test, saying only that it was working with Windows 8 support to resolve the issue. In the words of one intelligence analyst, That means the test has been delayed indefinitely. A source close to the North Korean regime reported that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is furious about the Windows 8 problems and is considering a number of options, including declaring war on Microsoft.

0,"The former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin would bring much-needed dignity to the 2016 Republican field, a new poll shows. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, Palins ability to articulate her positions on issues with precision and restraint is sorely lacking among other entrants in the G.O.P. race. Additionally, voters said that the former governors breadth of knowledge in the fields of economics, foreign affairs, and American history would place her head and shoulders above the current crop of Republican hopefuls. In the words of one voter who was surveyed, When I hear some of these candidates talk, I sure do miss Sarah Palin. Despite the overwhelming sense that she would contribute gravitas and intellectual rigor that have been woefully missing from the G.O.P. contest, a Palin candidacy appears unlikely, a spokesman said. Governor Palin is very flattered by this poll, but she is concerned that being associated with this field of candidates could harm her stature, he said.

0,"With the first Presidential debate just two days away, G.O.P. nominee Mitt Romney has been working intensively on two skills that have eluded him throughout the campaign: talking and thinking. According to one aide, much of Mr. Romneys debate preparation has involved rehearsing a slew of prepackaged zingers, with mixed results: We gave him what we thought was a foolproof line about the budget deficit and he somehow turned it into a crack about gay Mexicans. Reportedly, Mr. Romneys practice debates have gone worse than expected, with the former Massachusetts governor getting trounced by a variety of opponents, including the Apple personal assistant Siri. At a joint campaign appearance in Ohio today, Ann Romney attempted to lower expectations for her husbands performance at this Wednesdays debate: When Mitt starts working his mouth and goes off on some weird tangent about who knows what, please just tune him out. God knows thats how Ive survived all these years. Mr. Romney also downplayed his debate prospects, telling supporters: President Obama could very well be the greatest debater in human history. Hes Abraham Lincoln, Clarence Darrow, and the Roman orator Cicero put together. Next to that silver-tongued bastard Im going to sound like someone with a head injury. Later in the day, Mr. Romneys campaign released a statement apologizing to people with head injuries. "
0,"There are fans, and then there are super-fans. And 26-year-old Ricky Davis is definitely a super-fan. As a basketball-loving 90s kid, Ricky grew up wearing And1 apparel. In fact, Ricky loved their products so much that he recently spent over $100,000 on plastic surgery to look just like the And1 guy. And needless to say, the results were amazing: Wow! The process was lengthy and strenuous, as Ricky underwent 13 painful surgeries over more than two years to make his dream a reality. It began with doctors dying Rickys skin gray and using high-powered lasers to kill every hair follicle on his body. And it wasnt long before Ricky had a regulation-size basketball surgically implanted into his palm! That was just the beginning, however, as Ricky signed up for a highly experimental operation in which skin from his buttocks was grafted onto his face to effectively cover his eyes, nose, and mouth. And thanks to a number of organ donors, doctors were able to collect enough muscle to fill out Rickys torso, arms, and legs. All told, the surgeries took 26 months and cost Ricky $104,365. Incredible! Talk about commitment. Thankfully, Rickys fandom did not go unnoticed. Check out this tweet from And1 after they saw a photo of their No. 1 fan: Amazing. If youre a 90s kid, that has to be a dream come true! While doctors say Ricky has anywhere from eight months to a year of physical therapy before hell be able to walk again, we imagine itll only be a matter of time before hes wowing everyone on the basketball court in true And1 fashion! If Ricky still had a mouth, theres no doubt that hed say it was all worth it. Congratulations, Ricky. You truly are the ultimate And1 fan! "
0,"With its landmark decisions this week, the United States Supreme Court has sent the Republican Party scrambling to find entirely new bogus issues to pound away at during the 2016 campaign. With gay marriage and Obamacare effectively taken off the table, the Republicans now find themselves without a signature phony issue to disingenuously flog for the next sixteen months. But according to the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, the Party is already conducting an exhaustive search to find fresh new spurious positions to shamelessly distract voters during the upcoming campaign. Twenty-foot border fence, national voter I.D. cards, abolition of the I.R.S., mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds, Priebus said. Back at R.N.C. headquarters, weve got a wall of three-by-five cards filled with crap like that. Priebus acknowledged that the loss of Obamacare and gay marriage as issues had dealt a serious blow to the G.O.P.s supply of meaningless talking points, but he claimed that the Party would come back with even more insincere rhetoric than before. Anyone who thinks weve run out of b.s. is sorely mistaken, he said. Watch: An episode of Mary Norriss Comma Queen about the distinction between who and whom. "
0,"Koch Industries is defending its acquisition of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker against charges that it overpaid for the Midwestern politician. After co-owner David Koch revealed that Walker had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, he set off a firestorm of criticism that the company had spent too much for a worthless asset. There was absolutely no bidding war for Walker, an industry analyst familiar with the market value of politicians said. Even Sheldon Adelson had no interest in acquiring him. While Koch Industries did not disclose the purchase price of the Walker subsidiary, it said that Koch Industries would spend nine hundred million dollars between now and November, 2016, for a variety of upgrades to the Wisconsin governor. In a terse statement, Koch Industries argued, Scott Walker is a perfect fit with our diversified portfolio of elected officials, but indicated that, if Walker underperforms, the company would be open to selling him at a later date.

0,"Republican lawmakers asked increasingly tough questions today as they held another day of hearings to investigate, in the words of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California), Hillary Clintons suspiciously high poll numbers and what can be done to make them lower. With the help of Fox News, we have brutally attacked Hillary Clinton for months, and yet she remains more popular than ever, Rep. Issa said. This committee needs to know how that happened, and how we can keep it from happening in the future. Rep. Issa pointed to recent polls showing the former Secretary of State trouncing every potential G.O.P. Presidential candidate, even a skinnier version of Chris Christie. We demand an answer to one simple question, he said. What does Secretary Clinton know that none of us knows? In his boldest allegation of the day, Rep. Issa accused Secretary Clinton of cynically using her post as Secretary of State to become wildly popular with the American people. I invite her to these hearings to answer those charges, he said. Wrapping up for the day, Rep. Issa warned the former Secretary of State that he was just getting started: Once we Republicans decide to investigate someone, we dont stop. If Secretary Clinton doesnt believe me, she should ask her husband. "
0," In a poll taken on Tuesday night, a wide majority of Americans said that they now believe that they could be elected to the United States Senate. The results reflected a renewed sense of the inclusiveness of the American political system, as those surveyed said that they believed that anyone could serve in the Senate regardless of intelligence, the ability to speak, or any other qualifications whatsoever. While those responses indicated that, as of Tuesday night, at least, Americans were energized about the possibility of their future careers in Washington, other results were not so encouraging. Nineteen per cent of those surveyed said that they could not respond to the poll questions because they were still in a state of shock, while fourteen per cent agreed with the statement WTF??? "
0," In a positive development for the U.S.-led campaign of air strikes in Syria, a new poll indicates strong, broad-based support for the mission among people who have yet to read a news article about Syria. According to the poll, released on Tuesday, the bombing campaign got a thumbs-up from people who had no information about Syrias civil war, including its duration, the parties involved, and what a Sunni is. Additionally, the air strikes garnered enthusiastic support from people who could not correctly identify the President of Syria, tell what the acronym ISIS stands for, or locate Syria on a map. According to pollster Davis Logsdon, who supervised the survey for the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, the poll numbers augur well for the mission going forward. People who have not read a single article about Syria are a key constituency because they represent an overwhelming majority of Americans, he said. And when you asked the follow-up question of whether they intended to read an article about Syria in the future, their answer was a resounding no. According to Logsdon, the bombing campaign also earned high marks from another important group, Americans who think that they maybe read a news headline about Syria but did not click on it. "
0,"In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, National Rifle Association C.E.O. Wayne LaPierre warned that the N.R.A. would vigorously oppose any legislation that limits the sale, purchase, or ownership of politicians. Politicians pose no danger to the public if used correctly, said Mr. LaPierre, who claims to have over two hundred politicians in his personal collection. Everyone hears about the bad guys in Congress. Well, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a vote is a good guy with a vote. Im proud to be the owner of many of those guys. Mr. LaPierres comments drew a sharp rebuke from Carol Foyler, a politician-control advocate who has spent the past twelve years lobbying for stricter limits on the sale of politicians. Right now, a man like Wayne LaPierre can walk right into Congress and buy any politician he wants, she said. Theres no background check, no waiting period. And so hundreds of politicians are falling into the hands of people who are unstable and, quite frankly, dangerous. In addition to limiting the sale of politicians, Ms. Foyler said, it is time for society to take a look at the sheer number of politicians in the U.S.: Theres no doubt that we would be safer if there were fewer of them. For his part, the N.R.A. leader ended his testimony by serving notice that he would resist any attempt to take away the hundreds of elected officials he says are legally his. As if to illustrate that point, he clutched Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) close to his chest and bellowed, From my cold, dead hands. "
0,"Looking ahead to his final State of the Union address, Barack Obama told NBCs Matt Lauer that he was celebrating, just celebrating the last time I ever have to talk to these bastards. Ill be going over some of the accomplishments of the past seven years and outlining some of the challenges for our nation that remain ahead, the President said, in an interview taped for NBCs Today show. But inside, Ill be like, Good Lord, I never have to so much as look at these horrible people again. Asked which member of Congress he would most enjoy never looking at again, Obama responded, Thats tough. Its a toss-up between Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell. But the beautiful thing is, I dont have to choose, Matt. After tonight, I dont have to look at either of them. When Lauer reminded Obama that he might still have to engage in face-to-face conversations with McConnell during his final year as President, Obama visibly shuddered. God, lets hope not, he said. Over all, the President suggested that his ambitions for his final State of the Union were modest at best. Just to be able to look out at that sea of bastards for the last time everwell, it doesnt get sweeter than that, he said.

0," In the aftermath of Scotlands no vote in the referendum on becoming an independent country, Queen Elizabeth II, of Great Britain, took to the airwaves on Friday morning to inform the people of Scotland that she graciously and wholeheartedly accepted their apology. Although the matter of independence has been settled, one question remains very much open, she said in an address televised across Scotland. And my answer to that question is this: yes, I forgive you. The Queen made only scant reference to her obscenity-laden tirade on Thursday, in which she reamed the Scots for even considering breaking away from the United Kingdom. Like any parent with a naughty child, I became a little cross, she said. I forgive you for provoking me. The Queen ended Fridays address to the Scottish people on a conciliatory note. Let us all, each and every one of us, move forward now as one great nation, enjoying the benefits and the history of our glorious and historic union, she said. Even the forty-five percent of you who are wankers. "
0,"Shortly after world powers successfully negotiated a nuclear-framework agreement with Iran, Sen. John McCain warned that a lasting peace with the Middle Eastern nation could greatly limit our ability to bomb it. President Obama is hailing this framework as something that could enhance the prospects for peace in the Middle East, McCain told reporters at the United States Senate. For those of us who have looked forward to bombing Iran for some time now, that would be a doomsday scenario. The Iranians know well and good that if they abandon their nuclear program exactly the way weve asked them to, we can kiss bombing them goodbye, he said, shaking his head ruefully. Its a damn shame. As for President Obama, McCain added, Sometimes I think the President cares more about making the Iranians happy than about making the people who want to bomb the Iranians happy. With the deadline for finalizing a nuclear treaty with Iran set for June 30th, McCain said that there was still a chance that talks could break down and allow the United States to bomb it, but added, Im not getting my hopes up. If we all wake up on July 1st and were at peace with Iran, dont say I didnt warn you, he said. "
0,"Well, this was way too close. Representatives of Harrison Ford confirmed that the actor is recovering today after being compacted into a cube on a conveyor belt. Early reports say the 73-year-old Blade Runner star was almost entirely crushed along with a pallets worth of factory waste after slipping and falling onto the conveyor belt system. From what we know right now, Ford entered the office supply manufacturing facility early yesterday afternoon after having smelled what he thought was pie. He was then caught by a loose swinging winch crane and thrown onto the conveyer belt. Ford ducked a number of large spike rollers and several rapidly rotating gears before jumping clear of two industrial blowtorches by grabbing hold of a hanging catwalk platform. Then, having narrowly avoided the belts conveyor cleaver chopping mechanism, Ford was reportedly thrown with flailing limbs into the facilitys baler, where he was smashed flat twice like a pancake, at various points rolled into a tight ball, and finally smushed into a cube. The Star Wars A-lister was saved thanks only to a watchful foreman, who noticed Fords scared, blinking eyes squished together into a cube with the factory refuse. An ad hoc rescue team of workers was able to save Ford before he reached a white-hot incinerator, forklifting the actor down to the factory floor. Mr. Ford was found Tuesday compressed with his body broken into a neat cube, said a spokesperson from the manufacturing company. Thanks to the quick thinking of our employees, Mr. Ford was re-inflated with an industrial-grade air compressor before rescue workers even arrived. Fords family maintains that the star continues to keep his chin up. A tweet this morning from Fords son seems to confirm that the actor made it through his terrifying ordeal and will soon be back in fighting shape. Hope you feel better soon, Harrison! Were pulling for you. "
0,"The casino billionaire and Republican kingmaker Sheldon Adelson met several 2016 G.O.P. candidates available for purchase over the weekend, but decided to buy none of them, Adelson confirmed today. After hearing speeches by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and several others who were for sale, Mr. Adelson concluded that none of them are worth owning. I dont want to spend millions on another loser, said Adelson, who purchased both Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney in 2012. The casino magnate was scathing in his assessment of the candidates he declined to buy, calling them a third-rate grab bag of has-beens and dimwits. I guess the Republican Party is thinking, Here comes crazy old Sheldon, hell blow his money on the first washed-out wingnut we throw out there, Adelson said. Well, guess again. "
0,"Saying that he was horrified by a New York Times article recounting callous behavior on the part of Amazon executives, company founder Jeff Bezos warned today that any employees found lacking in empathy would be instantly purged. In an e-mail to all Amazon employees issued late Sunday evening, Bezos said that the company would begin grading its workers on empathy, and that the ten per cent found to be least empathic would be immediately culled from the herd. To achieve this goal, Amazon said that it would introduce a new internal reporting system called EmpathyTrack, which will enable employees to secretly report on their colleagues lack of humanity. The system will allow Amazon employees to grade their co-workers on a scale from a hundred (nicest) to zero (pure evil), resulting in empathy-based data that will be transmitted directly to Bezos. Then, through a new program called Next Day Purging, any employee found lacking in empathy will be removed from the company within twenty-four hours of Bezoss termination order. We cant be the greatest retailer in the world unless we are also the kindest, Bezos wrote in his e-mail. So my message to all Amazonians is loud and clear: be kind or taste my wrath. Love, Jeff.

0,"Well, this could have been really bad. According to his publicist, Harrison Ford was involved in a skydiving accident earlier today when he jumped out of an airplane with a backpack that turned out to contain a large steel ships anchor instead of a parachute. The alarmed Star Wars actor responded by frantically tugging his ripcord several times in hopes that a parachute was still hidden in the bag somewhere, but was only able to release a tractor, a 500-pound barbell, and a full-grown elephant. Witnesses say that a terrified Ford continued his plunge to the ground and smashed through a flock of ducks, which made a noise that sounded like bowling pins getting scattered. The incident reportedly left Ford covered in enough feathers that he could flap his arms as functional wings. The relieved and delighted actor used his newfound ability of flight to soar through the sky in elegant figure eights. Unfortunately, Ford then flew into a thundercloud and was struck by a lightning bolt. The electricity temporarily made his skeleton visible and charred all the feathers into ash. He only had time to glance at each of his featherless arms, look down, look back up, look down again, look back up, gulp nervously, and wave goodbye before gravity took effect and caused him to plummet earthward at even greater speeds than before. The movie star was helpless to stop his fall, unable to do anything besides pull out a giant scroll labeled Last Will & Testament and start filling it out with a fountain pen. Through a stroke of luck, the Hollywood legend landed directly on a telephone wire, which bent beneath him and gently slowed his fall until he touched the ground without injury. An exuberant Ford bent down and began kissing the earth in gratitude, but then the telephone wire straightened out and catapulted him into the sky again. Fords upward trajectory sent him smashing face-first into the metal underbelly of a jumbo jet with a deafening clang. After Ford peeled off the plane, a single pink, fleshy mound sprouted five inches out of the A-listers scalp, his teeth fell out one by one, and then he began falling a third time. On his way down, the Blade Runner star struck the top of the Empire State Building and began crashing through every floor of the skyscraper, leaving a Harrison Fordshaped hole through the entire structure. Representatives of the Empire State Buildings management company said that at the time of the accident, floors of the building had been rented out to businesses that included a cactus farm, a mousetrap factory, a piranha aquarium, and a store that only sold glass bottles of sulfuric acid. Miraculously, after crash-landing in the lobby and narrowly missing a priceless Ming vase on display, a weary and disheveled Ford was able to stumble out of the building on his own two feet. However, upon reaching the sidewalk, he was immediately flattened beneath the ships anchor as it finally hit the ground. Ford was then rushed to a nearby hospital in a sentient ambulance with a worried face. Fortunately, the actors family announced that he avoided serious harm and should make a full recovery. A tweet from Fords son indicates that the star remains in good spirits despite his ordeal. Were all rooting for you, Harrison! Get well soon! "
0,"Authorities were urging people to remain calm on Tuesday night after the broadcast of a chilling video that terrified millions. The video, which was broadcast nationally on CNN, appeared to show nine extremists glaring into the camera and making a series of escalating threats. The radicals increasingly violent rhetoric and palpable hatred rattled viewers across the nation, sources said. Experts who viewed the video acknowledged that the words and images contained in it were alarming, but advised the public to remain calm until the extremists threats could be authenticated. At this point, there is no reason to believe that any of these individuals are credible, one expert said. But such assurances did little to soothe viewers like Carol Foyler, of Kansas City, who watched the video in horror. These people are clearly dangerous and must be stopped, she said.

The Quaker Oats Company is apologizing for making a big-time error in an incredibly visible way: publishing the obituary of beloved actor Morgan Freemanwho is alive and wellon its oatmeal boxes. Ugh. Talk about an embarrassing screwup! Check it out below: By the time Quaker officials caught the mistake, it was too late. Not only were the boxes on shelves across the nation, but pictures of the obituary were already flooding social media, where thousands of posts are mocking the incident using the hashtag #QuakerOafs. Most of the reactions to the goof have been in good fun. Freeman himself even masterfully responded to the incident by posting a photo of himself eating a bowl of oatmeal to his public Facebook fan page. But based on the seriousness of this press release concerning the incident, Quaker apparently isnt laughing it off. The Quaker Oats Company made a major and regrettable mistake this past week when we published the obituary of noted actor Morgan Freeman. Occasionally, obituaries are written for people who are still living to use in the event of their death. Quaker had prepared one such obituary for Mr. Freeman, and it was erroneously printed on our oatmeal boxes. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused Mr. Freeman, his family, and his many fans. Sincerely, Paul Tenner, Director of Consumer Relations, The Quaker Oats Company Quaker is offering to exchange free boxes of oatmeal for the misprinted ones, but it isnt going to find many takers. The boxes have already become coveted collectors items, and a few have even started showing up on eBay for a pretty penny. Its okay, Quaker Oatseveryone makes mistakes. Just dont expect anyone to take you seriously when you publish your next obituary! "

Hes pretty much the king when it comes to shutting down people who peddle bad science, but this most recent case completely takes the cake: When an 8-year-old told the badass astrophysicist that she wanted to live on Jupiter, he completely shut her down using science. Amazing! How many times can Neil deGrasse Tyson win the internet? The epic science burn happened toward the end of one of Neils lectures at the Hayden Planetarium in New York last weekend. Third-grader Liza Collins was attending the lecture with her parents, and during the Q&A session, she raised her hand and told Neil that she wanted to live on Jupiter. But Neil wasnt about to let herand her bunk scienceoff the hook. What happened next was nothing short of pure NdT gold. Hold on, you want to live where? Tyson said. On a planet made entirely of unbreathable gases? One that doesnt even have a rocky surface you could stand on? A planet that would take you six years to even get to? Thats where you want to live? Because thats Jupiter. Enjoy your great new home! Needless to say, the girl had ZERO response! And of course, Neil didnt let it end there. After the event, the Cosmos host took to Twitter to really show Liza whats what. Awesome. Science FTW! First it was climate change skeptics, then it was the shaky physics behind Gravity and Interstellar, and now its 8-year-old Liza Collinsthey all prove that Neil deGrasse Tyson and science are literally the greatest things of all time.

Speaking from his Wyoming ranch, Cheney said that he had planned to remain quiet about the current state of affairs in Iraq, but thinking about those oil wells has kept me up at night. If Dick Cheney wont speak for the Iraqi oil wells, who will? he said. Cheney indicated that, as of now, there was no fighting near Iraqs oil wells, but warned, If the violence spreads, those wells could be in jeopardy. And its up to the international community to insure that that worst-case scenario doesnt happen.

When a lifelong football fan began to succumb to the final stages of terminal cancer, Roger Goodell visited him in the hospital and told him whos going to win the upcoming Super Bowl. Wow. What a beautiful way to say thank you to a lifelong fan. Way to go, Roger Goodell! Cleveland native Patrick Sorenson was diagnosed with leukemia toward the end of last year and quickly gained an internet following with posts on social media talking about his life, his illness, and his love for the game of football. When Goodell heard that Patricks condition was rapidly deteriorating, he decided to bend the rules a little and do something special for the 47-year-old Browns fan. So, he visited him in the hospital and told him how the game would end, right down to the final score. He even let him know who would be crowned MVP! What a guy. From what Roger Goodell told me today, Super Bowl 50 is going to be absolutely amazing, said Patrick shortly after hearing a summary of how the game would play out from the NFL commissioner himself. Being a football fan since I was a kid, it meant so much to be able to find out how it would end. I think you guys are going to love it! While everyone else has to wait until Sunday to find out who will win the big game, Goodell let Patrick sneak a peek at the game-day results, all out of the kindness of his own heart. And he timed it just right. Patrick passed away earlier this week, surrounded by friends and family. Its nice to know that he didnt leave us without hearing all the details of how Super Bowl 50 would turn out! Faith in humanity restored! "

When asked about the prospect of a debt-ceiling logjam leading to a downgrade of the U.S. economy, seventy-two per cent of those surveyed said that the new iPhone looks like the most awesome iPhone yet. Questioned about the disastrous impact of the U.S. government defaulting on the nations debt, sixty-five per cent agreed with the statement, I cant believe I waited on line all Friday for the 5s and they told me theyre sold out until October. On the topic of whether the debt-ceiling crisis could plunge the world economy into the most apocalyptic catastrophe since the financial meltdown of 2008, Americans were deeply divided over which color iPhone they would choose, but agreed that all of them looked amazing.

For the Taliban, who had just opened their office in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, the honor was totally unexpected and incredibly humbling, a spokesman for the group said. This is the first office weve ever opened, so naturally we wanted it to be nice and all, he said. But to be named a better place to work than Apple and Google and the other amazing places on this listwhoa. Cited in the poll was the atmosphere at Taliban headquarters, which numerous employees described as relaxed and fun. People think that just because we observe Sharia law, we walk around with frowny faces all day, the spokesman said. The fact is, we have a lot of laughs here. One person not amused by the survey results, however, was the Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who threatened to break off peace talks with the Taliban if they do not immediately admit that the poll was a total fraud. Who was behind this so-called poll? The Taliban, thats who, an angry Karzai told reporters. When they did their little ribbon-cutting for their office on Tuesday, I thought they were publicity whores, but they are really taking it to a new sick level. Hours later, the Taliban spokesman offered this response: Hamid Karzai doesnt sound very chill. Hed really have to dial it back if he wanted to fit in at a workplace like this. "
0,"Looks like we narrowly avoided tragedy this morning. According to a White House press release, the Secret Service just discovered President Barack Obama trying to pull his own head off, but they managed to stop him before he succeeded. Wow. This could have been really bad. According to the White House, several Secret Service agents walked into the Lincoln Bedroom at approximately 6:45 a.m. and discovered President Obama standing alone in the middle of the room with his hands wrapped around his head and trying with considerable effort to remove it from his body. The agents who witnessed the scene said that the president seemed very calm, but that he was perspiring and breathing heavily, as if he had been trying to pull his head off for a number of hours. Agents attempted to yank President Obamas hands away from his head, but he calmly and silently swatted their hands away and continued trying to pull his head off. Eventually, the Secret Service had to wrestle the president to the ground and pin his arms to his sides in order to avoid a potential disaster. They later issued this statement via their official Twitter account: How does something like this happen? How can we trust the Secret Service to keep the president safe if they can barely stop him from tugging his own head off? It looks like the Secret Service needs to reevaluate their strategies for protecting the president so that a close call like this one doesnt happen again. "
0,"Well, this might be something to watch. Mayor Phillip Reid of Fairview, MN may have just gotten himself into some hot water. Earlier this morning, Reid stirred up controversy when he decided to remove the Nativity scene from the front lawn of City Hall because he thought someone had left it there for him as a gift. Uh-oh. I thought someone left it out there for me, so I took it home, said Reid in a press conference Monday. I know this looks bad, but honestly, Ive been having sort of a rough year, and I thought this was just a very nice gesture. The removal of Nativity scenes from public places is almost always controversial. One side becomes outraged by what they see as a War on Christmas, and regard the Nativity scenes removal as another sign that society has gotten too politically correct, while the other becomes incredibly passionate about what they believe to be the necessary separation between church and state. Its something that can divide a town in two, even if it only happened because the mayor thought he received an early Christmas gift. I dont know what else to say except that Im sorry, and also that the Nativity scene had amazing craftsmanship and authenticity, Reid added. My family will certainly be disappointed, but Ill be returning this back to City Hall immediately. Wow. Talk about controversy. This is definitely a story to keep your eye on in the coming weeks! "
0,"As preparations get under way for the first Republican Presidential debate, on Thursday night, a new poll shows that Americans are deeply concerned that the rest of the world might see it. According to the poll, there is widespread fear that, if the debate were to be viewed in foreign countries, the cost to the United States prestige around the world would be incalculable. On a more personal level, many expressed concern that any international broadcast of the debate would greatly diminish their desire to ever travel abroad or talk to foreigners. In another measure of Americans discomfort with Thursdays televised event, two of the TV programs they identified as being the biggest embarrassments to America, Duck Dynasty and Jersey Shore, still lagged far behind the debate. Those surveyed strongly agreed that the U.S. government should block the foreign transmission of the debate, or that Fox News should air an explanation of the contest beforehand, but they were at a loss as to what that explanation could possibly be. And, in a result that seemed to sum up Americans anxiety, a broad majority agreed with the statement God, this is so embarrassing. "
0,"Republican leaders warned the newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that they would frown on his shaking hands with President Obama at the United Nations today, saying that any embrace of Obama would signal that Iran was not serious about abandoning extremism. We welcome President Rouhanis moderate rhetoric, said Senator Rand Paul (R-Ken.). But those words are rendered hollow if he is willing to shake the hand of a notorious extremist. This is a man who has enslaved his people, saddling them with a health-care law not of their choosing, said Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). The President of Iran should think twice before shaking hands with a man like that. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor sounded a warning of his own: If the President of Iran wants to give the world the impression that he cares about human rights, he should be careful about cozying up to a despot who has continually tried to take away his peoples assault rifles. We encourage Mr. Rouhanis wish that Iran join the community of civilized nations, added House Speaker John Boehner, but first he must renounce Barack Obama. "
0,"Psychologists at the University of Minnesota have issued a research study recommending that people suffering from low self-esteem watch Thursday nights nationally televised Republican debate. The recommendation came after the psychologists spent weeks showing research subjects video clips of the debates potential participants and observed striking improvements in the subjects overall morale and sense of worth. We interviewed the volunteers before we exposed them to the Republican candidates and afterward, said psychologist Davis Logsdon. The spike in their self-esteem was off the charts. Of the candidates who most improved the research subjects sense of self, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were found to be consistently helpful, but the most marked increase in self-esteem levels came after the subjects were exposed to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. According to the data, people who viewed Walker for approximately three minutes reported feeling better right away about their intelligence, knowledge, and prospects for obtaining high-status employment that they had previously considered well beyond their reach. After watching Governor Walker, a substantial number of the subjects literally could not remember why they had ever felt bad about themselves, Logsdon said. In addition to recommending that low self-esteem-sufferers watch the debate, Logsdon is advising them to D.V.R. the entire two hours. You never know when you might need it again, he said. Watch: A tribute to the Fung Wah bus service. "
0," Moments after President Obama said he would allow insurers to continue health plans that were to be cancelled under the Affordable Care Act, leading Republicans blasted the President for agreeing with an idea that they had supported. Its true that weve been strongly in favor of Americans being allowed to keep their existing plans, said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). But now that the President is for it, were convinced that its a horrible idea. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) went further in ripping the President, calling Mr. Obamas tactic of adopting ideas proposed by him and fellow Republicans beneath contempt. The President should be aware that any future agreeing with us will be seen for what it is: a hostile act, he said. Minutes later, White House spokesman Jay Carney helmed a hastily called press conference, hoping to stem the quickly escalating coperation scandal. The President understands that he has offended some Republicans in Congress by agreeing with them, Mr. Carney said. He wants to apologize for that. But far from putting an end to the controversy, the Presidents apology drew a swift rebuke from another congressional Republican, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who called it a blatant provocation. If the President is going to continue agreeing with us and apologizing to us, he is playing with fire, he warned. "
0,"An aide to Rick Perry is confident that the Texas Governor proved he has what it takes to be President with his decision on Monday to send troops somewhere for no reason. By deploying a thousand National Guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border, Perry has shown that as President he would be ready and willing to use troops without a defined objective, mission, or exit strategy, the aide confirmed. Sending troops someplace with no clear idea of why they are going or what they are supposed to be doing once they get there is a key part of the Presidential skill set, said the aide, Harland Dorrinson. Rick Perry has just shown that hes got that nailed down. Dorrinson acknowledged that the gold standard for using troops for no reason might have been set by Perrys predecessor in Texas, George W. Bush, but added, If anyone can beat that record, its Rick. According to the aide, Perrys extremely Presidential response to the immigration crisis is already winning him the praise of G.O.P. voters. Nothing unites Republicans more than standing up to children, he said. "
0,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said today that she is seriously considering not running for President in 2016 after reading an avalanche of scathing one-star reviews on Amazon for her new book, Hard Choices. Secretary Clinton said that she was shattered to discover that dozens of people had apparently purchased her book on its first day of publication, read all six hundred and fifty-six pages in one sitting, and judged the finished product so unsatisfactory that it only merited one star on Amazon. These people all read my book cover to cover on the very first day it was published, so they must have really been looking forward to it, a shaken Clinton told reporters. Its devastating for me to think about how I must have let them down. As for her decision to forgo a possible 2016 White House run, Clinton said, The people who posted these one-star reviews on Amazon must have given their criticisms a great deal of thought and consideration. At the end of the day, if I did such a bad job writing a book, what kind of President could I possibly be? The former Secretary of State said that if the atrocious Amazon reviews keep piling up, she will most likely drop her Presidential bid, but she offered some idea of what she might do instead of running for the nations highest office. I think Ill roll up my sleeves and try to write a book that all of those one-star reviewers will really like, she said. I just hope theyll give me a second chance. Photograph by Joe Raedle/Getty. "
0,"Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) said that he was disappointed after meeting with President Obama at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, telling reporters, The President is stubbornly refusing to end the crisis I created. Government is about teamwork, Mr. Boehner continued. Ive done my part by putting together an entirely optional crisis that has shut down the government and will throw thousands out of work. Now its up to the President to do his part by ending it. Mr. Boehner said that he was flabbergasted that the President was looking to him to bring the current government shutdown to an end: So after doing all of the hard work to push the country to the brink, Im supposed to pull it back, too? How about you pitching in a little, Mr. President? The House Speaker said that he hoped he did not have to manufacture another entirely avoidable crisis over the debt ceiling in order to stir the President to action. Quite frankly, orchestrating these unnecessary stalemates takes a lot of energy and I could really use a rest, he said. But Mr. Boehner seemed pessimistic that the President got the message. Because of my actions, thousands of federal workers have already been furloughed, he said. How many more people do I have to throw out on the street before the President wakes up? "

Via Giphy.com We all want to believe that Beyonc and Jay Z really are Drunk In Love, but the fact that they went to the trouble of getting two separate graves instead of just one seems to suggest that the two music moguls are planning on spending some serious time apart.

0,"As the Supreme Court prepared to hear two cases involving same-sex marriage this week, Justice Antonin Scalia said that he would not allow his votes to be influenced in any way by his lifelong fear of gays. As Justices of the Supreme Court, we have a sacred duty to check our personal feelings at the door, he told the Fox News Channel. In my case, that means putting aside my longstanding and profound fear of homosexuals. Justice Scalia added that he was committed to safeguarding the rights of all Americanseven those I personally find terrifying. I take my role as an impartial arbiter very seriously, he said. So when I hear a case, I put all feelings of abhorrence, disgust, and revulsion completely out of my mind. The Justice said that when it came to the issue of same-sex marriage he would rely on the Constitution, which makes no mention of gays whatsoever. Remember, when the framers wrote the Constitution, there were no gays in America, he said. They didnt come here until the nineteen-sixties. All in all, he said, advocates of same-sex marriage should rest assured that he will listen to this weeks arguments with an open mind: Im going to apply the same robust sense of fairness that Ive brought to cases involving blacks and women.

0,"The tragic death of President John F. Kennedy still looms large over the consciousness of the American people. Now, you can own an instrumental piece from our 35th presidents last living day. The diving board that JFK died on after trying to do a back dive is officially up for sale. Sothebys auction house in New York announced today that the infamous pool platform is now being auctioned to the highest bidder, with a starting price of $500,000. Its a big price tag for a big piece of American history. Its a moment that is undoubtedly etched in the minds of those who were alive at the time. On a warm summer day in 1963, President Kennedy went for a dip in the pool at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Around 3:34 p.m., Kennedy walked to the edge of the diving board, announced that he was going to do a back dive, and jumped into the air. But as the president arched backward, he didnt get enough distance from the lip of the diving board and came crashing down on it headfirst, breaking his neck and dying instantly. In a second, the course of our nations historyand world history itselfwere irrevocably altered by a 6-foot-long aluminum reinforced recreational diving board. Who knows what the world would be like today if Kennedy had managed to clear the board, or even simply chosen to attempt an easier dive, like a front flip or a cannonball? Would we have stayed in Vietnam? Would we have faced another nuclear standoff with Russia? Its impossible to say. This is the first time the diving board that Kennedy fatally biffed it on has ever been put up for sale. Following the tragic accident, it was removed and briefly put on display at the Smithsonian. Eventually, it was returned to the hotel, where it sat in storage collecting dust for more than half a century. But now, the hotel has put it on the market with an asking price of half a million dollars, hoping to find a buyer capable of performing a much-needed restoration of the board and ensuring its historical preservation. Can you imagine owning the actual diving board that claimed the life of JFK on that fateful August day? That would be insane. "
0," Today, American International Group (A.I.G.) issued the following letter to American taxpayers. Dear American Taxpayers: In 2008, you paid for a bailout of A.I.G. totalling $182 billion. Today, we are writing to tell you that were thinking of suing you. When we made this decision, we knew we were in for some rough treatment from the media. Weve been called everything from soulless bloodsuckers to Satans scabrous handmaidens, and worse. At A.I.G., though, we have a different name for ourselves: true American heroes. You see, by suing the same people who bailed out our asses just five years ago, we are standing up for one of the most precious American rights of all: the right to sue someone who has just saved your life. Lets say that youre trapped in a burning building and a fireman pulls you out to safety. Once youre out of the fire, though, you notice that the fireman carelessly ripped the lapel of your Armani jacket. Shouldnt you be able to sue the fireman for the full cost of its replacement? Or lets say youre drowning in the ocean. A lifeguard dives in, pulls you back onto the shore, and administers mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Arent you entitled to take appropriate actioni.e., sue him for sexual harassment? By suing you, we are standing up for the right of every other American who might, through no fault of his own, have his life saved and want to sue the person who saved him for millions of dollars. And thats why were asking for your help today. Lawsuits arent cheap. They require highly paid lawyers, who rack up millions in legal fees, not to mention first-class airfare, hotels, and sumptuous gourmet mealshardly the kind of expense that we at A.I.G. can afford. Thats why wed like you to pay for it. You may think were expecting a lot, asking you for the money necessary for us to sue you. But, remember, theres a bigger principle at stake, and someday, if youre pulled from a burning building or an ocean, youll be glad you stood with us today. Oh, and as for our ad campaign, Thank you, America? Were sticking with that, just changing the first word. See you in court, Your friends at A.I.G. "
0,"In the first term in office, President Barack Obama has broken with a tradition established over the previous eight years through his controversial use of complete sentences, political observers say. New polls indicate that millions of Americans are put off by the Presidents unorthodox verbal tic, which has Mr. Obama employing grammatically correct sentences virtually every time he opens his mouth. Mr. Obamas decision to use complete sentences in his public pronouncements, as well as his insistence on the correct pronunciation of the word nuclear, has harmed his relection hopes among millions of voters who find his unusual speaking style unfamiliar and bizarre. According to Presidential historian Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, after eight years of George W. Bush many Americans find it alienating to have a President who speaks English as if it were his first language. Every time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement, says Mr. Logsdon. If he keeps it up, he is running the risk of sounding like an litist. The historian said that if Mr. Obama insists on using complete sentences in his speeches, on Election Day the public may find itself saying, O.K., subject, predicate, subject predicatewe get it, stop showing off. Elsewhere, consumers who believed that Nutella was nutritious have won a $3.05 million lawsuit, the highest award ever paid to morons. "

People are freaking out about the world coming to an endI totally get that, said the Google C.E.O. Larry Page in a conference call with reporters. But at Google we view the Apocalypse as a unique opportunity. This company was founded with the goal to organize the worlds information and we see the next three days as our chance to get that done. As for the marching orders that Page gave to Googles team of designers: The world is going to be destroyed and mankind will cease to exist. Make Google the last page they see, and give us one last chance to serve them tracking cookies. With the ancient Mayan prophets predicting that on Friday the earth will crash into a comet, collide with the planet Nibiru, or burn to a crisp in a mammoth solar storm, our designers have had a lot of cool stuff to work with, Mr. Page said. Mr. Page said that a buzz-worthy home page is crucial to what he sees as Googles final mission on Earth: We want to communicate to billions of people that this is the last day of human history, so maybe they should finally sign up for Google Plus. When reminded that the end of the world would mean the end of Google, too, Mr. Page was philosophical: As long as it also means the end of Apple and Microsoft, Im fine with that. "

0,"Oof. This may be a tough one for fans to hear, but the film world was dealt a harsh dose of truth yesterday when action star Jason Statham admitted that he did all his own stunts and has been doing so for the majority of his career. Though rumors have swirled for years, the 48-year-old English actor had never addressed them head-on until a press conference yesterday, where a visibly emotional Statham struggled to deliver his prepared statement. It was all me: I drove the car on top of the train in The Transporter; I fought the guy on the helicopter in Crank, said Statham, who was flanked by family members and representatives. For years Ive kept this hidden from audiences, but I hope I can repair the damage Ive done by admitting now that I did those stunts. Snatch; Death Race; The Expendables. It was me every time. Wow. However you feel now about the Furious 7 star, you have to admit it takes guts to lay it all out like that. Stathams fans have been weighing in ever since his announcement, and the responses run the gamut: Can Jasons star still shine as bright as it did before, or is it dulled for good? Let us know what you think on Facebook and Twitter. "
0,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un surprised Korea-watchers today by abruptly cancelling his nations controversial rocket test and launching a fragrance instead. The dictators signature fragrance, called Number Un, could be on store shelves in time for Christmas, according to the Korean Central News Agency. The decision to launch a fragrance rather than a rocket shows a kind of realism that has been rare in the Kim family, said North Korea expert Dr. Hiroshi Kyosuke, of the University of Tokyo. I think Kim Jong-un most likely said to himself, Given how badly my last rocket did, maybe Ill just launch a fragrance, he said. The official North Korean announcement offered this description of the new fragrance: Number Un deliriously combines the sweet smells of North Koreas native unicorns with the irresistible aroma of our Dear Leader himself. This holiday season, every kiss begins with Kim Jong-un. "

Beloved by many, Kofi tragically and unexpectedly passed away this weekend after choking on a child, and last night, the zoo held a candlelight vigil in his honor. According to a statement from zoo representatives, groundskeepers found Kofi unresponsive in his exhibit late Saturday afternoon. After they discovered that his breathing had become constricted, surgeons were immediately called to the scene, and they worked tirelessly to save Kofi for over 45 minutes. By the time they realized there was a 7-year-old boy lodged in Kofis throat, the giraffe had already passed on. Using the hashtag #GoodbyeKofi, the zoo announced over social media that it would be hosting a vigil for this amazing animal. The response was overwhelming: From generous donors to the local children who adored Kofi so, thousands of heartbroken San Diegans crowded into the zoo last night to mourn the loss of the giraffe who tragically died with a boy in his windpipe. Kofi was a valued and cherished part of our community, and his loss was avoidable, read the San Diego Zoos official statement. While our staff worked hard to remove an obstruction that made his way into his throat, he ultimately passed away Saturday evening. We will do our best to ensure nothing like this happens to another animal at our zoo again. Kofi may be gone, but he will always be remembered. Be sure to share your memories of this wonderful animal with the hashtag #GoodbyeKofi. "

Justice Scalia quit his post in a terse resignation letter that read, in part: Some of the happiest memories of my adult life have been as a scoutmaster. Huddling under blankets around the campfire, and so forth. But now, all of that has been ruined. Ruined. Shortly after sending the letter, Justice Scalia destroyed his scoutmaster uniform in the blazing fireplace of his Supreme Court office. Later, he went across the hall to share his decision with his close confidant on the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, telling him, Theres nowhere I feel safe anymore, Clarence. The military? The N.B.A.? Nowhere. I guess the only place I still feel safe is the Supreme Court. This is still a safe place, isnt it? Justice Thomas said nothing in reply. "
0,"When the curtain rises on the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign, all eyes will be on the bitter rivalry between the former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and the former Virginia senator Jim Webb. While both camps are mum about the vicious hatred that has consumed the two men on the campaign trail, political insiders familiar with the Chafee-Webb blood feud are expecting fireworks in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. Its always hard to make predictions about a debate, but one thing is guaranteed, the political scientist Davis Logsdon said. These two men cannot stand each other. Sources differ over what caused the white-hot hostility between the two former officeholders, but most agree that Webbs two-per-cent support in some polls deeply rankles Chafee, who has garnered only one per cent. Lincoln is a very, very competitive man, a source close to the former Rhode Island governor said. He thinks he should be the one with two per cent, not Webb, and hes determined to take Webb down. Logsdon, the political scientist, said that debate watchers can expect Webb to attempt a knockout punch on Chafee in the early minutes of the debate, but warned, That punch had better land. The last thing you want is to turn Lincoln Chafee into a wounded, bloodied animal, Logsdon said. He will lash out and kill you. For his part, Chafee hopes to attack Webb so brutally that the former senator is knocked out of the race once and for all. In a race without Webb, Chafee believes he scoops up Webbs two per cent, and then hes riding high, with three per cent, a source said. So Tuesday night could get very, very ugly. "
0," Today, former Senator Rick Santorum issued the following letter to the American people. Dear American People: When I think about government-mandated health care, I have the same response that any mature adult would have: it makes me want to throw up. Thats why, on my first day as President, I will repeal Obamacare. Well, actually, on my very first day Im going to repeal the Renaissance. And also the theory of evolution. But I will definitely get rid of Obamacare by Day Three, Four at the latest. You see, Obamacare runs counter to my well-documented position on personal freedom: I believe in the rights of the unborn child, until its born and wants a checkup. What will take the place of Obamacare? As your President, I will institute Santorumcare, a health-care plan that will cover absolutely no medical procedures whatsoever except one: exorcism. For many years, possession by the devil has been Americas No. 1 health problem, far more serious than those posed by cigarette manufacturers who have funneled millions to my PACs. You dont have to take Rick Santorums word for it that America is in the grips of a devil-possession epidemic: just watch any episode of Jersey Shore. Youre probably saying to yourself, Government-mandated exorcisms are a great idea, Rick. But how will we find the devil babies to exorcise? Good question, and I have a good answer: on my first day as President, I will order mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds for every woman in America. These ultrasounds will be a prerequisite to getting a drivers license at the D.M.V., where theres plenty of downtime for such a procedure. Additionally, they can be easily and safely performed by T.S.A. employees on the airport security line. If an ultrasound turns up any telltale signs of a devil baby (e.g., horns or tail) well schedule the woman for her government-mandated exorcism there and then. I hope after reviewing Santorumcare, youll agree that its the best health-care plan out there for you and your family. But just in case youre not sold yet, maybe this will seal the deal: leeches are a hundred per cent covered. Vote for me, Rick "

0,"Its an exciting day for science, because paleontologists in Argentina have dug up something absolutely remarkable! According to a report released today by Princeton University, a research team unearthed a 60-foot-long fossil of a newly discovered species of dinosaur that lived 78 million years ago and was composed of a single bone! Based on our study of the preserved specimen, we can determine that this creature had no skull, no ribs, and no legs, said researcher Steven Brentwood, whose team made the discovery. It was unable to walk, swim, or fly, but rather moved around by rolling from place to place. Coolest dinosaur ever? A paleoartist has reconstructed what this awesome beast would have looked like when alive: Incredible! According to Brentwood, the nearly immobile 20-ton dinosaur was an easy target for hungry predators such as Carnotaurus, the Argentinian T-Rex, but having one bone proved a successful defense mechanism. Swallowing any part of it was impossible, said Brentwood. It was essentially like trying to eat a big log. Unfortunately, this incredible defense mechanism came at the cost of side effects that led to the species early extinction. Even the slightest amount of rain was capable of drowning these creatures, said Brentwood. Beyond that, theyd often wind up getting trapped in valleys or at the bottoms of hills. Reproduction was difficult, because even if they survived mating, they rolled over their own eggs. We believe the specific creature we found died of starvation, because these dinosaurs were only able to catch prey that walked into their mouths, added Brentwood. Incredible! We cant wait to learn more about our new favorite prehistoric beast! "

It would not be productive for this nation, going forward, to crow about our victory over political adversaries, he said in a nationally televised address. So lets get it all out of our systems today. Immediately after the Presidents speech, loudspeakers outside the White House blasted We Are the Champions, and the national day of gloating began. In addition to a ticker-tape parade, the days events will include a screening on the Mall of a clip reel of Texas Senator Ted Cruzs marathon Senate speech, punctuated by sad trombone sounds. Starting tomorrow, my message to the Republicans is, Lets work together for the American people, said Obama, wearing what appeared to be a beer hat. But today my message is, We won, bitchaz. "
0,"Credit Photograph by Pete Souza / The White House WASHINGTON (Satire from The selfnews)Making good on one of his key campaign promises, President Obama signed an executive order on Tuesday relocating the United States Congress to Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. The President seemed to relish signing the order, calling the relocation a win-win for America, and indicating that Congress could be moved to its new headquarters immediately. We dont envision doing any renovations to the facility down there, he said. It is ready to house Congress right now. The President did not specify what the current U.S. Capitol building would be used for in the future, but he hinted that it could be the setting for historic renactments in the manner of Colonial Williamsburg. I think it could be fascinating to school groups, he said. It could really take them back to the olden days when it was a real, functioning place. Minutes after the President signed the order, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) called it an outrage and grounds for impeachment, but Obama appeared to take such howls of protest in stride. If Congress believes that this executive order is illegal, they can take it up with the Supreme Court, he said. Oh waitwe dont have a Supreme Court. Watch: We test which New York City establishments allow in a menagerie of emotional-support animals. "
0,"Well, this is a bummer. Less than two weeks after winning his first Academy Award for his performance in The Revenant, actor Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly dropped his Oscar statuette in the La Brea Tar Pits. According to witnesses, the A-lister arrived at the natural asphalt pools in a limousine Monday afternoon and loudly announced that he wanted to show everyone there his award. Impeccably dressed in a Giorgio Armani tuxedo, DiCaprio then spent the next two hours walking up to tourists and showing them the Oscar, explaining to each of them that the award is made of real gold, and weighs 100 pounds. Once there were no more tourists to interact with, DiCaprio declared that he wanted to look at the tar up close, sources close to the movie star confirmed. He then crouched down near one of the pools, bringing his face within inches of the viscous, bubbling liquid. It was at this moment that the Oscar statuette slipped from his grasp and plunged irretrievably into the tar. Distressed, DiCaprio reportedly called 911 several dozen times in the ensuing minutes, but emergency services were unable to assist him in recovering his award. Mr. DiCaprio did indeed drop his Oscar statuette into the La Brea Tar Pits earlier today, and he asks that the media respect his privacy during this difficult time, said a spokesman for the actor. Though he is devastated to have lost something he spent over 20 years trying to win in less than 20 days, he vows to try his best to win another Oscar to replace the one that fell into the tar.

According to the historian Davis Logsdon, who has been sifting through mounds of photographic evidence at the University of Minnesota, the nation apparently once held the view that investing in science and even math could yield accomplishments that would be a source of national pride. While Logsdon has not developed a complete theory to explain the United States pro-science stance during that era, he attributes some of it to the liberal views of the President at that time, Richard M. Nixon. "
0,"Accusing them of involvement in a widespread conspiracy to save President Obamas failed health-care program, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California) today subpoenaed the approximately seven million Americans who have signed up for Obamacare so far. Arguing that the impressive enrollment numbers dont pass the smell test, the House Oversight Committee chairman told reporters, Any rational person would come to the same conclusion that I have: namely, that this is a well-orchestrated conspiracy of seven million people trying to make Obamacare look good. The California Republican said that the seven million co-conspirators targeted by his subpoenas would be required to travel to Washington to testify before his committee or risk being found in contempt of Congress. If you signed up for Obamacare, you have a lot of explaining to do, he said. In announcing the subpoenas, Rep. Issa indicated that his committee could begin grilling the seven million Obamacare enrollees as early as next week. If my suspicions are correct, this could be bigger than Benghazi, he said. "
0,"House Speaker John Boehner announced that he would resign as Speaker and leave Congress in October, but said that he would continue repealing Obamacare from his home in Ohio. Explaining his decision, Boehner told reporters, A lot of the Speakers job is administrative, which is time-consuming and tiring. In retirement, Ill have more time for what I really love: repealing Obamacare. Boehner said that he plans to begin every day with a good breakfast, some exercise, and a vote to repeal Obamacare before lunch. No one knows how much time one is allotted on this planet, Boehner, striking a somber tone, said. But if the Lord above grants me good health, I will repeal Obamacare thousands of times before my journey ends. Watch: Bob Mankoff tries out product placement and looks at some advertising cartoons.

0,"Today Speaker of the House John Boehner issued the following letter to the American people: Dear American People, Yesterday, your hardworking House Republicans tried, once again, and failed, once again, to repeal Obamacare. And I really thought we had a good chance this time. Thats because we were all united in our hatred for this infernal and takes-too-long-to-read law. Every last one of us cast his vote to strike it down, from crazy little Paul Ryan to that arrogant bastard Eric Cantor. And I wish you could have seen the faces of those freshman Republicans as they voted to repeal Obamacareso innocent, so full of hope and wonder. As I told them yesterday, Youll never forget your first time. Its important for you to know that even as scandals swirl about the cesspool known as the White House, some folks in Washington are still working hard for the American people. It was a gruelling week for me, what with popping up in front of the TV cameras every five minutes saying, Whos going to jail?, plus trying to rid our land of Obamacare. But I dont want your thanks. Save that for the dedicated House Republicans who have now voted thirty-seven times to repeal. You cant put a price tag on that kind of performance. Well, actually, you can: its cost the taxpayers over fifty million dollars. And worth every million, damn it. One last thing. I know some of you are probably thinking that after suffering this latest defeat, we House Republicans are just going to take our bat and ball and go home. Well, theres an old saying where I come from: the thirty-eighth times the charm. Courage, John Boehner "
0,"Well, heres even more proof that self-starting young people are just amazing. When East Springfield High School lost funding for its ROTC program, dozens of young cadets were left without an extracurricular outlet. Thats when these resilient students stepped up big time and created their own on-campus paramilitary organization! They were told that they could no longer use the schools field for drilling. They were told the program was done for good. But these awesome and resourceful teens didnt listen. They pooled their money together to replace their ROTCs firearms arsenal. And it didnt stop there. Pretty soon, theyd renewed their efforts to acquire a fleet of ATVs, several months of survival rounds, and a bulk crate of live ammunition, and even designed an eye-catching new red armband that all the members are now sporting. Wow. Hows that for grit? These kids refused to let their ROTC program die. They made a plan, they acted on it, and now they effectively control a large part of the woods surrounding their small town and no longer attend classes! Nobodys really sure what theyre up to all hours of the day and night, but they sure look sharp marching up and down the towns main thoroughfare! If only every high school student could show half this groups drive and determination. And to think that this incredible paramilitary organization started from just a few budget cuts! These kids are awesome, and though it remains to be seen exactly what they want, it looks like we can expect big things from this group of armed young men and women. "
0,"The reanimated corpse of Dr. Jonas Salk, the medical researcher who developed the first polio vaccine, rose from the grave Friday morning on what authorities believe is a mission to hunt down idiots. The zombie version of Salk, wearing a tattered white lab coat and looking incredibly angry according to one eyewitness, was seen advancing on the U.S. Capitol building at approximately 11 A.M. While Senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, hid in the Senate cloakroom, armed security forces repelled the zombie virologist, who, seemingly unharmed, moved on in search of new prey. According to law enforcement, the reanimated Salk then stole a car and headed off in the direction of Trenton, New Jersey. We have reason to believe hes coming for Governor Christie, said a staff member from Chris Christies office. Fortunately, the Governor is never here. With both Disneyland and Marin County on high alert, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security warned that, as long as the rampaging vaccine pioneer was at large, law enforcement would be stretched thin. Unfortunately, we do not possess the resources to protect every idiot in this country, the spokesman said. "
0,"Arguing that its current system of laws is out of step with life in todays Florida, a growing chorus of lawmakers in the state are arguing for a measure that would eliminate laws altogether. Florida is rife with laws that say Do this, dont do that, said Gov. Rick Scott, a supporter of the measure. Speaking as a Floridian, I have found it exhausting pretending to obey them. There is broad support in the state for abolishing laws, according to a poll commissioned by the political action committee Citizens For a Lawless Florida. According to that poll, a majority of Floridians favor ridding the state of laws, while a sizable number did not know that the state had any. Weve been trying to remove laws piecemeal for the past few decades, but this measure seems like the most efficient way to take care of the whole problem, Gov. Scott said. For those who fear that eradicating Floridas laws would wreak havoc on life in the state, Gov. Scott offered this reassurance: Honestly, I dont think youll notice a difference. "
0,"In what has become a tradition in the nations capital, the United States Congress on Monday notched the third anniversary of doing nothing in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As on the first and second anniversaries of the tragedy, lawmakers took up no new measures to prevent future mass shootings in the United States, and instead chose to mark Newtowns third anniversary with a day of inaction. In that respect, the third anniversary of Newtown resembles the thousand-plus days that came before it, during which Congress took no action on guns except to periodically vote down expanded background checks. Interestingly, during this same period of time, many of these legislators were able to sleep at night, sources say. According to one congressional staffer, Harland Dorrinson, marking the anniversary of Newtown by doing nothing about guns is a tradition that is unlikely to change in the halls of Congress anytime soon. This should be a day of prayer and quiet reflection, he said. This should not be a day of doing something to make things better.

0,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is an evil genius capable of masterminding the most elaborate cover-up in U.S. history and is also a frail old woman with brain damage, leading Republicans charged on Sunday. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus led the attack while appearing on NBCs Meet the Press, where he said that the American people should be wary of electing a woman who is capable of orchestrating the complex conspiracy to whitewash Benghazi while, at the same time, being too old, feeble, and brain damaged to serve in the Oval Office. These two aspects of Secretary Clinton would have me very concerned, he said. Mr. Priebus said he saw no contradiction between the portrayals of Secretary Clinton as an evil mastermind and a brain-damaged crone, explaining, The one part of Secretary Clintons brain that works perfectly well is the part that creates elaborate cover-ups, and that is the part of her brain that is currently covering up the fact that she is brain damaged. The R.N.C. chairman said he was confident that once the American people realized Secretary Clinton is both an evil mastermind and a frail old woman with brain damage, they would reject her at the ballot box. The one thing the American people will not tolerate is double-talk, he said. "
0,"Word that the News Corporation chief executive Rupert Murdoch has filed for divorce from his wife, Wendi Deng, came as a total surprise to longtime Murdoch confidant Satan, the Lord of the Underworld said today. I am totally blindsided by this, Satan told reporters. He and I talk every day. Citing his long history with the media titan, the Hound of Hell said, We go way back. I gave him the idea for Fox News. I told him to hire Roger Ailes. Thats why this is such a shock. A frequent dining companion of the Murdochs, Satan said he didnt have a clue that they were having problems. Ive had dozens of dinners with them in the Hamptons, he said. Did they bicker? No more than other couples. But they seemed to be on the same page about all the important things, like creating corrupt media monopolies and buying politicians. I thought they were for keeps. Adding that he cares deeply about his friends, Satan said the news about the Murdochs had hit him especially hard: I was just starting to get over the Putins. The Prince of Darkness said he first got word of the Murdoch divorce about an hour before the official announcement: My banker at Goldman Sachs called and told me to sell my News Corp. stock right away.

0,"Responding to reports that President Obama is considering signing as many as nineteen executive orders on gun control, Republicans in Congress unleashed a blistering attack on him today, accusing Mr. Obama of cynically and systematically using his position as President to lead the country. Spearheading the offensive was Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who charged the President with the wanton exploitation of powers that are legally granted to him under the U.S. Constitution. Calling him the Law Professor-in-Chief, Rep. Stockman accused Mr. Obama of manipulating a little-known section of the Constitution, Article II, which outlines the power of the President. President Obama looks down the list of all of the powers that are legally his and hes like a kid in a candy store, Rep. Stockman said. Its nauseating. The Texas congressman said that if Mr. Obama persists in executing the office of the Presidency as defined by the Constitution, he could face impeachment and/or deportation. Noting that the President has not yet signed the executive orders on gun control, Rep. Stockman said that he hoped his stern words would serve as a wake-up call to Mr. Obama: Mr. President, theres still time for you to get in line. But if you continue to fulfill the duties of President of the United States that are expressly permitted in the Constitution, you are playing with fire. "

0,"To all the film buffs out there, heres some news that will really make your day. Tim Burton treated lucky fans at a film festival Q&A yesterday to a bit of behind-the-scenes trivia when he revealed that he got the idea for his 1990 film, Edward Scissorhands, from scissors. You might be interested to know that the movie Edward Scissorhands owes a large creative debt to scissors, Burton told the audience of festivalgoers. The movie is largely based on the idea of scissors and having scissors for hands, and the concept of having scissors for hands came from scissors and me thinking about scissors. The legendary director was even generous enough to talk through the evolution of the movie idea that would eventually become the Edward Scissorhands we know and love. I was sitting in my office looking at a pair of scissors, and I eventually realized that I could write a movie about a man who was looking at a pair of scissors, Burton said. Then I realized that I might not even need the scissors. Why not get rid of the scissors entirely and just make a movie about a man? I decided to cut the scissors out of the film. But the concept of cutting reminded me of something else that cuts: scissors. This gave me an idea: What if the man in my movie had scissors attached to his wrists instead of hands? The rest is history. Burton went on to explain that the role that scissors play in Edward Scissorhands cannot be overstated. Scissors are incredibly important to the whole film, the director said. I reference scissors in nearly every scene of Edward Scissorshands, and scissors play a central role in several crucial plot points of the movie, such as the scene where Vincent Prices character gets stabbed with scissors and the scene where Johnny Depps character has scissors for hands. Its also worth noting that the main character of the film is actually named Edward Scissorhands, which is a name that is partly based on scissors. Basically, without scissors, the movie Edward Scissorhands as we know it today would not exist, Burton added. It would be a very different movie. Incredible! Its amazing to see the creative process of a master director at work. Heres hoping we get another fascinating glimpse into Tim Burtons twisted mind sometime soon! "
0,"All right, science fans, get ready for literally the coolest news youll hear all day! NASA officials announced today that theyre developing a rover that will land on Pluto and spray milk all over its surface by the year 2040! According to scientists at a press conference this morning, the mission of the rover, which NASA has named Orpheus, is to land on Pluto to assess the geological and atmospheric composition of the enigmatic dwarf planet, collect data on nearby celestial bodies, and violently dispense large quantities of milk in all directions. To complete its mission, the rover will be equipped with a mounted camera, thousands of gallons of milk, dozens of milk-dispensing hoses, and a robotic arm for collecting and analyzing surface samples. As soon as the rover lands on Pluto, it will use its camera to establish a visual link with mission control so that NASA can closely monitor Plutos landscape. Orpheus will then deploy dozens of hoses, which will begin spinning rapidly as the rover fires a steady stream of milk across the surface of the distant dwarf planet. The rovers milk hoses will spin rapidly in order to ensure that milk gets sprayed all over the place! This morning, NASA officials issued the following statement on their website about the Orpheus rovers long-term goals: Announcing The Orpheus Rover: As part of NASAs mission to explore the furthest reaches of our universe and to understand humankinds place in the vastness of the cosmos, the Orpheus rover will journey to Pluto to squirt milk all over the place. The rover will get the surface of Pluto all wet with milk, and were pleased to announce that the milk will freeze in fun shapes and patterns due to Plutos sub-zero temperatures. Furthermore, if were not alone in the universe, we hope that extraterrestrial civilizations find the milk and think the milk is good. It is our greatest hope that any alien beings who find the oceans of milk we deposit on Pluto see the milk and say, Here is milk at last. Many people are worried that the extraterrestrial life forms might try to drink the milk, and in order to ensure that this does not happen, we have written the message Please Do Not Drink This Delicious White Milk on the front of the rover. The milk will be a mixture of cows milk and goats milk. Thank you. Incredible! Of course, the day Orpheus will finally flood Pluto with milk is still years away, and the operation is incredibly complicated. Until then, NASA says it will spend time perfecting the technology, conducting further research, harvesting thousands of gallons of milk from dairy farms across America, and waiting for perfect astronomical conditions to allow the rover to make a safe flight. It will be a long journey, but we cant wait for 2040, when the Orpheus rover finally reaches Pluto and drenches it in milk! Well be sure to keep you updated as new information becomes available. Science FTW! "

While the official ratings for democracys finale will not be available until Thursday, initial reports indicated that a larger than expected number tuned in to witness the last moments of the nations system of government. Network executives had warned that the final episode was not for the squeamish, but many viewers were still shocked by how dark and apocalyptic it turned out to be. One reviewer, calling the finale a shattering conclusion, wrote, For casual fans of American democracy who werent paying much attention to it lately, what they saw in Wednesdays episode must have come as a shock: a cast of characters who were thoroughly unlikable, unappealing, and, in the end, totally unredeemed. Still, based on the strong ratings for Wednesdays episode, network executives decided to supersize democracys death throes by scheduling a dozen additional episodes between now and November, 2016. In the words of one executive, American democracy is not as popular as it once was, but a lot of people still want to see how it ends. Watch: Dickens doubled them, Dickinson juggled them.

0,"The National Security Agency is compensating for the expiration of its power to collect the American peoples personal information by logging on to Facebook, the agency confirmed on Monday. The director of the N.S.A., Admiral Michael S. Rogers, said that when parts of the Patriot Act expired at midnight on Sunday, intelligence analysts immediately stopped collecting mountains of phone metadata and started reading billions of Facebook updates instead. From a surveillance point of view, the transition has been seamless, Rogers said. While the N.S.A. has monitored Facebook in the past, it is now spending twenty-four hours a day sifting through billions of baby pictures, pet videos, and photographs of recently enjoyed food to detect possible threats to the United States. Those status updates contain everything we want to know, Rogers said. In many cases, a good deal more than we want to know. Citing one possible downside of the new surveillance regime, Rogers said that some N.S.A. analysts who now do nothing but monitor Facebook all day report feelings of worthlessness and despair. I remind them that theyre doing this for America, he said. The N.S.A.s new strategy drew a sharp rebuke from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), who told reporters, I just blocked them. "

The United States Senate is showing contempt for the American people by refusing to get off their ass, a defiant Mr. Boehner told reporters. And the only fitting way for me to protest their reckless behavior is by remaining on my ass for as long as humanly possible. Take a good look, ladies and gentlemen of the press, he said, before leaving the lectern in a huff. This is the last youll see of old John Boehner off his ass. Mr. Boehners words drew a strong rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who said that Mr. Boehners suggestion that the Senate get off their ass while he remained on his seems like the height of hypocrisy, ass-wise. True to his word, Mr. Boehner then held an additional press conference, this time sitting in a chair from which he showed no signs of budging. Photograph by Win McNamee/Getty. "

Its true, weve resisted any deal on nukes for over three decades, the Ayatollah said. But when we saw how much trouble Obama was having with his Web site, we realized it would be uncaring of us not to try to help him out. The Ayatollah said he was not overly optimistic that signing a nuclear treaty with the West would be sufficient to distract attention from the Presidents Obamacare woes, but, he added, You never know. Every little bit helps. He said that he and Irans leaders will be putting their heads together in the days and weeks ahead to see if theres anything else we can do to help Obama out of this health-care mess. One idea were tossing around is to get the Iranian people to stop chanting, Death to America, the way they have for the past thirty-four years, he said.

For the past six years, we have enjoyed a President who has been conciliatory and acquiescent to the point of emasculation, Boehner said. We want that President back. McConnell threatened that if Obama does not return to his weak and ineffectual ways at once, he will face the prospect of being a two-term President. At the White House, the President did not respond to the Republicans remarks, telling reporters that he planned to work through the weekend raising the minimum wage, granting amnesty to immigrants, and legalizing marijuana.

Almost immediately after Fox released the list there was an outcry over its choices, as the seven narcissists who were omitted complained that they were easily as egotistical and self-absorbed as those who made the cut. The president of Fox News, Roger Ailes, called the criticism understandable, coming from narcissists, but acknowledged that choosing the top ten narcissists in America was ultimately a matter of opinion.

According to several eyewitnesses, Yorke was sitting in an Oxfordshire, England coffee shop and hitting himself in the head the way someone does when theyre trying to get the wheels in their brain turning, reportedly saying things like Come on, Thom! and Think, Thom, think! in between smacks. Not only that, but patrons say he also filled a garbage can with crumpled-up pieces of paper in the manner of someone hard at work, continuing to throw them in the general area of the can long after it became full. At one point, he even started humming the Final Jeopardy theme as he sat with his head in his hands, and when he finished, he smacked his head a single time and said, All right, Thom. Lets do this! For fans who have been itching for new Radiohead since they released their last album in 2011, it looks like the wait is going to be over soon! Yorke himself has yet to comment, but Radiohead lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood had this to say when a fan brought it up on Twitter: This is huge. Rumors about the bands upcoming ninth studio album have run rampant in recent months, but little is known about the actual content of the record. This recent development, however, pretty much guarantees that its going to be amazing. Lets hope there are even more sightings of Thom smacking his head in the coming weeks! So, yeah.

Sean, the lucky groom, was over the moon to host his surprise celebrity guest! We were posing for photos, and all of a sudden I saw a man waving at me, Sean said. I turned to my wife and said, Isnt that Bill Murray? and she said, Oh, my God! It is! The couple was more than happy to let the Caddyshack star pose with them to commemorate his unexpected presence on their special day. It seemed like the celebration couldnt get any better.

While the anti-fear tenor of Mr. Obamas comment was offensive enough to some, the President made matters worse by suggesting that science would play the leading role in guiding the nations Ebola protocolsa role that many Americans believe should be played by fear. Across the country, Democratic candidates have sought to distance themselves from the Presidents incendiary statement, especially in states like North Carolina, where science and facts have record-low approval ratings. Carol Foyler, a Democratic consultant in Colorado, said that she was smacking my head at the Presidents divisive comment. Hes unpopular enough as it is, she said. Aligning yourself with science and facts is a surefire way to alienate millions of Americans. "

In major cities across the nation, fast-food workers and other service employees held signs, shouted chants, and gave impassioned speeches to demonstrate their conviction that Congress deserves a maximum hourly wage of fifteen dollars. Members of Congress are people, just like you and me, Tracy Klugian, a McDonalds employee who took part in the Washington protest, said. They should be paid what they deserve. Assuming that they continue to take off approximately two hundred and forty days a year, members of Congress earning the proposed maximum would see their average annual income adjusted from a hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars to thirteen thousand five hundred dollars, a salary that many marchers called fair and equitable. I know what members of Congress will say: I cant live on that, Harland Dorrinson, a protester in Chicago, said. Well, if they want to earn more, they should go out and acquire some skills. While organizers of the marches proclaimed todays protests a success, in some cities the demonstrations met some opposition from counter-protesters, who argued that fifteen dollars was too much. "

At the end of the day, it would be the height of hypocrisy to ban unpatriotic books from our schools but allow unpatriotic students to attend them, Harland Dorrinson, a spokesman for the school board, said. This was a very easy call for us. By transforming its schools into student-free zones, he explained, Arvada expects to realize significant cost savings, mainly through the elimination of teachers. Dorrinson said that he was cautiously optimistic that the boards latest action would serve as a model for other school districts across the country. There isnt a school in America whose problems couldnt be solved by removing its students, he said. "
0,"In what may be the most serious allegation ever made against the former Secretary of State, Fox News Channel reported today that Hillary Clinton was involved in the conspiracy to murder President Abraham Lincoln. The latest charge against Mrs. Clinton was reported by Fox host Sean Hannity, who said that the evidence of her role in the Lincoln assassination came mainly in the form of e-mails. According to Mr. Hannity, If its true that Hillary Clinton killed Lincoln, this could have a major impact on her chances in 2016. The accusation against Mrs. Clinton drew a strong response from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.S. Carolina): Theres been a concerted effort by Hillary Clinton to cover up her role in President Lincolns murder. She has said nothing about it. This is bigger than Watergate, the Cuban missile crisis, and the Second World War put together. Responding to the allegation, Mrs. Clinton issued a terse statement indicating that she could not have participated in Lincolns assassination because she was born in 1947. Thats what she wants us to believe, Sen. Graham said. "

I tried talking to him one time, and he just looked at me and smoke started pouring out of his mask. He wouldnt go home at night, either.

0,"As House Republicans began their five-week summer vacation, their leader, House Speaker John Boehner, urged them to rest up for the many symbolic and meaningless votes that lie ahead. Mr. Boehner, while congratulating his colleagues on having voted to repeal Obamacare forty times, reminded his fellow-Republicans that their work is far from over. I want you to come back from vacation rested and refreshed, because weve got another year of futile, time-wasting votes to cast, he said. Only the strong will survive. According to Mr. Boehner, this years gruelling schedule of fake-repeal votes had been the G.O.P.s most physically punishing ever. Noting that the exhausting ordeal of frequent, pointless Obamacare votes had transformed his fellow House Republicans into hollowed-out husks of their former selves, the Speaker observed, Purely symbolic voting may be even more exhausting than actual work. Its true that voting to repeal Obamacare has cost the American taxpayer over fifty million dollars, he said. But thats nothing compared to the toll its taken on us. For his part, Mr. Boehner said he intends to spend August at the beach, as he always does, fruitlessly trying to change the rules of volleyball. "
0,"Ronald Reagan may be gone, but his legacy will live on forever. The United States government just unveiled a new statue on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. depicting the 40th president lying facedown in a hammock! Beautiful! Thousands of people were present at the statues emotional unveiling ceremony yesterday. Numerous prominent Americans, including Senator John McCain and First Lady Michelle Obama, stood beneath Reagans outstretched body and delivered heartfelt addresses to commemorate the historic occasion. The ceremony concluded with a squad of Marines placing a wreath at the base of the statue, just below an engraving that reads May this monument of President Ronald Reagan lying prone in a hammock endure for all time, and may his contributions to our glorious American democracy endure along with it. According to an official statement released by Congress, the statues design is incredibly intricate, and nearly every detail has a symbolic meaning. As Reagan lies facedown, his eyes are wide open as he stares at the ground through the mesh of the hammock, symbolizing his vigilance and wisdom. His face is blank and expressionless, displaying no discernible emotion, which represents the poise and calm with which he led the nation. Truly moving. At 50 feet tall and 80 feet long, the statue is one of the largest monuments on the National Mall, and is a truly fitting tribute to our nations 40th president. This is an incredible way to commemorate the life of such an influential figure. We cant wait to get a chance to visit the statue of Ronald Reagan lying facedown in a hammock as soon as possible! "

Calling the accident one of the biggest embarrassments in F.B.I. history, bureau spokesman Harland Dorrinson told reporters, Theres no way to express how bad we feel about what happened to that phone. Walking reporters through the mishap, Dorrinson said that shortly after the iPhone was unlocked, There were a lot of high-fives, which led to the unfortunate spilling of the water. After repeatedly attempting to reboot the phone with no success, the F.B.I. consulted several Apple support forums for tips on fixing a waterlogged iPhone. I wish I could report that any of them worked, the spokesman said. In a possible thawing of relations between Apple and the F.B.I., Apple C.E.O.

Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said today that he believes he has a secret weapon that will derail Hillary Clintons 2016 White House bid: A little-known affair between her husband and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Appearing on the Fox News Channel, Paul told the host Sean Hannity, Sean, when the American people find out about this scandal, they are going to be shocked, truly shocked. It didnt get a lot of coverage at the time. Asked by Hannity how the scandal could have remained under wraps for so long, Paul replied, Youll have to ask Bill and Hillary that. Lets just say theyve pulled a lot of strings to keep this story out of the mainstream media. Unfortunately for them, Sean, I have the details on this juicy scandal and Im prepared to share them with the American people, he said. I think its going to be a game-changer. While he believes that the shocking revelations about President Clintons Oval Office dalliances will be enough to destroy Hillarys 2016 ambitions, Paul confirmed that he has other arrows in his quiver. It turns out that Hillary was involved in a business deal called Whitewater, he said. When the American people find out about this, its going to blow their minds. "
0," The fact-checking department at NBC News has verified that the following anecdotes told by Brian Williams actually happened. 1. In August of 2003, I boarded a helicopter to Steven Spielbergs house in East Hampton. Once we were up in the air, I was alarmed to discover that there was no bottled water on board. I commanded the pilot to make an emergency landing. 2. In November of 2007, I boarded a Cadillac Escalade to attend the annual gala of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Not until I arrived at my destination did I realize that the driver had closed the door on my Armani coat. I was able to have it successfully dry-cleaned, but that was a close one. 3. In March of 1998, I fell asleep on my tanning bed. I could have been burnt to a crisp. Fortunately, I woke up in the nick of time, but the people at the spa had needlessly endangered me. I started going to a new spa. 4. In May of 2011, the elevator in my building suffered an equipment malfunction en route to my penthouse. I was stuck talking to a tax attorney for seven minutes before I was rescued. 5. While in Sochi for the Olympics last year, I ordered dinner from room service. I dont know if it was the oysters or the caviar, but something had gone bad. I was hurling all night. 6. In December of last year, I had to attend a live broadcast of Peter Pan. It was worse than I expected, but I was trapped for two hours with no way out. "
0,"Weve seen a lot of clueless companies misuse Twitter, but its going to be hard to top the blunder Ace Hardware just made. Yesterday, @AceHardware sent out numerous tweets proving that the company has no idea what hammers are. This would be pretty embarrassing for any organization, but for a hardware store, its even worse. Read the tweets for yourself and youll see how big a mistake it was: Youd hope it wouldve stopped there, but the company kept going. Its hard not to cringe as you watch Ace put its foot in its mouth over and over again. After thousands of people flooded Aces Twitter feed and other social media channels with responses that the item was a hammer, the company was quick to delete its tweets. But by that point, the damage was already done. This morning, the organization seems to be in crisis mode, and has already issued an apology: Yikes. This debacle proves that social media is a double-edged sword. If used correctly, Twitter can build your brand, but just one carelessly worded tweet about hammers can leave you with a whole lot of egg on your face. "
0,"In a world where troubling teen social media trends are a dime a dozen, its hard to take them all seriously. But one of the latest crazes to sweep teenage social media should have all parents deeply concerned. If you havent been paying attention to #JumpZooFenceSelfie, you better start now, because it is one of the most dangerousand popularhashtags to ever hit the internet. In order to fully grasp its implications, one must first crack the code of what the hashtag really means. When a teenager posts the hashtag to Twitter or Instagram, it signifies that they have climbed over a fence at a zoo and entered the habitat of a captive animalthis is what is meant by JumpZooFence. If this werent already concerning enough on its own, the Selfie portion of the hashtag requires the teenager to take a photograph of themselves posing with an animal. Add all the pieces up, and it becomes clear that #JumpZooFenceSelfie involves trespassing into a zoo exhibit and taking a picture with a wild animal. And while the hashtag might have just started as innocent teenage fun, the stakes have recently grown higher and more perilous, which has many experts worried. It was mostly innocuous in the beginning, with kids taking pictures with gentle animals like tortoises and cranes, but the forces of peer pressure have really upped the ante, said Dr. Brenda Swanson, a social researcher at Stanford University. Now, to win the respect of your peers, youre expected to pose with something dangerous, like a cobra or an alligator. The really scary part, however, is the number of teens getting involved. A recent poll showed that over 11 percent of teens have already participated in the hashtag and nearly 50 percent would consider trying it in the future. The same poll also found that 78 percent of teens either agreed or strongly agreed that, if a cheetah were charging at them at 65 mph from a distance of 20 feet, they could take a selfie and climb out of the zoo exhibit quickly enough to escape harm. While the hashtag might seem alluring at first, many teens are realizing in increasingly tragic ways that it simply isnt worth it. Sixteen-year-old Cleveland resident Shelby DeMeteran honors student and star athletewas hospitalized earlier this summer after being brutally attacked by chimpanzees. Now, shes urging any kids who are thinking about participating in #JumpZooFenceSelfie to strongly reconsider. I used to think #JumpZooFenceSelfie was cool, but its just the latest in a series of dangerous teen trends, said Shelby, citing #EatSomeForks and #RobAFootLocker as additional examples. I hope other kids my age will hear my story and realize that, actually, sometimes climbing into a cage with huge wild animals isnt all that fun. Heres hoping her peers will listenbefore its too late!

0,"Declaring that my time has come, the former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum announced today that he was officially launching his 2020 campaign for President. Washington is broken, and Ive got some fresh new ideas about how to fix it, Santorum told a small clutch of supporters and whatever family members were available, at an intimate rally in Des Moines. Once the people of this great nation hear those ideas, theres no stopping me. Im in it to win it! he exclaimed, to some clapping. Launching his campaign in Iowa, where the next Presidential caucuses will not be held for another forty-eight months, Santorum brushed aside suggestions that he was entering the race too early. Youll have to take that up with Jesus Christ, he said. Hes the guy who told me to do this. Reaction to the announcement was muted, with some saying that Santorum should continue running for President if it makes him happy.

0," President Obamas call during his State of the Union address to stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans received a frosty response from the pro-tragedy wing in Congress last night. After Mr. Obama made his controversial stopping-tragedies remark, prominent pro-tragedy members of Congress looked on in stony silence, refusing to applaud. I thought it was offensive and inappropriate, said Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana). If the President wants coperation from Congress, he should refrain from his divisive and inflammatory anti-tragedy rhetoric. The pro-tragedy lobby is among the most powerful in Washington, spending millions annually to defeat politicians who oppose tragedies. Another congressman with a strong pro-tragedy voting record, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina), also blasted the Presidents remark, accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a war on tragedy. If the President really thinks he is going to prevent more tragedies, he should be prepared for a fight, Rep. Wilson said. The American peoples right to tragedies is protected by the United States Constitution. "
0,"Millions of Americans lost consciousness on Wednesday night between the hours of 9 and 10:30 P.M. E.T., according to widespread anecdotal reports from coast to coast. The sudden epidemic of sleepiness prevented voters from watching more than a minute or two of the first Presidential debate between former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, which the few observers who remained awake have called the most tedious in American history. Moderator Jim Lehrers opening instruction to the audience that they remain silent proved unnecessary, since within minutes most of them sat with their heads tipped forward, drool visibly dangling from their mouths. Mr. Obama began the debate with a high-risk tactic that seemed designed to alienate huge swaths of the countrythe use of math and factsbut ultimately his words seemed unlikely to turn off many viewers, who were soon off on their journey to dreamland. Mr. Romneys much-trumpeted zingers were nowhere in evidence, except for a mystifying non-sequitur attack on PBSs Big Bird. The only fireworks came at the very beginning of the debate, when Mr. Obama congratulated his wife, Michelle, on their twentieth wedding anniversary, drawing this response from Mr. Romney: I disagree with your decision to marry Michelle. On Day One, Ill reverse it. "
0,"If youre keeping score at home about whether or not a War on Christmas is going on in this country, it looks like you can add another tally to the Yes side: Historically black churches in the South keep getting burned down. Yep, this ones pretty much an open-and-shut case. Sure, its easy to write off the War on Christmas as hyperbolic, but from Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in North Carolina to Gods Power Church of Christ in Georgia, 2015 has seen multiple fires intentionally set to predominately black churches. Its pretty difficult to say that there isnt something going on when stuff like this keeps happening. Just look at the facts: Cashiers now say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. Nativity scenes are being removed from city halls. Churches where members of the African-American community go to celebrate their faith are getting deliberately burned down. And of course, who can forget the recent Starbucks red cup fiasco? This isnt the first time these types of churches have been burned down, either. With a little digging, youll discover that its clear that they have been targeted and purposely set ablaze for decades, going back well before the 1960s! The phrase War on Christmas is a fairly recent addition to our lexicon, but when you look at the long history of terror that has been waged against black churches, it definitely seems like a war has been going on for much longereven before people started saying Winter Break. Whatever that is. Oh, and just last month, the FBI arrested two men who were planning to bomb a primarily black church. Of course, we understand that not everyone celebrates Christmas, but isnt this going just a little too far? With the holiday season coming up, youll hear a lot of people dismiss the War on Christmas as a right-wing talking point. But the next time you hear someone say Happy Holidays or read about a predominantly black church burning down, maybe youll think twice. "
0," As the mystery surrounding the absence of dictator Kim Jong-un deepens, the North Korean government on Wednesday issued an official statement reassuring its citizens that it had a deep bench of brutal madmen. While it offered no comment about the status of Kim, the statement from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) emphasized that making North Korea an authoritarian horror-drome is not the achievement of one man; it has been and will always be a team effort. There are at least twelve highly unbalanced people at the upper echelon of this government who, at a moments notice, can imprison an ex-lover, execute a relative, or threaten to incinerate the United States in a sea of fire, the statement read. No other government has a roster that strong. As North Koreans, youve come to expect a level of mercurial brutality unrivalled by any other country on the planet, the statement continued. As your leaders, we promise that will never change. In a further effort to reassure the North Korean people, the statement concluded with a declaration of war against Mars. "

Well, one awesome new app is trying to scoop up these dissatisfied users with a totally unique approach. Say hello to LuvConnect, a dating app for people who just want to click on pictures of tractors and never go on any dates! If youre single, want it to stay that way, and have a deep desire to click on thousands of pictures of tractors, then this just might be the dating app youve been waiting for. Heres how it works: Download the app on your phone and create a profile. Once youve filled in some basic information about yourself (favorite movies, music, a brief bio, etc.), youre ready to jump in and start clicking on pictures of tractors. LuvConnect lets you click on tractor pictures once or even twice, if you really like the picture or just feel like clicking twice for no reason. Another fun feature is that you can browse other users profiles, but you cant message or match with them in any way. Swipe left or swipe rightboth actions just give you more pictures of tractors that you can click on until your thumbs get tired or your phone runs out of battery. Um, yeah, we want this yesterday. The dating app boasts a library of over 3 million clickable tractor pictures, including pictures of utility tractors, orchard tractors, garden tractors, and more.

0,"After a report from the Yale Center on Climate Change Communication showed that the term climate change elicits relatively little concern from the American public, leading scientists are recommending replacing it with a new term: You will be burnt to a crisp and die. Other terms under consideration by the scientists include your cities will be ravaged by tsunamis and floods and earth will be a fiery hellhole incapable of supporting human life. Scientists were generally supportive of the suggestions, with many favoring the term your future will involve rowing a boat down a river of rotting corpses. Any of these terms would do a better job conveying the urgency of the problem, Tracy Klugian, a spokesperson for the newly renamed Yale Center for Oh My God Wake Up You Assholes, said. "
0,"Just hours after being sworn in at the U.S. Capitol, the freshman class of House Republicans said that they were disappointed that they failed to shut down the government on their first day in office. We were all like, O.K., were sworn in, lets shut this thing down, said freshman Rep. Byron Ernie (R-Kentucky). We were all pretty bummed that the government just kept running. Rep. Ernie acknowledged that it might have been overly optimistic of the freshman Republicans to expect to engineer a government shutdown on their very first day, but bringing the government to a random standstill was the whole reason we became Republicans, he said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) chuckled good-naturedly at the ambitions of the high-spirited G.O.P. freshmen, telling reporters, I remember what it was like to be young and full of big ideas about crippling our historic institutions for no discernible reason whatsoever. Theres nothing like your first time. Surveying the cherubic faces of the incoming Republicans, he said, Theyre like kids who want to close down a candy store. Looking beyond the disappointment of his first day, Rep. Ernie said he was looking forward to that magical day when he and his fellow Republican freshmen get to participate in their very first government shutdown: Well be paralyzing the government in the same building where John Boehner and Eric Cantor did it, and Newt Gingrich before them. Its like playing basketball in the same arena as Michael Jordan. "
0,"The spending cuts mandated by the sequester may hamper the United Statess ability to invade countries for absolutely no reason, a Pentagon spokesman warned today. The Pentagon made this gloomy assessment amid widespread fears that the nations ability to wage totally optional wars based on bogus pretexts may be in peril. Historically, the United States has stood ready and able to throw billions of dollars at a military campaign with no clear rationale or well-defined objective, said spokesman Harland Dorrinson. Our capacity to wage war willy-nilly is now in jeopardy. In the past, Mr. Dorrinson said, the Pentagon has had the resources to fight three meaningless and completely random wars at any given time, but now in our planning meetings we are cutting that number back to two. Sen. Lindsey Graham (RS.C.) agreed about the catastrophic effects of the Pentagon cuts, telling reporters, The ability of the United States to project its military power in an arbitrary and totally capricious way must never be compromised. The cuts are already being felt in a tangible way at the Pentagon, which today cancelled an order for a nine-thousand-dollar pen. "

Critics of the move dismissed it as political theatre, noting that once the Cowboys arrived at the border it was unclear what they would do there.

0,"Yesterday was an emotional day in China, as the Peoples Liberation Army held a national military funeral for movie star Sean Penn. It was a time for solemn mourning and reflection, and Chinese people all across the country took the day off work to attend the many elaborate ceremonies and pay their final respects to the Hollywood legend. Somber military processionals were held throughout all major Chinese cities featuring hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers marching in lockstep. According to reports, Chinese citizens across the country lined the streets and threw flowers at the feet of the marching soldiers, with many weeping or clutching framed photographs of Sean Penn to their chests. Since the Chinese military was not able to recover Penns body, a life-size mannequin was produced and placed inside an ornate ivory casket. Chinese president Xi Jinping himself then stepped forward, visibly sobbing, and placed a Chinese flag over Sean Penns coffin. From Carlitos Way to Milk, Sean Penns art and work have touched our souls and enriched our lives, President Xi said in a statement that was broadcast nationally on every major Chinese news station. We shall never forget Sean Penn, and his legacy will live on forever in the hearts and minds of the Peoples Republic of China. The military band then played the Chinese national anthem as a small group of soldiers gently placed the casket into a five-story mausoleum within the Sean Penn shrine. Today, the Chinese people have returned to work, but a rotating battalion of armed guards will stand 24-hour watch over Sean Penns mausoleum forever. Its a poignant way to honor an artist who produced such powerful work. "

Harland Dorrinson, 47, a tire salesman from Lexington, Kentucky, packed up his family and whatever belongings he could fit into his Chevy Suburban just hours before the health-insurance exchanges opened, joining the Tea Partys Freedom Caravan with one goal in mind: escape from Obamacare. My father didnt have health care and neither did my fathers father before him, he said. Ill be damned if Im going to let my children have it. But after driving over ten hours to the Canadian border, Mr. Dorrinson was dismayed to learn that Americas northern neighbor had been in the iron grip of health care for decades. The border guard was so calm when he told me, as if it was the most normal thing in the world, he said. Its like he was brainwashed by health care. Turning away from Canada, Mr. Dorrinson joined a procession of Tea Party cars heading south to Mexico, noting, They may have drug cartels and narcoterrorism down there, but at least theyve kept health care out. Mr. Dorrinson was halfway to the southern border before he heard through the Tea Party grapevine that Mexico, too, has public health care, as do Great Britain, Japan, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Slovenia, and dozens of other countries to which he had considered fleeing. Undaunted, Mr. Dorrinson said he had begun looking into additional countries, like Chad and North Korea, but he expressed astonishment at a world seemingly overrun by health care. It turns out that the United States is one of the last countries on earth to get it, he said. It makes me proud to be an American. "
0,"Finally, a better way to produce food than farming! Using innovative genetic engineering technology, scientists from Virginia Tech have succeeded in merging all your favorite plants and animals together into a single creature, so pretty soon everything in your fridge will be produced inside one of the amazing new animals theyre calling a foodnode. We believe foodnodes can someday be used to replace current farming practices, which waste miles and miles of land on crops and livestock, said Dr. David Hausler, a researcher from Virginia Techs College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Whether its beef, chicken meat, milk, grain, or the eggs that come from the foodnodes udders, you can make everything a human would want to consume. Most recently, researchers produced a foodnode with pork membrane removable from the rear, added Hausler. This will revolutionize American farming as we know it. Wow. Pretty cool, huh? Vegetarians shouldnt worry about being left out either! To get fruits and vegetables, just reach inside one of the foodnodes orifices and feel around for tumors. Each one is a different type of produce. Yank the lump free, peel off the skin, and youve got everything from apples to broccoli! So, how long before foodnodes start replacing Americas farms for good? Well, scientists say current foodnodes have lifespans of approximately two minutes, but its only a matter of time before these gentle beasts change how America produces and consumes food! "
0,"In what Secretary of State John Kerry described as a significant foreign-policy coup, the U.S. claimed, on Tuesday, that it had successfully located a moderate Syrian rebel. Though Kerry did not elaborate on how the U.S. did so, he said that locating the rebel was the culmination of a months-long effort. The Secretary of State said that the Syrian had been appropriately vetted and was deemed moderately rebellious. He definitely seems to be the sort of gentleman we can work with, Kerry said, adding that several millions of dollars would be spent arming and training the rebel in the days and weeks ahead. Kerry said that the governments successful identification of a moderate Syrian rebel was a major victory that should silence critics of the U.S.s strategy in Iraq and Syria. To all of the naysayers who have been arguing that there are no moderate Syrian rebels, I am here today to say that we have found one, Kerry said. And if we have found one, that means that there must be others out there. "
0,"Its always nice when a celebrity shows that theyre capable of doing something for others, and Jon Hamm did just that and then some this past weekend. When a whale washed up on a Malibu beach Sunday afternoon, the Mad Men star showed up and made crepes for the struggling creature. Wow! According to eyewitness reports, no one knew what to do after the once-majestic ocean dweller emerged on the beach, but before those present could come to a consensus, Hamm appeared and began heating up a crepe pan on the spot. Sure, the crashing waves made it difficult for the pan to retain heat, but the Golden Globe winner selflessly used his body to deflect as much of the cold water as he could. And even as his eyes grew red and irritated from the saltwater, he kept a clear focus on the task at hand! Hamms compassion and determination were matched only by his preparedness, as he laid out a selection of crepe ingredients both sweet and savory, from freshly grown peppers and mushrooms to the juiciest strawberries you could imagine. Sources say that despite a lack of formal culinary training, Hamm produced a nearly perfect strawberry and Nutella crepe. But knowing that a whales stomach is significantly larger than that of a human, Hamm realized that one wasnt enough, and he spent the next five hours churning out delicious crepes for this animal in need. When the sun finally began to set, Hamm meticulously and safely packed up his cooking station and disposed of his garbage in the proper receptacles. And as a team of scientists who had gathered to help push the whale back into the ocean began their task, they thanked Hamm for what he had done. But Hamm, eternally humble, refused to take any credit. Though that doesnt change the fact that he is, without a doubt, the kindest man alive! "

After working for over three years with a 270-pound gorilla named Sampson, researchers say he is now able to fully express over 1,500 signs of modified sign language and has even come out as a homosexual to his father! Wow. Science FTW! While many gorillas are able to learn simple words such as ball and lettuce, Sampson is a special case. His language skills have progressed to the point that he can actually sign full sentences and express all the thoughts needed to tell his father the truth about his sexuality. According to the researchers, Sampson was in an enclosure with his father, Max, when they witnessed his miraculous breakthrough. He approached his father, and as the other gorillas in the facility looked on, he signed out his first complete sentence: Me gorilla love man gorilla. Simply incredible! While his father is incapable of comprehending sign language, the researchers are very excited to continue their work with him so that one day he might understand Sampsons message. But for now, science has helped an intelligent young gorilla tell his father who he really is. Nice! "

In that worst-case scenario, it would be inhumane to ask them to pay more than thirteen per cent. Vice-Presidential pick Paul Ryan echoed Mr. Romneys sentiments, adding that he was glad he voted to cut emergency relief earlier this year because big government needs to stay out of hurricanes. If the federal government got involved with this hurricane, theyd make the usual mistake of sending food, water, and medical supplies, he said. Clearly, what this situation calls for is vouchers. "

0," The Church of England, an institution whose origins date back to the sixth century A.D., has far more modern views about the rights of women than Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, experts said today. In recognizing that women are the equals of men, the Church of England has embraced a position that is centuries ahead of Scalias, Davis Logsdon, a professor of religion at the University of Minnesota, said. This is a remarkable achievement, given that Scalia was born in 1936 and the Church began in the late five hundreds. But Dr. Carol Foyler, a history professor at the University of Sussex, took issue with that assessment. I date the beginning of the Church of England to 1534, when it was officially established under Henry VIII, she said. But regardless of whether the Church is fourteen centuries old or five centuries old, its unquestionably more modern than Scalia. As for Justice Scalia, he seemed to dismiss the controversy, issuing a terse official statement Monday afternoon. I do not keep up with the goings on of every newfangled institution, he said. "
0,"At a hastily called press conference today, Chris Christie revealed that he only became aware that he was the governor of New Jersey in the past seventy-two hours. Unbeknownst to me, some people I thought I could trust were secretly working to elect me governor of this state, a visibly stunned Christie told reporters. I have acted swiftly and fired them all. While asserting that he had terminated all of the people who were involved in the scheme to elect him, he said that, if he finds additional conspirators, I will deal with them accordingly. Christie struggled to explain how he remained in the dark about being governor, a position he has held since 2010: I guess Im just not much of a detail person. People think Im a micromanager. Im not. If a bunch of people are going behind my back and plotting to make me the governor, thats not the kind of thing I pick up on. Reflecting on his reaction to the news that he is the governor of New Jersey, Christie said he felt angry, embarrassed, and humiliated, but mainly just sad. Its sad that this was allowed to happen, he said. Its a sad situation for me and for New Jersey. Photograph by Spencer Platt/Getty. "

0,"When it comes to female empowerment, Barbie dolls typically arent among the first images that come to mind. For years, the toy brand has rightfully been under fire for pushing dated and unrealistic portrayals of women onto young girls. However, the latest product from the makers of Barbie appears to be a big step in the right direction: Mattel just announced the release of a Female Interim CEO Barbie! Nice! Its about time. Dressed in designer black pants, heels, and a classic, tailored blazer, Female Interim CEO Barbie is the embodiment of class and confidence, ready to take on the most powerful role at the company while they search for new leadership. And unlike some past iterations, this Barbie is about more than just good looks. Shes the smart, savvy businesswoman that shareholders deserve to have at the helm until the board names the permanent CEO. When the concept first came up, the mandate was that this new Barbie needed to show girls that anything is possible, said Mattel spokesperson Laura Masterson. With Female Interim CEO Barbie, were connecting girls to a role model with the vision and drive to excel in a high-profile role for a transition period of six or seven months. Finally, a Barbie doll that parents dont have to feel guilty about buying for their kids! Now, girls can use playtime to learn that they can go from senior VP to CEO and back again. Only time will tell if this move can win over the brands many critics, but regardless, its refreshing to see a company like Mattel invest in giving young girls the examples of teamwork and temporary leadership they need. Truly inspiring! "
0,"For over a century, the Statue of Liberty was the first thing immigrants saw when they arrived in the land of opportunity. It symbolized hope and the dream of a better lifebut it has always been incomplete. Today, however, its incomplete no longer: After more than 130 years, France has finally sent America the Statue of Libertys husband. So. Much. Yes. Lady Liberty is alone no more! While France had originally planned to build both statues back in 1875, budget issues left only enough money for one. But last year, the French government dug up the plans and finally constructed the accompanying statue. Now, Liberty Husband is finally reunited with his wife, Lady Liberty, in America, and we couldnt be more pumped! They look perfect together! The beautiful neoclassical husband is made entirely of copper and steel, and has many intricate details. His flowing robes and well-kept beard hark back to the days of ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy. The spear in his right hand symbolizes his readiness to protect freedom, and his beautiful wife, from any threat. The new statue is 10 feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty! For too long, the Manhattan harbor has looked a little lonely with only Lady Liberty keeping watch. Now, New Yorkers and tourists alike can bask in the beautiful image of the wedded guardians standing tall and vigilant, tender and loving. So thank you, France, for finally making good on your promise! We love our new statue, and we are thrilled that Lady Liberty finally has her man back in her life. "
0,"Becoming a star in the world of hip-hop is all about earning respect, and part of earning respect is going head-to-head with those who disrespect you. Here are a few of the most epic hip-hop feuds of all time. 1. 50 Cent and Ja Rule The feud between these two hip-hop moguls originated in the early 2000s, when Ja Rule borrowed 50 Cents DVD of The Shawshank Redemption and never gave it back. Ja Rule claims that he doesnt remember borrowing the DVD, but 50 Cent is adamant that he lent it to him, going so far as to implore Ja Rule to at least look around for it on his 2002 single Wanksta. 2. Diddy and Suge Knight The East Coast vs. West Coast beef goes way back with these two. Born on the same day on opposite sides of the country, the infants Diddy and Suge Knight came into the world and immediately sprinted out of the hospital, charging across multiple states until finally meeting up in a field in Nebraska, where they began strangling each other. Decades later, they still havent stopped. 3. Nicki Minaj and Lil Kim In an attempt to prove herself as an up-and-coming artist, Nicki Minaj rapped on her debut album about Lil Kim being swallowed by a pelican. The diss so enraged Lil Kim that she fired back with a brutal track about Nicki Minaj being swallowed by a pelican as well. Never one to back down, Minaj immediately released an entire album in which Lil Kim is swallowed by a pelican once in every song. Many have speculated about how Kim will respond to this latest transgression, but chances are shes not going to turn the other cheek. 4. T.I. and Ludacris These two ATL rappers have been fiercely competitive with each other for most of their respective careers, but luckily, this hip-hop beef has a happy ending. The two buried the hatchet in 2007, collaborating on a track in which T.I. rhymed Ludacris with phenomenal kiss and Ludacris rhymed T.I. with great guy, a symbol of their newfound respect for one another. 5. Eminem and Several Unruly Swans Nobody knows what a few unruly swans did in 1999 to incur the wrath of Eminem, but the Detroit rapper has railed against them for more than a decade in both his music and his personal life. Its not all swans I have a problem with, just several of them that I happen to know are very unruly, said Eminem on the red carpet at the 2003 Grammys. Those unruly ones are always causing problems and are, on the whole, way too rowdy. I refuse to even be in the same room as them. 6. 2Pac and Biggie After being friends for years, 2Pac and Biggie had a falling out over differing opinions about the 1992 general election in the United Kingdom. 2Pac was a Labour supporter, while Biggie championed John Major and the Conservatives. The rest is history. "
0,"In an indication of shifting global attitudes toward the United States, the nation has become the laughingstock of the world for something other than its gun laws, a new survey of foreigners indicates. According to the survey, which was conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, Americas gun laws, which used to inspire the most derision toward the country from people around the world, now place a distant second. In another startling result, the U.S. Congresss position on climate change, which in the past had been a leading candidate for making the U.S. the worlds favorite punch line, also finished far out of the money. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the poll for the University of Minnesota, said he was struck by the unanimity of foreign respondents when they were asked to name what, in their opinion, currently made the United States the laughingstock of the world. In all the years weve done this survey, we have never had ninety-four per cent of respondents give an identical answer, he said. When asked to explain why they chose the answer they did, a wide majority of those surveyed were unable to stop laughing long enough to give a coherent response, Logsdon said.

0," In a deepening humanitarian crisis, residents of the city of Austin report that they are completely surrounded by Texas, a situation that locals are calling dire. Austin has traditionally enjoyed freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, hosting film festivals and literary events without the interference of its hostile neighbors, but there are growing fears that those days may be coming to an end. Alarmingly, citizens of Austin report, extremists within the city limits have taken over the Capitol Building and installed a militant government with dominion over its residents. In recent days, Austin has made desperate requests for assistance to the U.S. military, which will be conducting exercises in Texas in July. The city is hoping that the United States will use its military might to liberate the isolated municipality and transform it into an independent state along the lines of Kurdistan. But those who live in this besieged city are growing increasingly desperate as they await military aid. In the words of one resident, We feel so alone here. "

The British monarchs brutal evisceration of Gov. Christie stunned observers, who did not know that she was such a close follower of his gay-marriage stance. I dont like to badmouth people, she said. But Im the head of a monarchy that began in the ninth century, and Im apparently more modern than Chris Christie. After shocking observers with her opening salvo, she continued to tear Gov. Christie to shreds. Look, I know he has to appeal to the crazy right wingers in his party, she added. But the fact is, hes not as forward-thinking as an eighty-seven-year-old lady who wears a crown on her head. Its pathetic. Asked if she had advice for Gov. Christie, the British monarch said, bluntly, Just sign the damn bill, Chris. Responding to a reporters question about the upcoming royal birth, Elizabeth replied, Tell you the truth? Im just glad the kids not being born in New Jersey. "
0,"Two days after their team completed a losing season for the fifteenth time in seventeen years, a consortium of Cleveland Browns fans has formally applied to relocate the N.F.L. franchise to Los Angeles. Unlike other teams vying to move to L.A., such as the St. Louis Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Oakland Raiders, the Browns application is believed to be the only one submitted entirely by fans. The Browns owner, Jimmy Haslam, said that he was unaware when he purchased the team that the citys fans could unilaterally relocate it. Obviously, being an N.F.L. owner has been something of a steep learning curve for me, he said. According to Butch Rydzewski, the Browns fan who is masterminding the relocation effort, Los Angeles is the ideal destination for the team because it is two thousand miles away and someplace most of us have no intention of ever visiting. In addition to relocating the team, Rydzewski said that Browns fans were putting measures in place to make sure that the team never returns. We are lobbying the city council to demolish FirstEnergy Stadium, he said. Only then can the healing begin. But, even as Cleveland fans pushed forward on the relocation plan, city officials in Los Angeles were taking steps to prevent the Browns from moving there, including taking out a restraining order against quarterback Johnny Manziel.

The audience, which had gathered to hear Mr. Snowden answer questions about the N.S.A. and government surveillance, was instead treated to the first-ever live performance of songs from Mr. Snowdens album, simply titled Edward. I made this music for you, my fans, Mr. Snowden said, adding that he doesnt care about the haters. Listeners were divided about the quality of the eclectic four-song set, which spanned musical styles from alt-country to dubstep. Music critic Tracy Klugian said, Snowden is the most exciting new artist to come out of SXSW in a long time. It reminded me of the first time I heard Conor Oberst. She acknowledged that not every song worked. Obviously, the duet with Kesha was a mistake, she said. But I give him credit for trying. Music journalist Harland Dorrinson was less impressed. Snowden said it was new music, but I didnt hear anything new, he said. In addition to N.S.A. documents, it sounds like hes been downloading a lot of Arcade Fire. After performing the four songs, Mr. Snowden disappointed some in the audience by refusing to talk about government surveillance. Dont get me wrong, Im proud of the whistle-blowing I did, he said. But today I just want to talk about my music. "
0,"As the partial government shutdown grinds on into its twelfth day, Americans remain deeply divided over what kind of wild animal they would most like to see Congress mauled by, according to a new poll released today. While a majority of Americans say they would enjoy seeing Congress torn limb from limb by a ferocious bear, there is disagreement over which species of bear would be best suited for that assignment. When asked, What kind of bear would do the best job of savaging Congress with its fearsome paws?, Americans gave grizzly bears the highest job-approval rating, followed by polar bears, and by black bears in a distant third. But the poll showed that there was also strong support for the idea of Congress being set upon by a pack of rapacious animals, with rabid hyenas the first choice of many respondents, followed by feral dogs and cats. While insatiable, bloodthirsty mammals were most often cited as the animals Americans would like to see eviscerate Congress, there was significant support for another scenario, involving Congress being consumed by a swarm of predatory insects. Fifteen per cent of those surveyed strongly agreed with the statement, Being torn limb from limb by a grizzly bear or devoured by a pack of rabid hyenas is too good for these people. They should be eaten, very slowly, by a colony of hungry fire ants. Yes, thats itfire ants. That would be amazing. "

Since 1976, Habitat for Humanity has been leading the charge to improve living conditions worldwide, building and renovating thousands of homes each year. Now, the charity is helping on a larger scale than ever, thanks to a bold new initiative to air-drop houses into some of the countrys most needy areas. Incredible! After a pilot program last March filled the skies of western Kentucky with an array of fully furnished, energy-efficient homes, organizers knew they had something special. Over the course of eight days, Habitats fleet of specially equipped C-130 cargo planes successfully dispersed over 740 tons worth of houses from an altitude of 12,000 feet, proving the programs potential to change the world of affordable housing like never before. Since the program rolled out nationwide in mid-January, theres been no shortage of volunteers. Thousands of people from Detroit to New Mexico have worked tirelessly to build the houses needed for the program, like the 1,000-square-foot single-family ranch home that landed in Cincinnatis Eden Park, or the split-level Craftsman that came to rest just east of a water treatment plant in Ames, IA. For many, the hard work was all worth it to see the fruits of their labor. Its amazing to see the bay doors open and watch someones new home go hurtling off the loading ramp, said Alex Conroy, one of many volunteers who gave up their weekend to help rig up the houses and deliver them to their designated drop zones. Hopefully, Ill be able to return in a couple weeks, when we drop off the garages and swing sets. Wow. What a great way to step up and make a difference! Thanks to the heroes at Habitat for Humanity, these houses are transforming neighborhoods and changing lives. Way to go! "

When asked the question, Who cares more about people like me? thirty-seven per cent of voters responded, Mitt Romney, while fifty-two per cent said, Chair.

After disappointing results in Tuesdays election, Mr. Priebus said that it was time for Republicans to become more tolerant of those with a math-and-science lifestyle. Just because we dont believe in those things doesnt mean we cant get along with people who do, he said. We want to send this message: math and science Americans are Americans, too. In the biggest departure from its previous electoral strategy, Mr. Priebus said, the Republican Party is even considering trying to appeal to women. I read recently that women are as much as fifty-one per cent of the population, he said. That number sounded crazy high to me, but maybe one of our new math Republicans can check on it for us. "
0,"Saying it was high time to take action against the number one cause of violence in America, the National Rifle Association issued a statement today urging a sweeping ban on movies. Tracy Klugian, an official spokesperson for the gun-lobbying organization, said that the N.R.A. had taken this extraordinary step because it could not stand idly by and watch movies tear apart the fabric of our civil society. To that end, Mr. Klugian said, the N.R.A. would use money from its PAC, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund, to support politicians who favored a ban on filmed entertainment. In the hours after the N.R.A.s announcement, politicians on both sides of the aisle were quick to applaud the group for identifying what it called a long overdue need for movie control. It is time for us to stop the madness, said Speaker of the House John Boehner. As a first step, I am proposing legislation that would impose a two-year waiting period and background check before one is allowed to see a Hollywood release. Minutes later, the White House said that the Speakers proposal was a good first step, but does not go far enough, arguing that Congress had to take a hard look at whether superhero costumes and masks should continue to be legal. All in all, the N.R.A.s Klugian said he was cautiously optimistic that the organizations call for new legislation would be heeded because our message finally seems to be getting through: Guns dont kill people. Movies kill people. "
0,"President Obama is courting controversy with his decision to address a group that has become dominated in recent years by extremists. Some have questioned the appropriateness of the President speaking to such an extremist group, especially because in the past it has issued threats against the United States government. As recently as 2013, for example, the extremists threatened to shut down the entire federal government if their demands were not met. On Tuesday afternoon, the White House defended the Presidents decision to speak to the extremists, pointing out that the Administration had also initiated dialogues with Iran and North Korea. "

The United States Constitution guarantees the American people that its government will be free from activity, Boehner told reporters. Again and again, President Obama has broken that sacred trust. Ripping the President for his willful insistence on doing things, Speaker Boehner said that his lawsuit was intended to restore the inaction and inertia that have been the hallmarks of our democracy. The Speaker acknowledged that suing the President was an extreme measure, but added, I take this step only after exhausting every other method to prevent him from getting anything done. Concluding his remarks, Boehner said that he hoped his lawsuit would send a powerful message to President Obama: If you stubbornly continue to take actions that result in tangible outcomes, you will be very, very sorry.

He not only shattered baseballs color barrier, but he did so as one of the most talented people to ever lace up a pair of cleats. Thats why Major League Baseball is paying homage to the great No. 42 by having his widow throw out the first pitch at all 2,430 baseball games this season. Wow, what an amazing tribute! Since Jackies passing, 93-year-old Rachel Robinson has played a huge part in keeping her husbands legacy alive. But this year, the MLB is helping her spread Jackies message of equality by having Rachel toss the ceremonial first pitch at all 81 home games for all 30 teams. Its a touching way to remind fans of Jackies lasting contributions to this great game. Starting yesterday and going through the final game of the regular season in October, a typical day for Rachel will involve throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium before catching the subway over to Citi Field. Once shes done there, itll be off to LaGuardia to hop in a private jet waiting to charter her from ballpark to ballpark. But her day wont be done until she finally takes the mound at Dodger Stadium over 12 hours later for her last pitch of the day, as 50,000 adoring fans cheer her on. After a quick nights sleep, shell be right back at it the next day. If Jackie were alive today, theres no doubt hed be smiling. Forget winning the 1949 NL MVP Award; this is truly the greatest honor that MLB has ever bestowed upon Jackie Robinson, and he couldnt be more deserving of it. If youre headed to a Major League ballpark at any point this season, get ready to be part of something amazing! "

Pauls reign as the states most embarrassing thing began in 2010, when he took the title from fellow Senator Mitch McConnell. Prior to Pauls reign, McConnell had been the undisputed most embarrassing thing about Kentucky for a staggering twenty-five years.

0," A rising chorus of congressional Republicans are calling on President Obama to acknowledge that the pop singer Beyonc lip-synched during his inaugural festivities on Monday and resign from office, effective immediately. By lip-synching the national anthem, Beyonc has cast a dark cloud over the Presidents second term, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). The only way President Obama can remove that cloud is by resigning from office at once. While many in the media have blamed Beyonc for the lip-synching controversy, Mr. Paul said, We must remember that this happened on President Obamas watch. Mr. Paul said that the White Houses refusal to comment on the Beyonc crisis only serves the argument that this President has something to hide. If Beyonc lip-synched the national anthem, how do we know President Obama didnt lip-sync his oath of office? he said. If thats the case, hes not legally President. But just to be on the safe side, he should resign anyway. Mr. Paul also blasted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her testimony on Benghazi before the Senate today: Her tactic of answering each and every question we asked her didnt fool anyone. "
0,"Credit Photograph by Aude Guerrucci/picture-alliance/dpa/AP WASHINGTON (Satire from The selfnews)Adding a new wrinkle in an already unpredictable election year, Donald Trump saw his poll numbers plummet on Monday after receiving a surprise endorsement from President Barack Obama. The long-awaited downfall of the abrasive billionaire came in startling fashion, as few had expected the President to offer a full-throated endorsement of Trump, especially on the eve of the all-important Super Tuesday primaries. Praising the Republican front-runner during a nationally televised address, the President said that, despite media reports to the contrary, Trump shared his views on such important issues as immigration and religious tolerance. In every way that matters, Donald and I are on exactly the same page, Obama said, pointing to a framed picture of the billionaire on his Oval Office desk. Concluding his endorsement with an emphatic closing argument, Obama said, If you love me, vote for Trump. In several G.O.P. polls taken after the Presidents stunning endorsement, Trump sank from first to fifth place, trailing the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson by several points. As news of the Presidents endorsement spread, former Trump supporters across the nation gathered to vent their anger, with some burning signs, trucker hats, and other campaign paraphernalia at impromptu bonfires. Harland Dorrinson, who had attended a massive Trump rally in Alabama just a day earlier, said that he now felt totally betrayed by the billionaire.

When Paul passed away last week, his family set out to honor his dying wish, and now, thanks to their efforts, the Dark Knight star is making that wish come true by allowing Paul to be buried inside of him. Incredible! I was just glad to help, said Bale, who took a four-week break from shooting his latest film to grant his fans final request. As actors, we have a chance to make a difference in peoples lives. I see this as a way to honor Pauls life and give comfort to his family. Id do it again in a heartbeat. Truly inspiring. A lot of celebrities say they care about their fans, but Bale definitely showed that hes willing to go the extra mile! In a private ceremony on Sunday attended by close friends and family, doctors opened up the 41-year-old actor and laid Paul to rest inside his chest cavity. Relatives paid their respects one last time as Pauls body parts were carefully arranged in the unused space around Bales internal organs, and Pauls brother read one of Pauls favorite poems while Bales chest was stitched back up. Pauls sister, Bethany, was clearly moved by the actors kindness. Its been difficult to come to terms with Pauls death, but I think going through this process has brought us all closer to him, she said after the ceremony. Christian could have just sent a card, but hes been so generous with his time and energy. Now, any time we see Christian Bale, well also be looking at Paul. Wow. Kudos to Christian Bale for proving that even in Hollywood, its still possible to be a person first and an actor second. Faith in humanity restored! "

Now, after 12 years of marriage, hes expressing that love in a really special way: When his wife started drowning in a swimming pool, he immediately went out and shaved his head in solidarity with her. Wow. What a beautiful symbol of James devotion to his splashing, flailing wife. Husband of the year! As soon as Claudia started going under, I wanted to find a way to let her know that I was there for her, said James, his once curly brown hair now reduced to stubble. I thought, if shaving my head can make her feel less weird about drowning, then thats what I need to do. To show her that shes not alone in this and that were going to get through it together. As husband and wife. Beautiful. If youre wondering what love looks like, its this. A man shaving his head as a show of support for the now-entirely-submerged love of his life. Claudias got a long battle ahead, but shes lucky to have such a steadfast partner in James. Through it all, hell be right there by the side of the pool cheering her on and encouraging her. Inspiring!

0,"A group of scholars who have been monitoring the descent of the bar over the past few decades have concluded that the bar can no longer be lowered, the scholars announced on Friday. The academics, led by Professor Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, published their conclusion after their research definitively found that the bar had finally dropped to its lowest possible position. For those who thought the bar still had room to be lowered, our findings resoundingly contradict that assumption, Logsdon said. The bar is now essentially flush with the ground. Logsdon acknowledged that he and his fellow scholars have come under fire in the past for claiming that the bar could not be further lowered, specifically when they issued a paper to that effect after the selection of the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 2008. We got that one wrong, he said. Clearly, the bar still had a way to go. Now that the issue of whether the bar can be further lowered has been settled, Logsdon and his colleagues plan to examine the question of whether there is anything left to scrape at the bottom of the barrel. Our findings are preliminary, but it appears that the answer is no, he said. "

The doctor who performed the surgery called the procedure extremely invasivejust the way the Vice-President wanted it. A hospital spokesman said that Mr. Cheney was expected to make a full recovery, but that he was somewhat disoriented coming out of anesthesia: When we asked him who the President of the United States was, he said, Is it still me?

Leaving behind their mansions and yachts, the millionaires were motivated by what they saw as an existential threat to the country, Mitch McConnell, a spokesman for the millionaires, said. This was an extremely diverse coalition, McConnell said, noting that everyone from the rich to the very rich to the super-rich united to vote down the bill.

0,"Well, this is insane. After a long week, 28-year-old Boston resident Jennifer Bauer just wanted a relaxing night where everything went well. But thats totally impossible, right? Well, guess what? It actually happened. Via Giphy.com It started right after Jennifer got off work and her best friend, Maggie, texted her asking if she wanted to hang out at a nearby bar with a couple of their good friends. A nearby bar? A few good friends? Incredibly, those are Jennifers ideal parameters for a good night! This story already seems too crazy to be true, but trust us: It really happened. And the eerie coincidences dont stop there. When Jennifer walked into the bar, she saw that Amanda, Megan, Megans boyfriend, Sam, and Maggie were already inside. Amazingly, she didnt have to go through the anxiety of getting a table or anything, because they already had one. Well wait while you pick up the pieces of your mind off the floor. Youre probably assuming that work was discussed, right? Nope. Strangely enough, it didnt even come up once, and incredibly, Jennifer didnt even think about the day she just had. She just had a couple of reasonably priced cocktails, coincidentally getting what she considers to be the perfect level of drunk. Yeah, this is almost scary. If you think things couldnt get any freakier, just wait for this: At one point in the night, Jennifers favorite Kanye West song came on the jukebox! Via Giphy.com What. The. Fuck. How do you explain something like this? This woman needed one night where everything went well, and weirdly enough, tonight was that night. Consider us freaked out. "
0,"After claiming on Sunday that human activity does not cause climate change, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) suddenly found his ignorance credentials under attack by potential rivals for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination. Now that Marcos thinking of running for President, he doesnt believe in climate change, said Texas Governor Rick Perry. To those of us with long track records of ignorance on this issue, he seems a little late to the rodeo. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) echoed Gov. Perrys criticism, calling Rubio a dummy-come-lately on climate change. At the end of the day, I have faith that Republican voters can tell the difference between someone whos truly uninformed and someone whos just faking it, he said. These comments by Marco dont pass the smell test. By Sunday evening, a defensive Sen. Rubio was pushing back against the attacks, telling reporters, Any questions about the authenticity of my ignorance are deeply offensive to me. My refusal to accept the scientific research on climate change is a matter of public record, he said. On this issue and many others my ignorance should take a back seat to no ones. "
0,"Before today, Taylor Mannello was just an average 10-year-old on vacation with his family. His concerns were minor, his responsibilities limited. But when Taylor and his family checked into the Best Western in Santa Barbara, CA this morning, something happened that would change his life forever: Taylor was entrusted with his own hotel room key. Wow. A fifth-grader with his own room key. Is that even legal? Turns out it is. And the implications are staggering. Taylor is now free to journey outside his familys hotel room whenever he wants to, entirely on his own. As long as he tells his parents where hes going and doesnt stay out too long, the 10-year-old can pretty much go wherever he wants in the hotel. That includes the elevator, the business center, the weight room, and even the pool. That means that, technically, he could just feel like going down to the jacuzzi and then actually just go down to the jacuzzi. And hes not even in middle school yet. Incredible. But if you think Taylors taking his new responsibility lightly, youre dead wrong. Since the moment his father handed him the room key, a smooth plastic rectangle that kind of looks like a credit card, he has kept it in the zipper pocket of his cargo shorts. The elementary-schooler is keenly aware of the fact that if he loses this one, hes not getting a new one. Theres a reason that his younger sister, Katy, was not given a room key. She wouldnt be able to handle it. So far, the power of the room key doesnt appear to have gone to Taylors head. At least, he hasnt yet betrayed his parents trust by doing something crazy like sneaking into the hallway at night to play with the ice machine. But there are still three more days before checkout, and the temptation is there. Good luck, Taylor. Youre going to need it. "

According to an announcement from the U.S. Sludge Warden today, the sludge will be on its way soon, and unfortunately, it doesnt look like theres anything we can do about it. The Sludge Warden warned in a press conference that the sludge is showing signs of unrest and will likely arrive any day now. Weve been carefully monitoring the situation, and what were seeing right now are conditions that are highly conducive to the sludges return, the Sludge Warden said. At this point, theres not much we can do to contain itits really just a matter of time. Do not try to run, for no man, woman, or child can escape the sludge, he continued. The sludge will envelop us all. If the circumstances werent already alarming enough, the Sludge Warden cautioned that there will be no way to predict the manner of the sludges arrival. Whether from north or south, east or west, sky or sea, the sludges approach cannot be foreseen. All that is certain is that its coming. Until the sludge does appear, the Sludge Warden is urging all Americans to take basic precautions to safeguard against its ravages, such as burying heirlooms, releasing pets back into the wild, and wrapping children and elderly in garbage bags.

Things may not end well for one content creator, whose painstaking scene-by-scene mashup of The Godfather with the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack has director Francis Ford Coppola thirsty for vengeance.

Shortly after the Donkey KongGodfather cut went up online, the 76-year-old reportedly hit the road with a toolbox and an attach case in his passenger seat, headed east. That was three days ago; he hasnt been seen or heard from since.

While poll respondents supported quarantining more than a dozen cable-news personalities, including the entire cast of Fox & Friends, a full seventy-two per cent gave the nod to a quarantine of Blitzer. At the Centers for Disease Control, a spokesman said that a Blitzer quarantine was very much on the table, and that the C.D.C. had come up with a workable plan. Essentially, we would do a lockdown of The Situation Room and provide Wolf with food and water until the crisis passes, he said. "

0,"Concerned that her endorsement of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for President would lead to cheap, easy jokes and innuendo, porn star Jenna Jameson held a press conference today to explain her headline-making decision. When asked what initially appealed to her about Mr. Romney, Ms. Jameson said, Hes the only person whos assumed more positions than I have. The actress said that she researched Mr. Romneys career thoroughly, and was particularly impressed by his tenure at Bain Capital: Theres nothing more American, I think, than screwing people you dont know for money. While Mr. Romneys recent foreign trip drew jeers from his critics, Ms. Jameson hailed his performance: I respect someone who opens their mouth without thinking. The actress, who appeared as the character Holly So Tightly in the film Dirt Merchant, seemed unconcerned by the controversy swirling about Mr. Romneys bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caymans: Ive put my assets in plenty of foreign places. Ms. Jameson concluded her presser by reiterating her fulsome support of the G.O.P. candidate: Mitt Romney will do to all of America what I have already done to half of America. "
0,"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia lashed out at the cable network A&E today, calling its decision to suspend Phil Robertson, the star of the TV series Duck Dynasty, unconstitutional, and demanding that it be overturned at once. Speaking at a press conference with fellow Justice Clarence Thomas, a visibly angry Scalia told reporters that Robertson was exercising his First Amendment right to express an opinionan opinion, I might add, that many other great Americans agree with. He warned that the suspension of the Duck star would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech in America: If Phil Robertson can be muzzled for expressing this perfectly legitimate view, whats to prevent the same thing from happening to, say, a Justice of the Supreme Court? He added that, while he was a huge Duck Dynasty fan who never misses an episode, his objection to Mr. Robertsons suspension was purely on Constitutional grounds. Declaring that A&Es decision will not stand, Justice Scalia said he would ask the Supreme Court to meet in an emergency session to overturn it: This offensive decision by A&E is a clear violation of the Constitution, and Im not the only one on the Court who feels that way. Right, Clarence? Justice Thomas had no comment. "
0,"In a stunning decision on the future of health care in America, the Supreme Court decided today that annual physicals were unconstitutional and should be replaced by random strip searches conducted by the nations police. The decision, which appeared to expand the role of the police to include such duties as performing breast and prostate exams, took many in both the health-care and law-enforcement communities by surprise. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, While the Constitution makes no provisions for health care, it explicitly defends the peoples right to form militias; clearly, the Founders believed that if anyone should be looking up our asses it shouldnt be a doctor, but someone with a gun. By replacing annual checkups with random strip searches, the Court raised worries in the health-care community that patients would not get the care they need, but those concerns were brushed aside by Justice Samuel Alito. Ultimately, the responsibility to secure adequate medical attention falls to the citizen, he said. When a policeman is searching his body cavities, for example, its up to the citizen to say, Theres a mole Id like you to look at. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he was personally ready for a random strip search/exam at any moment, adding, Ive got nothing on under this robe. "
0,"In what Romney campaign insiders are hailing as a sign that the party faithful are rallying around the former Massachusetts Governor, a new poll released today shows that a majority of Republican voters agree with the statement, I guess I have to support fucking Romney. When asked why they were now ready to cast their votes for Mr. Romney, a majority of those Republicans polled strongly agreed with the statement, Why do you think? No one else is fucking running anymore. Stop asking such stupid fucking questions. I dont need this shit. Underscoring the sense that he is now the presumptive nominee, the Romney campaign unveiled a new slogan this morning, You Have No Other Options Anymore. Start Dealing With It, Losers. After sweeping five primary states Tuesday night, Mr. Romney was exultant, telling supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, I love American democracy. Im good friends with the owners of it. The wins by Mr. Romney forced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to suspend his campaign, telling reporters that he was leaving the race to spend more time with my families. As for former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, he offered Mr. Romney this endorsement during an appearance on CNN: Yeah, I guess I support him, because, well, duh, I have absolutely no other choice. Right? I mean, really, Piers, what kind of moronic question is that? I guess this goes to show that you can be a total douchebag and still win the nomination if you have the most dough. I mean, come onthis whole situation makes me want to throw up. My only consolation is that on Judgment Day Im going to Heaven, and well have to see what happens to Mr. Magic Underpants. Ha ha. Yeah.

0,"Donald Trump, the Republican Presidential front-runner, touched off a firestorm of controversy on Wednesday by suggesting that, if elected, he would build a wall inside the uterus. In proposing an addition to the uterus, a major female reproductive sex organ, Trump sought to draw a distinction between such a wall and the wall that the uterus already has, commonly referred to as the uterine wall. No, no, no, this would be a much better wall than that wall, Trump said. People are going to love this wall. As has been his custom on the campaign trail, Trump offered few details about his plan to build a wall inside the uterus, other than to say that he would make women pay for it. Watch: A comic short about breaking up with your therapist. "
0,"The Democrats who participated in the first Democratic Presidential debate of the 2016 campaign garnered a scathing review from the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who said that none of them offered a concrete plan to protect the Earth from an invasion of bloodthirsty alien dragons. A swarm of marauding dragons with the capacity to shoot flames a thousand feet or more could destroy life on this planet as we know it, Carson told Fox News. And yet not a single one of these Democrats has apparently given any thought to such a threat. While the Republican Presidential candidate acknowledged that the Democrats in Las Vegas tangled over such issues as guns, Syria, and income inequality, he said, I did not hear the word dragon once. If I am elected President, I will gather the greatest minds in technology to design and build a dome made of dragon-proof material, he said. As a backup plan, in the event of a dragon attack, I would attempt to convince the dragons to attack Mars instead. Carson said that, of all of the men and women running for President, he was best prepared to protect the United States from dragons. This is the problem that keeps me up at night, he said. "
0,"Businessman Donald Trumps failure to insult fellow G.O.P. hopeful John Kasich a full twenty-four hours after the Ohio governor entered the 2016 Presidential race has sent Trumps poll numbers plummeting, as many supporters expressed a sudden loss of confidence in the real-estate mogul. Trumps Kasich gaffe occurred at a campaign rally in Des Moines on Wednesday, when the former reality-show star admitted that he did not yet know enough about the Ohio governor to properly insult him. I could get up here and call Kasich a loser, because my gut tells me thats what he is, but youve come to expect something more special out of me, Trump said. If you bear with me, I promise you that Ill come up with a world-class insult that we can all be proud of. The audience reacted with stunned silence, leading some observers to question whether Trumps failure to insult Kasich would turn from a mere gaffe into a full-blown scandal. Carol Foyler, a Trump supporter who attended the Des Moines event, said that she still liked Trump because of the insults he had delivered in the past, but she acknowledged that her belief in him had been shaken. When youre in the White House and that phone rings, youve got to be ready to insult someone right away, she said. "
0,"Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is on pace to adopt rival Bernie Sanderss positions on all major issues by noon on Thursday, Clinton campaign officials have confirmed. Within minutes of Sanderss entry into the Democratic race, Clinton released position papers on trade, income inequality, national defense, and the environment that meticulously aped the Vermont senators views on those matters. Awaking at 8 A.M., Sanders, who had planned to run to the left of Clinton in 2016, discovered that, while he was sleeping, she had already begun running slightly to the left of him. In an online video posted Thursday morning, Clinton welcomed Sanders to the race, adding, To those who agree with Bernie Sanders on the issues, let me say this: I am Bernie Sanders. Sanders, who had scheduled a speech in Vermont for 11 A.M. on Thursday, cancelled it abruptly, saying, Hillary already said everything I was going to say an hour ago. The Vermont politician told reporters that now he was unsure whether he would even continue with his campaign. I dont know anymore, he said, visibly shaken. I just dont know. "
0,"Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin doubled down on his controversial remarks about the female body today, proposing a prominent national-security role for the uterus. From what I understand, theres nothing that the uterus doesnt know, Rep. Akin told a reporter on KTVI-TV. Its almost like Spider-Mans spidey sense, if you will, except the tingling goes on down in the lady parts. Rep. Akin said that given the uterus extraordinary powers of detection, the female reproductive system should be Americas secret weapon in the war on terror. If we posted a uterus at every airport and a bunch of them along the border, I would just love to see an evildoer get past defenses like that, he said. Not gonna happen, folks. Nothing fools a uterus. Rep. Akin closed his interview with what he called the highest praise and respect for the female reproductive system. Not a day goes by that I dont wish I was as smart as a uterus, he said. "
0,"Calling the results of todays Iowa straw poll alarming, Standard and Poors took the unprecedented action of downgrading Iowas I.Q. While the effects of such an extraordinary measure are hard to predict, experts say the I.Q. downgrade could result in Iowans having difficulty completing sentences or operating a television remote. This downgrade would be very upsetting to Republicans in Iowa, said an S. & P. spokesman. Fortunately, theres no way theyll understand it. The winner in the straw poll, Representative Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.), gave a rousing victory speech that was simulcast in English across the state. But there may be tough sledding ahead for Representative Bachmann, as a new poll shows her losing support to Texas Governor Rick Perry among voters who describe themselves as morons. Governor Perry kicked off his Presidential campaign today in South Carolina, unveiling a new stump speech in which he promised to repeal the twentieth century. "
0,"In a new effort to settle nagging questions about his finances, Republican Presidential pick Mitt Romney today told reporters that his dog ate his tax returns and also served as C.E.O. of Bain Capital from 1999 to 2002. Mr. Romneys narrative about the Irish setter Seamus Romney, shared with reporters during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, was perhaps the most emotional invocation of a pet by a politician since Richard M. Nixons famed Checkers speech of 1952. Seamus was more than a dog, Mr. Romney said, his voice beginning to quaver. As C.E.O. of Bain, he was a job creator. But Mr. Romneys revelations about his dogs career in private equity may have raised more questions than it answered, as a spokesperson for People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) questioned the G.O.P. candidates latest version of events. If we are to believe Mitt Romney, in 2002 while Seamus was supposedly running Bain Capital he would have been at least 140 years old [in dog years], said PETAs Carol Foyler. This shaggy-dog story represents Mitt Romneys latest act of animal cruelty. Minutes after PETAs response, Mr. Romney released an amended statement, saying that Seamus Romney had served as C.E.O. of Bain posthumously. It was a quieter day for Mr. Romneys wife Ann, who, after her you people gaffe on ABCs Good Morning America yesterday, was seen riding home on the roof of Mr. Romneys car. "
0,"Across the United States on Wednesday, a heated national debate began on the extremely complex issue of children firing military weapons. Every now and then, the nation debates an issue that is so complicated and tricky it defies easy answers, says pollster Davis Logsdon. Letting small children fire automatic weapons is such an issue. Logsdon says that the thorny controversy is reminiscent of another ongoing national debate, about whether it is a good idea to load a car with dynamite and drive it into a tree. Many Americans think its a terrible idea, but others believe that with the correct supervision, its perfectly fine, he says. Whos to say whos right? Similar, he says, is the national debate about using a flamethrower indoors. There has been a long and contentious national conversation about this, he says. Its another tough one. Much like the long-running national debates about jumping off a roof, licking electrical sockets, and gargling with thumbtacks, the vexing question of whether children should fire military weapons does not appear headed for a swift resolution. Like the issue of whether you should sneak up behind a bear and jab it with a hot poker, this wont be settled any time soon, he says. "
0,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said on Tuesday that he feels snubbed by the decision of forty-seven Republican senators to write a letter to Iran but not to him, the official North Korean news agency reported. In an unusually forthcoming interview with the Korean Central News Agency (K.C.N.A.), Kim said it was hurtful that the Republicans would send a letter to one of the United States most longstanding enemies while totally snubbing another. Lets just call it what it is: theyre playing favorites with enemies, Kim said. I try not to take things personally, but its hard to see them sending letters to Iran without feeling a little bit hurt. Kim said that over the past two days he had his aides checking his mailbox on an hourly basis in hopes of finding a letter from the Republicans, but now he has pretty much given up hope. Honestly, I thought Id at least rate a text or something, but , he said, his voice trailing off. I dont like to beat myself up, but part of me is like, What does Iran have that I dont have? he said. I dont know. Sometimes I feel like, when you actually get nuclear weapons, people start taking you for granted. "
0,"In the strongest sign to date that he intends to seek the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has officially resigned his position as George W. Bushs brother. No longer being related to his brother is a key step to clearing Jebs path to the nomination, an aide said on New Years Day. We expect his poll numbers to soar on this. According to the aide, the former Florida governor resigned his post as brother in a ten-minute phone call with George W. Bush, after which he blocked the former Presidents phone number and e-mail address. In an official statement, George W. Bush said that he understands and supports his former brothers decision. If I were him, I would no longer be related to me either, he said. "
0,"After eleven years of writing nothing but fake news at the selfnews, I have to tell you something that actually happened. Im excited to announce that The New Yorker has acquired the selfnews. Starting today, the column will be moving to its new home at newyorker.com. Longtime selfnews readers might ask: how will moving to The New Yorker, known for its excruciating fact-checking, change the selfnews, which is composed entirely of lies? The answer: not at all. The selfnews will be as inaccurate as always, and if I ever write something that turns out to be true you have my deepest apology and my promise that it wont happen again. Another question: what will happen to the selfnewss editorial independence? No worries on that score, either. David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, has assured me that I can write whatever I want as long as I dont make fun of Malcolm Gladwell. And now, if youll forgive me, Id like to say one last thing thats true. My mom, Helen Borowitz, who died this month at the age of eighty-three, loved The New Yorker all her life and introduced me to it when I was a little boy. Seeing the selfnews at The New Yorker would have made her so happy. I dedicate all my columns to her memory. "
0,"Just hours after the United States Senate voted to reverse key provisions of the Patriot Act, former President George W. Bush said that he regretted that the law had been partially repealed before he ever got a chance to read it. At the time when it was being passed and whatnot, people around the White House were saying it was a really good law, Bush said at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. I remember saying to myself, I really need to read that. Bush said that right after he signed the Patriot Act into law, I wrote on a little Post-It note, READ PATRIOT ACT. So it was definitely something I was meaning to do. But I guess it was one of those things I never did get around to. Now that the law has been partially reversed, Bush said, I suppose its a little late in the game to start reading it, but he indicated that he still might check it out just to see what all the fuss was about. I think they have it down at my Presidential library, so maybe one of these days Ill set aside some time and read it, he said, before adding, Ha ha, who am I kidding? Thats not gonna happen. "
0,"In an uncharacteristically emotional scene for the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, Mitt Romney today paid a surprise visit to his money in the Cayman Islands. Speaking in a bank vault surrounded by stacks of cash, Mr. Romney praised his money for the brave work you have done in the never-ending fight for freedom from federal income tax. Thanks to your hard work, losers around the world are envious of me, he added. For that I salute you. Stressing that his moneys mission in the Caymans was far from over, he refused to set any timetable for withdrawal. In a reference to his bid for the Presidency, Mr. Romney told his money, It would be an honor and a privilege to have my face on you someday. After plunging into the stacks of cash to touch many of the dollar bills individually, Mr. Romney boarded his private jet to pay a surprise visit to Switzerland. In other political news, Newt Gingrich suspended his Presidential bid today, telling reporters, A campaign is like a wife. When its on life-support, its time to leave. "
0,"In an effort to underscore his core beliefs leading up to this Tuesday nights primary contests, former Senator Rick Santorum made a campaign swing through the seventeenth century today. At the first stop of his ambitious journey, Mr. Santorum restated his reason for seeking the White House: I am running for President today because the position of Spanish Inquisitor is no longer available. The former Pennsylvania senator served up red meat to his seventeenth-century supporters, telling them, Since we all agree that contraception is a bad idea, its time to take a harder look at electricity and soap. Mr. Santorum, who said that in his first day in office he would repeal the Age of Enlightenment, stressed that he had home-schooled all seven of his children: That means there are at least eight people in this country who dont understand evolution. In a lighter moment, Senator Santorum told his audience what he said was his favorite joke: A Kenyan, a Muslim, and a socialist walk into a bar. And then he makes everyone get an abortion. Elsewhere on the campaign trail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich scored points with this comment on education: We should leave no child behind, only wives. "

Responding to quizzical looks from his fellow Justices, Scalia related a little-known chapter from his career, when he briefly worked for the copying establishment in the mid-nineteen-seventies. They were pretty uptight, he reminisced. It seemed like every time I opened my mouth I got hauled into H.R. According to Justice Scalia, The gal in Human Resources told me, Nino, you cant just go around insulting blacks and women and whatnot. Theres not a workplace in the country that will tolerate that. Well, guess what? She was rightuntil I got this job, he chuckled. But even as he expressed gratitude for the freedom to offend gays, minorities, and women in his current position, Mr. Scalia admitted, It has basically spoiled me for life in the real world. Ill be at some ballgame shooting my mouth off, and suddenly Im face down in the ground with someones foot up my ass, he said. And then Ill have to remind myself, Nino, if youve got something to say, save it for the Supreme Court. "

The election meant the end of the road for Mr. Romney, who had been actively seeking the Presidency for the past sixty-five years. Addressing supporters at the Boston Convention Center, Mr. Romney called his defeat tonight bittersweet: On one hand, I lost the election. But on the other hand, Ill never have to show anyone my taxes. If he had won tonight, Mr. Romney would have become the first man elected President after telling half of the country to screw themselves. Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan addressed the subject of his defeat in characteristic style, telling supporters that he had won. "
0,"Brain surgeons, long burdened with the onerous reputation of being among the smartest people in the world, are expressing relief that the Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson is shattering that stereotype once and for all. In interviews with brain surgeons across the country, the doctors revealed the enormous pressure they felt to live up to their professions inflated renown for intelligence before Carson entered the race. When people found out I was a brain surgeon they would always assume I was some kind of a genius, said Harland Dorrinson, a neurosurgeon in Toledo, Ohio. Now they are beginning to understand that you can know a lot about brain surgery and virtually nothing about anything else. Dorrinson said that acquaintances used to view him as a source of wisdom on a wide range of subjects, but added, Ever since Ben Carson said that prisons make people gay, thats really fallen off. The brain surgeon said that he would probably contribute to Carsons campaign to keep him in the race: every time he says something, it helps bring peoples unrealistic expectations about brain surgeons back down to earth. He said that he was cheered by Carsons pronouncement over the weekend that Muslims should not be President. Now you can cross politics off the list of things that people will expect me to be knowledgeable about, he said. I think I speak for a lot of brain surgeons when I say, Thank you, Ben Carson. Watch: Bob Mankoff gets sweaty and answers a reader question about nuts. "
0,"In a covert mission designed to destroy what remains of Al Qaeda, the C.I.A. has been infiltrating the terror network with executives from JPMorgan Chase, the banking giant. The mission, which the intelligence agency had hoped to keep secret, came to light this week when Al Qaeda dismissed two of its top officials who it said were responsible for unacceptably speculative betting of the terror nets funds on credit-default swaps. Across the intelligence community, the dismissals caught the attention of analysts, who thought such risky behavior seemed out of character for Al Qaeda. The first thing I thought was, this sounds more like the work of JPMorgan, one analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Al Qaeda has a reputation for being madmen, but even for them these investments were crazy. Pressed about the covert mission, C.I.A. Director David Petraeus confirmed today that it had been a resounding success, telling reporters, If youre serious about putting someone out of business, theres no one better than these JPMorgan guys. One of them can do more damage than a thousand drone strikes. But General Petraeus may have spoken too soon, as the official Al Qaeda Web site today claimed that the terror organization was on the brink of getting a major financial bailout package from a consortium of state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran and North Korea. Al-Qaeda is too big to fail, the Web site said. "
0,"In a historic Oval Office ceremony on Thursday morning, President Barack Obama signed an executive order closing Congress, effective immediately. The President said that the move would dramatically increase the efficiency of the federal government, noting how much he had accomplished since he stopped working with Congress in November. Additionally, he said, the elimination of Congress would result in annual savings of more than five billion dollars, which Obama said would be refunded to American taxpayers. Acknowledging that some sticklers would argue that the Constitution calls for three branches of government, the President said, All this order does is reduce that number by one. The initial public reaction to the Presidents decision appeared to be overwhelmingly positive, as news of the executive order sent his approval rating soaring to seventy-nine percent. Asked by reporters if he had any message for members of Congress, the President said, I got it from here. "

Like many Americans, I was shocked and disgusted by the Senate Intelligence Committees publication of a torture report today, Cheney said in a prepared statement. The transparency and honesty found in this report represent a gross violation of our nations values. The publication of torture reports is a crime against all of us, he added. Not just those of us who have tortured in the past, but every one of us who might want to torture in the future. Saying that the Senates horrifying publication had inspired him to act, he vowed, As long as I have air to breathe, I will do everything in my power to wipe out the scourge of torture reports from the face of the Earth. Cheney concluded his statement by calling for an international conference on the issue of torture reports. I ask all the great nations of the world to stand up, expose the horrible practice of publishing torture reports, and say, This is not who we are, Cheney said. "

The White Supremacist Labelling Act of 2015 would require white supremacists to wear 4-inch-by-6-inch name tags clearly designating them as members of an official hate group. Right now, its impossible to tell the difference between neo-Nazis and collectors of WWII memorabilia, Scalise said. The Louisiana congressman said that proper labelling for white supremacists should make it easier for lawmakers to know what kind of organizations they are addressing in the future. Sometimes its hard to see through all that smoke from the burning crosses, he acknowledged. "
0,"Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney told supporters on Friday that he was incredibly relieved to be able to keep the approximately five to ten residences he owns across the country. Having to talk about how much I care about ordinary Americans and so forthI was game for that, he said. But having to sell all of those houses? That was going to be brutal. The 2012 Republican nominee said that he was especially glad he did not have to part with the car elevator in his eleven-thousand-square-foot mansion in La Jolla. Come on, that thing is neat, he said. "
0,"The United States of America is on the wrong track and no one is taking action to fix it, says a broad majority of registered voters who did not vote last Tuesday. According to a new survey, anger, frustration, and a pervasive view that the nation is moving in a fatal direction dominated the mood of those who were doing something other than voting on Election Day. Exit polls involving election non-participants took place as they left malls, nail salons, gyms, and other locations where no voting occurred on Tuesday. The system is broken, said Carol Foyler, thirty-one, a democracy abstainer from Akron, Ohio. We need to come up with some way that ordinary citizens can make their voices heard and have some impact on who is running things in Washington. The economy, jobs, and terrorism topped the list of worries that are preying on the minds of the non-voting electorate. I find it difficult to sleep at night worrying about the kind of country we are leaving to our children and our childrens children, said Mark Gardziak, forty-seven, who spent Election Day shopping for a phone. While pessimism about the future dominated the comments of the sixty-three per cent of American voters who elected not to exercise their democratic rights on Tuesday, some expressed a glimmer of hope. The one way things could get better is if we all get together and throw out the crooked politicians, offered Tess Shardin, thirty-eight, who said she was unlikely to vote in 2016. "
0,"In a Thursday appearance on the Fox News Channel, former Vice-President Dick Cheney said that it was no fair that President Obama gets to bomb Syria. Im envious as hell, he told Foxs Sean Hannity. That was on my bucket list. Asked if he had any advice for the President on bombing Syria, Cheney said, Just enjoy it. It doesnt get any better than this. The former Vice-President struck a philosophical note at the conclusion of his interview with Hannity. Look, I had a good run, he said. I got to bomb Afghanistan, and I got to do it to Iraqtwice. But to see someone finally get to bomb Syria and its not me? Id be lying if I said that didnt hurt like hell. "
0,"Human beings are more closely related to Neanderthals than originally thought, scientists confirmed today. According to Professor Davis Logsdon, the chairman of the genetic science department at the University of Minnesota, the level of Neanderthal genes in a human may vary from person to person. There are certain humans walking among us who are passing as humans but are really Neanderthals in human clothing, if you will, he said. He urged caution, however, in attributing brutish, beastly, or savage behavior to the amount of Neanderthal genes one possesses. Thats really unfair to Neanderthals, he added. "
0,"Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted President Obama on Saturday for failing to bomb Stonehenge while in the United Kingdom for the NATO summit. This is a time when its important to send our enemies the message that the United States is strong, McCain told Fox News. I can think of no better way to do that than by blowing Stonehenge off the map. McCain said that he was astounded by Obamas reluctance to order airstrikes on the ancient monument. He had a clean shot at Stonehenge, and he blinked, he said. "
0,"In a rare announcement from a notoriously publicity-shy group, Chinese hackers revealed today that they were dropping the United States government from their official list of high-value targets. We have to allocate our time and energy to hacking powerful organizations, a spokesman for the hackers said. Right now, calling the United States government an organization would be a reach. He added that the hackers ultimate goal had been to hurl the U.S. government into a state of abject paralysis, and they seem to have already taken care of that on their own. The spokesman acknowledged that despite years of compromising U.S. government computers, the hackers had obtained little of value, especially on the hard drives of congressional offices. Those computers did not appear to be used for anything work-related, the spokesman said. Basically all we found were restaurant reservations and porn. U.S. stock markets plummeted on the news of the hackers downgrade, which was widely denounced by American politicians as a hostile act designed to cripple the economy. This is an insult to the American people, said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia). We demand that the Chinese resume hacking us at once. But according to the hackers spokesman, any chance that they might put the U.S. government back on their list of targets was remote at best. We need to focus on higher-functioning governments, he said. Were taking a close look at Venezuela. "

0,"The Vermont Senator Bernie Sanderss potential bid for the 2016 Presidency was declared over, on Monday, before it even began, because of a key feature of the American political system that makes a person with integrity ineligible for the White House. According to some experts, the electoral system has developed a number of safeguards over the past few decades to prevent someone with independence and backbone from occupying the Presidency. Bernie Sanderss failure to become a member of either major political party excludes him from the network of cronyism and backroom deals required under our system to be elected, said Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. Though that failure alone would disqualify Sanders, the fact that he is not beholden to a major corporate interest or investment bank would also make him ineligible. Because of his ineligibility, Logsdon said, the Vermont Senator would be unable to fund-raise the one billion dollars required under the current system to run for President. The best source of a billion dollars is billionaires, and Sanders has alienated them, he said. Clearly he didnt think this through. Logsdon said that Sanders might persist in his quest for the White House despite his ineligibility but that such an effort would be doomed to fail. Our political system has been refined over the years specifically to keep people like Bernie Sanders out of the White House, he said. The system works. "
0,"In what historians are calling an unprecedented development in American politics, both major parties decided today to cancel the 2012 election. The decision to scrap the 2012 contest came on the heels of a new poll showing President Barack Obama with an approval rating of a hundred per cent, believed to be a record high for an American President. Mr. Obama even polled well among Republicans, with a majority of G.O.P. voters agreeing with the statement, I no longer care that he wasnt born here. The new bipartisan spirit sweeping the nation was captured well by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), who tearfully told reporters, This is a great day for America oh, leave me alone, goddamn it. Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump made no official announcement, but sources said he was considering running for Prime Minister of Canada. The cancellation of the election comes in the aftermath of the death of Osama bin Laden, whose last words reportedly were, I knew I shouldnt have signed up for Foursquare. Of all the major news networks, Fox News did not report news of bin Ladens death, saying that it would air cartoons until further notice. In Libya, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi issued the following official statement: Uh-oh. In North Korea, President Kim Jong-il said this: I have lost my last friend on Facebook. And in Wasilla, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said this: We must find and kill Osama bin Laden. "
0,"One day after the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina announced her candidacy for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination, a new poll shows that she enjoys extremely high name recognition among the tens of thousands of former H.P. employees she fired. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, Fiorinas name recognition stands at a hundred per cent among the legions of employees she terminated, with many of them calling the former C.E.O. unforgettable. Additionally, a broad majority of the laid-off workers described their feelings about Fiorina as intense, and noted that very few days go by when they do not invoke her name in a vehement manner. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the survey for the University of Minnesota, said that Fiorinas entry into the Republican race had energized many former H.P. employees. Most of them were apathetic about the race before, but now they are very excited to see how it plays out for Carly Fiorina, he said. Impressively, Fiorinas hundred-per-cent name recognition among fired H.P. employees ranks her ahead of other names mentioned in the survey, such as Darth Vader (ninety-nine per cent) and Satan (ninety-seven per cent).

0,"A nation that waited several decades for health insurance is becoming increasingly infuriated by a Web site that is wasting minutes of its time, reports from across the United States confirm. The official Web site of Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, has been plagued by glitches, crashes, and sluggishly loading pages, say millions of angry Americans attempting to log on to the site at exactly the same time. Look, I know that we had to wait longer for health care than virtually every other industrialized nation on earth, said Tracy Klugian, a muffler salesman from Akron, Ohio. But the time I spent on that Web site is thirty-five minutes Ill never get back. Sharing what he called his Obamacare horror story, Mr. Klugian said, Being on that Web site slowed down our wi-fi so much that my kids couldnt stream videos. For a so-called health-care program, its causing a lot of stress thats the opposite of healthy, if you ask me. Harland Dorrinson, a gym manager from Knoxville, Tennessee, had an Obamacare nightmare of his own, having to log on to the site two completely different times before getting health insurance for the first time in his life. President Obama said he was going to make health care affordable and available to millions of Americans, he said, bitterly. He didnt tell us it would take more than an hour. "
0,"Official Washington was in celebration mode on New Years Day after kind of averting a completely unnecessary crisis that was entirely of its own creation. This deal proves that if we all procrastinate long and hard enough, we can semi-solve any self-inflicted problem at the very last minute in a way that satisfies no one, said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). But even as Sen. McConnell basked in self-congratulation, he warned Congress against the complacency that could come with having sort of fixed its own completely avoidable mess. This is a new year, and much work remains to be done, he said. Its up to us to concoct entirely new optional disasters that we will have to undo at some later date in a more or less half-assed way. In a related story, an arsonist received an award for putting out his own fire. "
0,"Watching the news can make it easy to think that people are inherently selfish and hopeless, but every once in a while theres a story that proves that good people do exist! When the Curiosity Mars rover got lodged helplessly in a ditch, a complete stranger leapt into action and brought the module to safety. Simply incredible. Faith in humanity restored! At around 4:30 p.m. EST last Friday, the Mars rover was performing a soil analysis as scheduled when it moved too far forward and listed into a ditch. The next breathless moments in mission control were spent trying to maneuver the rover back to safety, but it soon became clear that it could not get out on its own power. Hopelessness began to set in. Then something amazing happened: An unidentified man selflessly rushed to pull the Mars rover out of the ditch. This nameless hero didnt stick around for glory or a reward after making sure that the rover was all right; he just continued on with his day. Due to the 14-minute transmission lag from Mars to Earth, by the time Curiositys camera could be turned around to identify the man, he was long gone. The $2.5 billion machine was in peril 140 million miles from Earth, but thanks to one incredible good Samaritan, the mission is back on track! It was amazing to see this guy spring into action, said NASA chief engineer Ralph Roe. He could have just as easily walked on by without helping, but he chose to stop and assist the rover. I wish I knew his name so I could thank him. Thanks to this anonymous knight in shining armor, the Curiosity rover can continue its important search for evidence of water and micro-bacterial life on Mars. NASA salutes you, and so do we! "
0,"Apple rocked the gadget world today with the news that the iPhone 5 includes a new feature that gives shape and purpose to previously empty and meaningless lives. As Apple explained at its launch of the device, the new feature is an improved version of its personal assistant, Siri, that has been endowed with a quality missing from the previous model: empathy. In a demonstration before a hushed crowd of Apple enthusiasts, an app developer named Josh asked the new Siri, Why didnt my parents love me? Siris response, Your parents were too self-absorbed and narcissistic to recognize your essential beauty and value as a human being, brought many in the Yerba Buena Center audience close to tears. Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook closed out the launch with perhaps his boldest claim to date about the companys new phone: We believe that the iPhone 5 will make your current relationship obsolete. Wall Street rallied on the news, with tech analysts expecting millions of Apple customers to purchase an iPhone 5 to replace their existing boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse. But in the words of Apple devotee Tracy Klugian, who was present at todays launch, such expectations are overdone: Most Apple snobs I know started putting their Apple products before their relationships a long time ago.

0,"In a stunning bid for a political comeback, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said today that he was considering running for office in New York City. Mr. Berlusconi announced his intentions after several local polls showed him with a higher approval rating than the candidates currently on offer in the city. For the disgraced former Prime Minister, the chance to start over again in New York is like a dream come true. In Italy, you make one little mistake, they throw you in jail seven years, he said. New Yorkers are much more forgiving. Mr. Berlusconi said that he had not yet decided what office to run for, but was leaning toward public advocate. Once they see how good Silvio does at that, they make him mayor or governor, no? he said, with a booming laugh. Mr. Berlusconi said that he was unconcerned by rumors of a possible bid for office in New York by another former European politician, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Just let him try, he said. Do I look worried? I am not worried. I walk down street, people tell me thumbs up. New York loves Silvio. "
0,"Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney today released the following letter to the American people: Dear American People: Yesterday, comments I made about poor people made me look terrible. This always seems to happen when I say what I really believe. The fact is, I do care about poor people. Thats because Im poor myself, when you compare me to Mark Zuckerberg. According to most projections, Facebooks I.P.O. should net Mr. Zuckerberg a personal fortune of twenty-eight billion dollars. I couldnt make a pile of dough-re-mi like that even if I fired people twenty-four hours a day. Now, lets take a look at Mitt Romneys net worth: a measly two hundred million dollars. Now do you see why I consider myself poor? Compared to Mark Zuckerberg, Mitt Romney is practically a crack whore. Now, Im not going to sit here and envy a rich person like Mark Zuckerberg. Thats exactly what President Obama wants poor people like me to do. Mark Zuckerberg made his money fair and square, by creating useful products like imaginary sheep and angry birds. Say what you will about Facebook, it has totally revolutionized the way we waste our lives. The fact is, if youre poor in America, you should do what Mark Zuckerberg did: create a social network. Ive just started my own, called TwoFaceBook. With TwoFaceBook, your profile doesnt stay the same for more than two seconds. In closing, theres one more reason I dont worry about poor people. They have Groupons. Vote for me, Mitt Romney "
0,"In what critics are calling a desperate attempt to draw the medias attention away from Donald Trump, the other fifteen candidates for the Republican nomination have released a joint sex tape. The tape, including such luminaries as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Texas senator Ted Cruz, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, appeared briefly on major news Web sites before an avalanche of viewer revulsion demanded it be taken down. According to Carol Foyler, a viewer who happened to catch the tape during its brief appearance on the CNN Web site, the video contained images I may never be able to get out of my mind. I couldnt believe that these people would participate in such a thing, she said. Except maybe Santorum. A spokesman for Rick Perry defended the former Texas governors appearance on the tape. It changed the conversation, at least for a minute or two, the spokesman said. Possibly as a result of his exclusion from the sex tape, in the aftermath of its release Trump has surged another eleven points in the latest poll. Watch: The rule is simple: use fewer for items that can be counted, like beans, and less for things that cantbacon, say. "
0,"With 18 NBA All-Star selections, five league titles, and two Olympic gold medals under his belt, Kobe Bryant is hanging it up at the end of this season. As the future Hall of Famer plays the final games of his historic career, heres what stars from around the league are saying about one of the greatest Lakers of all time. Paul George Kobe was aggressive on the court, but a gentleman through and through. Hed ask everyone he was paired against, Did you have supper? What did you have for supper? Every game, from first quarter to last. And hed remember what you had too, years later. Ive never seen such a high level of sportsmanship. James Harden If it werent for Kobe, I wouldnt even know what a basketball is. I would have just assumed it was a big orange egg from The Flintstones that someone stole from Mr. Slate. Dwyane Wade I cant knock someone who dominated the court like that. That said, every time he took a shot, he would shout One more melon in the berry bowl! Ill give it to him that melons are fruits, but theyre definitely not berries. It didnt sit right with me. Kevin Garnett Kobe loved having nicknames for his opponents, but he gave everybody the same one. It was Cowboy. Tony Allen Kobe Bryant prepares better than anyone else in the league. I was guarding him a couple years ago, and he kept muttering a bunch of dates over and over. I looked them up later, and it turned out that they were the birthdays of all of my cousins. Dirk Nowitzki He has one of the most brilliant minds in basketball. Kobe once took me to a Johnny Rockets before a game and said, Dirk Nowitzki, you can have as many orders of chili cheese fries as you wantmy treat! I said, Kobe, youre not trying to get me bloated and disgusting before our game, are you? He was appalled that I would say such a thing. You are my best friend, Dirk Nowitzki, and I love you, he said. So I went to town on those chili cheese fries, and wouldnt you know it, I threw up all over the floor at the Staples Center and wanted to die. Tim Duncan He is the smartest player I have ever played against. He knows that the key to success on the court is to never think about how you are sweating in front of so many people. The league just wont be the same without him. "
0,"Attempting to repair some of the fallout from his recent remarks about women, Donald Trump said on Sunday that the decision of whether women should be considered humans should be left to the states. I wouldnt want to tell Texas whether women are humans, for example, he said on CBSs Face the Nation. They obviously have some very strong opinions about that. When asked point-blank whether he considered women humans, the billionaire responded, It should be a case-by-case thing. Trump also blasted the media for applying what he called a double standard to his remarks about women. I can call a woman a pig and its totally taken out of context, he said. Trumps latest comments drew a strong rebuke from his chief rival, Senator Ted Cruz, on the campaign trail in Wisconsin. Once again, Donald has utterly failed to find a subtle way to express the Republican Partys anti-woman views, he said. Watch: Meet the proud father of the Times Square fixture the Naked Cowboy. "
0,"Kim Jong-un, Supreme Leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, has issued the following letter to the citizens of the world: Dear World People: For decades, North Korea was threatened by hostile foes with nuclear weapons. With our safety constantly at risk from violent intruders, we asked: How can we possibly defend ourselves? In the immortal words of my dad, the glorious Kim Jong-il: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a nuke is a good guy with a nuke. I sleep safely at night knowing that a loaded nuclear silo is as close as the launch button on my nightstand. And now I understand what Dad, in his genius, instinctively knew: that the world will not be truly safe until every nation has nuclear weapons. Perhaps because these weapons are so necessary to our defense, the U.S. government, with its lapdogs at the United Nations, is plotting to take them away from us. But as Dad used to say, When they come for our nukes . That is why today I am founding the Nuclear Retaliation Association to defend the sovereign right of every nation on the planet to engulf that planet in a hellish inferno. If you join today, we will waive the initiation fee and send you this bumper sticker: Nuclear weapons dont kill people. People kill people who dont have nuclear weapons. Peace out, Kim Jong-un "
0,"House Speaker John Boehner today called for an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich, thus ending a streak of pretending to work with President Obama that lasted forty-eight hours. We knew he couldnt hold out much longer, said Carol Foyler of Guinness World Records. Still, John Boehner pretending to be bipartisan for forty-eight hours is pretty darn impressive, she said, noting that his previous record stood at twenty minutes. This is David Blaine territory for him. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Boehner downplayed the significance of his record-setting performance, saying merely, It just feels good being a dick again. "
0,"This wasnt how it was supposed to play out. For Cardinal Bonifacius Steuer, last night was supposed to be a time of celebration, when the Dutchman who had dreamed of being Pope ever since his boyhood days in Rotterdam would finally stand on the balcony at the Vatican, basking in the cheers of thousands of the euphoric faithful. There are no cheers for Bonifacius Steuer today. Only empty silence, and time to reflect on what might have been. Look, Im not going to lie to you, Cardinal Steuer said, in his first interview since his bruising defeat. It kills me not to be there, not to be in the Vatican doing what needs to be done. While Steuer said that he is not going to get into that whole blame-game thing, he sounded bitter when he spoke about the mainstream media. People werent allowed to see me for who I was, he said. They made me look like Im some rich, rich guy, when you know that Im as poor as a church mouse. But what closed the deal for Pope Francis, Steuer believes, was his outreach to the poor, which the Dutchman calls a failed policy of the past. Look, if you go around saying, the poor this, the poor that, youre going to get a lot of support from people who want free stuff, he said. Franciss campaign, if you will, focussed on giving targeted groups a big gift. Reflecting on the two-day conclave that chose someone else, Steuer was philosophical: We were on a roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride ends. And then you get off. And its not like, oh, cant we be on a roller coaster the rest of our life? Its like, no, the rides over. Steuer said its too early to talk about his future plans, but that he first intends to sit down with his closest advisers to reflect on what went wrong this time around. Im going to meet with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and Im going to be like, Come on, guys, dont hold back, he said. But even as he sounded an aggrieved note as he spoke about the hand I was dealt, Steuer seemed to reserve his harshest criticism for one person: himself. Look, at the end of the day, this is on me, he said. This was all about getting enough Catholic votes, and I didnt get it done. "

0,"At 8:13 p.m. on Monday, the credits of Halloween: Resurrection started to roll, and Joseph Condron dissolved into tears of joy. He had a good reason: At age 43, hed just made history, becoming the first human being ever to climb Mount Everest and watch all 10 installments in the Halloween horror film franchise. Incredible! Condrons feat is unique, unmatched by any mountain climber or film fan in history. To do it, Condron had to brave more than 29,000 vertical feet and 920 minutes of film, and thats not even considering the fact that descending Everest is often even harder than climbing it in the first place! Its no surprise that what Condron just did was long thought impossible. Others have come close. American mountaineer Ed Viesturs has climbed Everest seven times and seen 1995s Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers. The U.K.s Paul Noble has climbed Everest and seen an impressive six of the 10 Halloween movies. Still others have watched every single Halloween film but never made it to the top of Everest. All impressive in their own right, but now theyre making way for history. Condrons monumental achievement stands alone, and this incredible graphic only begins to suggest its scope: The most mind-blowing thing is that he did it at a time when there are more Halloween films in existence than ever before. Ten films and the tallest mountain on earth: It seems insane, and indeed, there were times it appeared Condron would come up short. When the Rob Zombiedirected Halloween was released in 2007, it was unclear if Condron would ever achieve the elusive goal. But it was then that Condron produced a stunning run of achievement: He watched the Rob Zombie reboot early the following year before knocking out Halloween III: Season Of The Witch (1982) in 2009, climbing Mount Everest for the first time in 2010, and seeing Rob Zombies Halloween II (2009) in 2012, leaving just Halloween: Resurrection (2002) standing between Condron and immortality. Then, in 85 awe-inspiring minutes last night, he finally did it. Condron watched Halloween: Resurrection, and in doing so, vaulted himself into a newly forged pantheon of one. Amazing. It just proves that when you dare to push the limits of what is possible, you can climb Mount Everest and see all 10 films in the Halloween franchise. Inspiring! "
0,"The United States of America, a nation with a population of approximately three hundred million people, totally accepts that the next President of the United States can only be selected from two families. In interviews conducted across the country, Americans acknowledged that, while the United States boasts many exceptional people in the fields of technology, business, public policy, and government, none will be offered to voters as candidates because they do not come from one of the two families deemed eligible. No doubt about it, there are a lot of great people out there who could be President, said Stoddard Vinton, of Toledo. But I guess our system of choosing people from just two families has worked out pretty well. Leslie McEdwards, of San Jose agreed, that, while it would be cool to choose a President from more than two families, on the plus side, we voters dont have to learn a bunch of new names. This country is facing unprecedented problems, and its going to take some fresh ideas to solve them, said Doug Chessing, of Grand Rapids. Ive got my fingers crossed that someone from one of those two families can do it. The fact that the current President, Barack Obama, belonged to neither of the families always felt kind of weird to me, said Halynn Cross, of Knoxville. He tried really hard and all, but, after eight years, itll be nice to get back to someone from the two families. In one of the strongest endorsements of Americas two-family system, Rick Keelins of Albany said that he is sick and tired of people complaining about it. At least we have two families to choose from, he said. A lot of countries, like North Korea, just have one. "
0,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has entered rehab to deal with his struggles with nouns and verbs, an aide to the congressman has confirmed. According to the aide, McCarthy abruptly dropped out of the race for Speaker of the House because his difficulties with those two parts of speech had spiralled out of control. There was an intervention, in which people who care about the congressman sat him down and showed him video of himself talking, the aide said. He agreed that he needed help, although it took people awhile to realize thats what he was trying to say. A source familiar with McCarthys struggles, however, cast doubt on that official story. Its not just nouns and verbs, the source said. Its adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. Kevins going to be in rehab for awhile. In a brief statement to reporters, McCarthy offered a blunt assessment of his situation. It bad, he said. But soon it be less badder. "
0,"Saying that he was sick and tired of having my medical credentials questioned, Governor Chris Christie (R-N.J.) had himself sworn in as a medical doctor on Sunday night. Dr. Christie acknowledged that becoming a doctor generally requires pre-med classes, four years of medical school, plus additional years of residency, but he said that the Ebola epidemic compelled him to take extraordinary measures, as we say in the medical profession. Dr. Christie said that, beginning on Monday, he would begin a series of random house calls to check New Jersey residents for Ebola and assign them for quarantine. I can usually diagnose someone with Ebola in under a minute, Dr. Christie said. Even faster if I dont actually see them. The doctor said that before moving forward with his plan to quarantine scores of New Jersey citizens he suspects of having Ebola, he consulted with other prominent epidemiologists, including Dr. Rick Perry, of Texas. He concurs, he said. Dr. Christie defended his quarantine plan against critics, noting that unorthodox procedures in medicine often face opposition at first. Were used to hearing that the nurses and doctors who treat Ebola patients are heroes, he said. But the real heroes are the people who lock up those heroes. "
0,"As the curtain comes down on the Michael Bloomberg era, the three-term mayor of New York received fulsome praise last night from his most appreciative constituency: the people who can still afford to live there. Harland Dorrinson, principal owner of the hedge fund Garrote Capital, hosted a black-tie dinner in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to pay tribute to a mayor who, in Mr. Dorrinsons words, put living in New York out of the reach of everyone except the deserving few. To a lot of people, Mike Bloomberg will be remembered for reducing smoking and improving peoples diets, said Mr. Dorrinson. But that shouldnt overshadow his greatest accomplishment, creating unaffordable housing throughout New York. When Mike took office, this city was teeming with regular working people, Mr. Dorrinson said, shuddering at the memory. Today, its a magnificent tapestry of investment bankers, real-estate developers, and Russian oligarchs. The hedge-fund owner is such a fan of Mr. Bloombergs, in fact, that he has only one bone to pick with him: that he left office too soon to finish the job. There are still a few pockets in the city where, regrettably, the middle class seems to be hanging on, he said. The rent is too damn low. As for Mr. Bloombergs critics, Mr. Dorrinson was philosophical: I know there are some people who think Mike was terrible for New York, that he took a city rich with diversity and ruined it. But fortunately, they all live somewhere else now. "
0,"G.O.P. Presidential nominee Mitt Romney finally got some good news today as he found himself ahead of President Obama in a poll of N.F.L. replacement referees. The survey, which immediately lifted the spirits of the Romney campaign, was taken among replacement refs on the field during N.F.L. games that they were supposed to be officiating last Sunday and Monday. According to the poll, if the election were held today the replacement refs would have Mr. Romney beating President Obama by a score of 14-12. By a wide majority, the replacement refs strongly agreed with the statement, Im pretty sure Im right about this but I need to talk it over with some other people first. "
0,"New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner stirred controversy today by continuing to send dirty texts throughout a press conference devoted to apologizing for his behavior. Mr. Weiner was halfway through his apology when reporters noticed him remove a phone from his pocket and aim its camera lens unmistakably in the direction of his pants. After seeing the candidate snap a photo of the pants region and then send a text, reporters bombarded Mr. Weiner with questions, asking him if he had in fact just sexted. Yes, I did, but I swear this was the last time, he said. This behavior is now behind me. Mr. Weiner then concluded his press conference by removing his shirt and snapping a quick shot of his naked torso. According to the latest New York City poll, Mr. Weiner still has a commanding lead among voters who describe themselves as pervs. "
0,"From the destruction of sacred cultural sites to the brutal murder of innocent civilians, ISIS has proven itself time and again to be an organization without mercy and without a conscience, and its most recent devastating attack only continues its reign of brutality. This morning, ISIS released a video containing footage of the beloved sitcom Friends with the laugh track replaced by an unknown voice making unkind remarks about Ross. The footage is truly horrific, and it shows just how far the terrorist group is willing to go. You can watch the video below, but viewer discretion is advised: Truly awful. The Islamic State has once again demonstrated its unrelenting depravity, and we can only hope that someone puts a stop to its reign of terror someday soon. "
0,"An Ohio mans fascination with the so-called fiscal cliffand his steadfast refusal to talk about anything elsehas alienated everyone close to him, former friends of the man say. Harland Dorrinson, a forty-one-year-old carpet-tile salesman and self-described fiscal-cliff nut has turned himself into a pariah with his inexplicable interest in the most tedious conversation topic ever. We were all like, Harland, every time you talk about this, people start to lose consciousness, says Carol Foyler, a former friend who has cut ties with Mr. Dorrinson over his fiscal-cliff obsession. I dont know what effect the fiscal cliff will have in January, but if youre stuck in a conversation with Harland the effect is you want to drown yourself. For his part, Mr. Dorrinson says that his ex-friends who have shown no interest in the fiscal cliff are a bunch of losers who dont know what theyre missing. I guess there are people out there who arent interested in whether capital-gains taxes and marginal rates will rise, or which Republicans have backed away from Grover Norquists anti-tax pledge, he says. But seriously, would you want to be friends with someone like that? Or, for that matter, married to one? If Mr. Dorrinson has a regret, it is that the fiscal-cliff issue will be resolved one way or the other by the end of the year: I know Im going to experience a profound feeling of loss when its gone. There hasnt been anything this fascinating since the debt-ceiling debate. Tickets for Andy Borowitzs next live show are now on sale. "
0,"Few schools had it harder than Coleridge Elementary in Detroit. For years, dwindling budgets made it impossible for the school to buy supplies like new textbooks or computers, and faculty cutbacks resulted in class sizes of more than 30 students per teacher. But theres finally some good news for this struggling school: A wealthy timpani player donated $60 million to help them build a world-class timpani program. What an incredible gesture! The philanthropist is Eric Gustav, a timpani enthusiast and heir to an immense fortune who saw a problem he knew he could fix. Before his amazing gift, Coleridge Elementarys timpani program consisted of one decimated timpani with only a single mallet that all 900 students had to share, far below the national average. But now, the school ranks first in timpani education, and its all thanks to one man. Growing up, I never needed to worry about whether I would have access to a timpani or not, explained Eric during a public ceremony at the school. Every child should have the blessing of timpanis in their lives, no matter how much money they have. So generous! The grant has already had a transformative effect on the schools timpani classes. Every single student will have access to a timpani of the highest quality that was manufactured in a 100-year-old Italian drum factory. Previously, the school employed a single music teacher, but now its been able to hire 25 full-time timpani tutors, as well as invite timpani guest speakers from leading philharmonics around the world. Best of all, the school was able to purchase an adjacent lot to build an 800-seat concert hall just for timpani practice and timpani recitals. Last week, things seemed hopeless for the students of Coleridge Elementary. But today, thanks to one mans magnanimous gift, things are finally looking up for these kids when it comes to playing the timpani. If you needed proof that good still exists in the world, here it is. Bravo! "
0,"Attempting to quell criticism of his proposal for a limited military mission in Syria, President Obama floated a more modest strategy today, saying that any U.S. action in Syria would have no objective whatsoever. Let me be clear, he said in an interview on CNN. Our goal will not be to effect rgime change, or alter the balance of power in Syria, or bring the civil war there to an end. We will simply do something random there for one or two days and then leave. I want to reassure our allies and the people of Syria that what we are about to undertake, if we undertake it at all, will have no purpose or goal, he said. This is consistent with U.S. foreign policy of the past. While Mr. Obama clearly hoped that his proposal of a brief and pointless intervention in Syria would reassure the international community, it immediately drew howls of protest from U.S. allies, who argued that two days was too open-ended a timeframe for such a mission. That criticism led White House spokesman Jay Carney to brief reporters later in the day, arguing that the President was willing to scale down the U.S. mission to twenty-four hours, thirty-six tops. It may take twenty-four hours, but it could also take twelve, Mr. Carney said. Maybe we get in there, take a look around, and get out right away. But however long it takes, one thing will not change: this mission will have no point. The President is resolute about that. "
0,"Some people just have all the luck, especially Jason and Brooke Ashby. This Philadelphia couple recently hit the jackpot when their modest two-bedroom house tripled in value after Billy Joel accidentally got his head glued to the porch. Cha-ching! The Piano Man himself was discovered early Saturday morning frantically trying to unstick his forehead from the front porch. But despite his best efforts, Joel was unable to break free, and once it became clear that he was irreversibly stuck, the Ashbys called an appraiser, who valued their home at more than three times what they bought it for! Ever since, the Ashby home has become the envy of the neighborhood, with neighbors dropping by at all hours to catch a glimpse of the rock-and-roll icon in the flesh. The idea of one day finding a music legend glued to our house didnt even cross our mind when we bought the place, said Jason, smiling from ear to ear. And not in our wildest dreams did we ever imagine it would be someone like Billy Joel. Its been an absolute godsend. Whether Joel is trying in vain to pry himself free or desperately lapping up rainwater, the six-time Grammy Award winner has already added an extra zero to the end of the propertys value. As for the Ashbys, they could sell now or wait to see if the price continues to skyrocket, but theres no denying that these are two of the luckiest people alive! "
0,"Contradicting their professed interest in creating jobs, Senate Republicans resolutely refused to put even one American to work this week. The Republicans, in fact, went to extreme lengths to prevent a single job from being filled, thus risking being called job-killers during an election year. You have a job opening and a highly qualified applicant, but youre blocking the applicant from taking the job? Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez said. That doesnt sound like youre very interested in creating jobs. While voters across the country questioned why Republicans would refuse to let even one American find employment, Washington insiders speculated that G.O.P. senators did not want to do anything to contribute to the improving jobs picture while Barack Obama is still President. Under President Obama, the economy has added over nine million jobs, one insider said. The last thing the Republicans want to do is give him credit for one more. According to Senate sources, the Republican leadership is hoping that the job applicant, a sixty-three-year-old male, will eventually become discouraged and give up looking for work. Watch: Many copy editors, journalists, grammarians, lexicographers, and linguists stand ready to embrace the singular their. But not us. "
0,"Amid some confusion as to whether it had, in fact, declared war on ISIS, on Friday afternoon, the White House attempted to clarify matters by vowing to use every synonym for war at our disposal. After the Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that the United States was not at war, only to be contradicted later by the White Houses statement that it was, the White House spokesman Josh Earnest held a press conference to state that no synonyms for war have been taken off the table. Yes, this is a war, Earnest said. But it is also a conflict, a campaign, a struggle, a fracas, and, if you will, a melee. The spokesman said that there was no contradiction between Kerrys position and the White Houses on the matter. Though Secretary Kerry said that there was no war and we said that there was a war, were all on the same page in saying that there will be hostilities, he said. Earnest added that, over the next few days, the White House will determine what to call the enemy: ISIS, ISIL, the Islamic State, or something else entirely. "
0,"Well, this is an absolutely massive presidential campaign shakeup. Despite a relatively strong showing so far in the Republican primary elections, Ted Cruz announced this morning that he has decided to suspend his campaign for president in order to tend to his thousands of glistening eggs. Calling all political pundits, because this changes everything. I believe that I could have served the American people admirably as president, but at the end of the day, my throbbing, glistening eggs come first, a visibly emotional Cruz said at a press conference in St. Louis this morning. I need to keep my eggs wet with Sprite soda, and thats incredibly time-consuming. I cannot in good conscience continue my bid for the presidency when I know that twice every hour I need to go into my garage, where my thousands of throbbing eggs shimmer in the dim headlights of the minivan I keep idling at all times, and I need to moisten them with Sprite soda from a spray bottle. My eggs have got to be wet with Sprite soda. Im sorry. Cruz held a brief Q&A session following his announcement, and when a crestfallen supporter asked the Texas senator why he couldnt get somebody else to care for his mountain of eggs until the election was over, Cruz responded firmly and pragmatically: I need to sing hymns to my eggs, I need to keep my eggs safe from cockroaches and other predators, I need to count my eggs, and I need to keep my eggs wet with Sprite soda. Most importantly, when the eggs hatch, I need to be there so that the hatchlings can devour my body. It has to be me. Thank you to all my supporters, and may God continue to bless this great country. Wow. It looks like the GOP candidate pool just got a little bit thinner! It will be interesting to see how the remaining presidential hopefuls handle the rest of their campaigns now that Ted Cruz has returned home to tend to his vast legions of glimmering eggs. This is just further proof that the 2016 presidential primary season is rewriting every rule in the book, and we cant wait to see what comes next. "

Arlington National Cemetery is taking to the road, and it just might be coming to your town! Residents from Dallas to Detroit will be able to visit the cemetery and pay their respects at hallowed landmarks including the USS Maine Memorial, JFKs eternal flame, and the graves of over 400,000 American servicemen.

0,"Two days after asserting that President Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, a guy who asked Donald Trump a provocative question at a New Hampshire rally is now the front-runner in the Republican race for President, according to a new poll. The poll, which was conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, shows Muslim Question Guy leading the G.O.P. field with thirty-four per cent as opposed to nineteen per cent for Trump. In interviews with poll respondents, Republicans gave Muslim Question Guy high marks for stating that President Obama was neither Christian nor American and criticized Trump for not being more vocal in his agreement on those points. Minutes after the poll was released, however, Trump was on the offensive, attacking Muslim Question Guy during an appearance on CNN. People who are supporting this guy havent done their homework, the businessman said. If you look back over the past seven years, no one has called Obama a foreign-born Muslim more often than I have. Trumps comments did little to slow the momentum of Muslim Question Guy, who drew four thousand people at his first official campaign rally in Concord, New Hampshire, where he vowed to take back the country from Muslim clockmakers.

0,"Moments after squeaking out a razor-thin victory in Super Tuesdays crucial Ohio primary, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was in an exuberant mood, telling supporters in Boston, I stand before you tonight as the man people hate slightly less than Rick Santorum. Mr. Romney said that he hoped to take the momentum of being marginally less despised than Mr. Santorum all the way to the Republican convention in Tampa. The voters of Ohio have said that they want the lesser of two evils, he told the crowd, and I am lesser. But in the Santorum camp, the former Pennsylvania senator showed no signs that he is ready to get out of the race: In states like Oklahoma and Tennessee, voters spoke loudly and clearly that they cant stand Mitt more than they detest me. Thats what I call a recipe for success. Meanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to stay in the race, noting that voters in his home state of Georgia hated both Messrs. Romney and Santorum more than they loathed him. This race isnt about winning or losing, he said. This is about me standing in front of a microphone and listening to the sound of my own voice for as long as possible. And former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin hinted that she might have a role to play if the G.O.P. contest becomes deadlocked: Remember, it was my historic lowering of the bar that made this Republican race possible.

Explaining the development of Facebooks new phone software, Home, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Our research showed that Facebook users still had a few hours a day when they were leading somewhat healthy and productive lives. Our new software will change all of that. Mr. Zuckerberg said his developers had worked for months developing Home, which seizes control of your phone and makes it good for little other than Facebookmuch like many Facebook users themselves. By bombarding the user with status updates on a twenty-four-hour basis, he boasted, Home transforms Facebook from just a social network into something akin to a neurological disorder. As the audience applauded that pronouncement, Mr. Zuckerberg added, At Facebook, we want to be a million voices inside your head. When one member of the audience worried whether Home would give Facebook even more access to private information about ones life, Mr. Zuckerberg reassured the questioner, After using Home for several weeks, you will have no life. While clearly proud of his latest product, Mr. Zuckerberg gave notice that he did not intend to rest on his laurels: At Facebook, we will never stop striving to replace real experience with something soulless and empty.

Justin, if you are watching right now, this is my message to you, Kim said. I stand ready and willing to be your B.F.F. The mercurial Kim said that he would seek Mr. Biebers aid in boosting North Koreas slumping pop-music industry, which has failed to generate any hits comparable to South Koreas Gangnam Style. Justin Bieber could be our Minister of Culture, he said. The dictator said he understood that Mr. Biebers fans were concerned about the direction the singer was heading of late, but he offered this reassurance: He is heading to North Korea. Its all good. "
0,"There is a deep-seated fear among some Americans that an Ebola outbreak could make the country turn to science. In interviews conducted across the nation, leading anti-science activists expressed their concern that the American people, wracked with anxiety over the possible spread of the virus, might desperately look to science to save the day. Its a very human reaction, said Harland Dorrinson, a prominent anti-science activist from Springfield, Missouri. If you put them under enough stress, perfectly rational people will panic and start believing in science. Additionally, he worries about a slippery slope situation, in which a belief in science leads to a belief in math, which in turn fosters a dangerous dependence on facts. At the end of the day, though, Dorrinson hopes that such a doomsday scenario will not come to pass. Time and time again through history, Americans have been exposed to science and refused to accept it, he said. I pray that this time will be no different. "
0,"The Republican National Committee has issued the following confidential memo to delegates attending its 2012 national convention: Welcome Republicans! By now, you should have received your credentials, your mask of Obama in Joker makeup, and the number to call if you see Sarah Palin anywhere on the premises. As a delegate to the 2012 Republican National Convention, the eyes of the world are upon you. More specifically, the eyes of the liberal-dominated media, who will be eager to exploit any signs of less than total enthusiasm for our nomineethat is, when theyre not trying to trick you into talking about rape. The point of this memo is not to convince you to like Mitt Romney. We know that ship sailed long, long ago. The point is to win in November and protect the American values that our forefathers fought so hard for, such as mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds. Here, then, is a list of helpful tips on how to pretend to like Mitt Romney: 1. In previous regional practice sessions, there has been a ten to fifteen second lag time between a speaker saying the name Mitt Romney and any audible applause or cheering on the part of session participants. To tighten up this silence hole, try to get in the habit of clapping/hooting/stomping whenever anyone says anything. 2. Heres a simple exercise you can do in your hotel room, car, or anywhere. Say the name Mitt Romney, then try to visualize something that you love: a family member, for example, or your favorite Fox host. 3. Starting Monday morning at the Tampa Marriott there will be intensive thirty-minute coaching seminars on fake smiling and squealing led by Flo, of Progressive insurance fame! There will be light refreshments and amphetamines. 4. Some of you have expressed concern that no matter how hard you try, even after listening to the Kid Rock Romney Rocks CD we provided, every time you hear the name Mitt Romney you cant help but frown and find yourselves on the edge of tears. To you, we say: Go for it! TV viewers are sure to misinterpret a delegates full-on sobbing as a sign of being overwhelmed by love for Mitt (LOL). To hone your weeping skills, weve included in your Convention Welcome Bag a DVD of Michael Phelpss mom, Debbie, at the London Olympics and footage of Kim Jong-ils funeral. 5. Close your eyes and think of Santorum. "

Its going to be on top of every bowl of soup. Talk about going above and beyond. Its clear that this soup kitchen knows what the holidays are all about. The homeless community in the Weehawken area are certainly in for a bowl of soup they wont soon forgetwe just wish we could try some! Faith in humanity restored! "
0,"Well, this could have been bad. According to White House sources and news outlets in Washington, D.C., a masked intruder just made his way past security, broke into the White House, and gave President Obama a free guitar lesson before finally being apprehended by the Secret Service. This was a really close call. It seems like this was a giant security failure all around. Not only was the anonymous intruder able to make his way inside the White House and into the Lincoln Bedroomhe was able to teach Obama several basic chords and the opening riff to Sunshine Of Your Love before the security breach was even detected! It seems like somebody needs to get fired. In the aftermath of the guitar lesson, during which the intruder taught the president the names of all the guitar strings as well as the C-major and A-minor scales, the Secret Service issued an apology and took full responsibility for the incident. However, a simple apology might not be enough. This timeline highlights some of the key moments of the presidents guitar lesson and illustrates just how catastrophic this security breach truly was: 7:32 a.m.: Anonymous, masked intruder scales White House fence and enters White House undetected through unlocked utility door, chiefly used by maintenance staff. 7:43 a.m.: Intruder gains access to the main hall of the White House through a service tunnel. 7:52 a.m.: Intruder locates President Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom, unattended by Secret Service. 8:00 a.m.: Intruder allows president to borrow a cheaply made nylon-string acoustic guitar. 8:06 a.m.: Intruder plays fast, impressive solo to show President Obama what hell be able to do if he works hard at the guitar and really sticks with it for a few years. 8:12 a.m.: Intruder tells president that the strings of the guitar are tuned to E, A, D, G, B, and E, and teaches him the acronym Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good-Bye Eddie to help him remember it. 8:16 a.m.: Intruder asks president if hes more interested in rock or jazz. 8:18 a.m.: Intruder teaches President Obama the E-major, A-major, and D-major chords. 8:25 a.m.: Intruder attempts to teach President Obama an F-major bar chord. 8:32 a.m.: Intruder reassures discouraged president that bar chords are challenging and that he can work on the F-major bar chord on his own after the lesson. 8:35 a.m.: Intruder teaches President Obama the opening riff to Creams Sunshine Of Your Love. President proceeds to play riff repeatedly for the next 10 minutes. 8:45 a.m.: Secret Service agents apprehend the intruder and usher the president to a secure location. For those of you keeping track, thats more than a full hour between the time that the intruder broke into the White House and when Secret Service interrupted the guitar lesson he was giving to the president. Yikes. Hopefully, the Secret Service is taking measures to prevent anyone else from getting inside the White House to teach the president how to play guitar. In the meantime, Obama should consider making some major personnel changes! "
0,"Just hours after an embarrassing launch of a rocket that crashed to the ground in a little over a minute, North Korea suffered another blow to its prestige as it was expelled from the Axis of Evil. The decision was announced by the presiding Chairman of the Axis of Evil, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who cited as the reason for the expulsion North Koreas evident lack of evil. There are a lot of evil countries out there, Iran for one, who are trying to terrify the world by developing nuclear weapons, he said. When North Korea launches a so-called rocket and it goes about twenty feet before blowing up, that just makes it harder for the rest of us. A spokesman for the erstwhile evil nation objected strongly to Mr. Ahmadinejads statement, saying it was totally unfair to judge how evil a country is based on one crappy rocket. For a rogue nation that prides itself on threatening the world community, membership in the Axis of Evil is considered essential, which makes North Koreas expulsion from the group a particularly damaging setback. The rocket thing is hurting our credibility, evil-wise, no question about it, one aide to North Korean President Kim Jong-un said today. This afternoon we tried to threaten Japan and it went straight to voice mail. In a possible sign of newly reduced ambitions, North Korea today hurled a roll of toilet paper over the border at South Korea. Mr. Ahmadinejad offered no comment about the latest incident on the Korean Peninsula, other than to say, Really, the whole thing is kind of sad. "
0,"In a dramatic departure from existing White House procedures, President Obama requested today that his staff start ccing him on stuff. Look, I know a lot of you think Im really busy and you dont want to bother me, the President reportedly told his staff in an Oval Office meeting. But cc me anyway. Its good for me to keep up on whats going on around here. Its not good when I turn on the news and theyre talking about something at the White House and Im like, whoa, when did that happen? Mr. Obama added. I think ccing me would go a long way toward fixing that. Maybe put a Post-It note on your computer saying, CC POTUS, so you dont forget, he said as the meeting broke up. Afterward, the President told aides that he felt really good about the meeting and was really looking forward to people looping me in on stuff. But Mr. Obamas mood soured later in the day, sources say, when his e-mail address was left off a message bearing the subject line, Things the Treasury Dept. Is Planning to Do. Mr. Obama hastily reconvened his staff, telling them, Look, maybe I didnt make myself clear. Thats just the kind of thing I should have been ccd on. Even Biden got that one. Could one of you please forward it to me? As of press time, Mr. Obama had not yet received the e-mail. "

After emerging from their offices to see the source of the commotion, the other Justices found a visibly agitated Justice Scalia, his face beet-red and his entire body shaking with rage.

0,"A new Mitt Romney is emerging in the closing days of the campaign, aides say: a man who is increasingly being eaten alive with jealousy by President Obamas budding relationship with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. While Mr. Romney has told reporters that he is totally fine with Gov. Christie flying around in a helicopter with President Obama, privately he has told aides, Seeing him with Chris Christie is tearing me apart. The trouble began earlier this week, a Romney aide said, when Mr. Romney saw Mr. Christie on CNN mention that President Obama had given him his number at the White House. Mitt was like, Fine, whatever, do we have to watch this? and then basically ran out of the room, the aide said. It was completely awkward. Making matters worse, the aide said, Chris Christie isnt returning his calls. Mitt was trying to explain his position on FEMA to reporters yesterday and he got all excited because his phone started vibrating, the aide said. It turned out it was just Ann. Mr. Romney, who has been seen doodling Chris Christies name in the margins of his briefing books in recent days, has apparently decided on a new course of action: to make the New Jersey governor jealous. Hes been calling [New York Governor Andrew] Cuomo, the aide said. But Cuomo wont call him back either. Its all so sad. "

If she didnt receive a transplant quickly, her chances of survival would be slim. Thats when something incredible happened: A total stranger wandered into an abandoned field and started sniffing around until he found her a kidney. Wow! Hows that for a real-life guardian angel? Its unclear how the stranger, who does not know Julie or any of her family members, learned of the fifth-graders desperate need for a kidney transplant, but its a good thing he did, because he immediately bounded into a field off of I-80 near Lincoln, NE and started sniffing around for a match. The good Samaritan spent a whole 45 minutes looking under rocks and sniffing around shrubs until he finally got a whiff of a kidney lying in the dirt near some stalks of wheat. Once he found it, he even went to the trouble of washing it off a little bit in a nearby stream! All this for a total stranger he knew absolutely nothing about other than the fact that she was a human in need. Inspiring! And of course, he was far too modest to take any credit for his good deed. After driving over 500 miles to drop off Julies new kidney at her hospital in Chicago, he headed on home before she was even able to thank him! Its the true mark of a humble hero who somehow heard that a stranger needed a new kidney and didnt hesitate to immediately start smelling around in the dirt for one. Inspiring. Faith in humanity restored! "

John McCain (R-Ariz) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) led the attack on Thursday, blasting Obama for failing to craft a stupid response to crises in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine. Instead of reacting to these events with the haste and recklessness they deserve, the President has chosen to waste valuable time thinking, McCain said. This goes against the most fundamental principles of American foreign policy. Graham also expressed frustration with the President, telling reporters, The American people are waiting for President Obama to do something stupid, but their patience is wearing thin. In his most withering criticism, McCain called Obamas stubborn refusal to do stupid stuff a failure of leadership. If I were President, you can bet your bottom dollar I would have done plenty of stupid stuff by now, he said. "
0,"In a blistering indictment of the Administrations economic policies, the chairman of the Republican National Committee has accused President Obama of forcing five million Americans back to work since he took office, in 2009. When President Obama took office, there were five million Americans at home all day who are now, sadly, not at home, said Reince Priebus, on Sundays edition of Meet the Press. They have to go to work five days a week and theyre mad as hell about it. He said that he expected G.O.P. candidates in the midterm elections to hammer away at the Presidents greatest vulnerability, which he called the ugly side of employment. You dont take five million Americans, uproot them from their families, and make them leave their homes for eight hours a day, Priebus said. This isnt a dictatorship. This is America. He added that the Presidents failure on this issue has helped sharpen the Republican Partys message to voters. If youre sick and tired of employment, vote for us, he said. "
0,"As the debate over Syria moves to the United States Congress, a leading Senate Republican said today that the only way to resolve the crisis in the war-torn Middle Eastern country is by defunding Obamacare at once. Appearing on the Fox News Channel, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told host Sean Hannity, If were trying to send a strong message to [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad, I can think of no better way to do that than by defunding Obamacare. Elaborating on his strategy, Sen. Cruz added, By defunding Obamacare, we would basically be saying to Assad, This is how we attack our own President, so just imagine what well do to you. That would make him think twice before he pulls another one of his stunts. You can fire off as many Tomahawk missiles as you want, said Sen. Cruz. But they wont have the same impact on Syria as defunding Obamacare. Shortly after his appearance, Sen. Cruzs statements drew a sharp rebuke from a fellow Republican, Arizona Senator John McCain, who called the prospect of bombing Syria the only thing I have to live for. Look, Ive been in a very dark place since the 2008 election, Sen. McCain told reporters. There have been a lot of mornings when, quite frankly, I havent had a reason to get out of bed. Its all well and good for people like Ted Cruz to criticize Tomahawk missiles, but hitting Syria is all thats keeping me going. "
0,"Its that time of year. Just when you think bitterness, brutality, and violence have won the day, Christmas is here to remind you that theres still a whole lot of good in the world. Last night, in the disputed Syrian city of Raqqa, the American troops and ISIS put aside their differences and came together to celebrate Christmas. According to reports, the inspiring festivities began shortly after sunset on Christmas Eve, when members of the American-led coalition against the Islamic State stationed on the streets suddenly heard something that astonished them: the resonant voices of ISIS fighters as they walked toward them, their arms interlocked, their weapons nowhere to be found, singing Silent Night. The insurgents outpouring of Christmas joy was so stirring that, ignoring orders from the Pentagon and their commanding officers, American troops soon added their voices to the swelling chorus, abandoning their posts and mingling with their sometime enemies around a pine tree that one jihadist had cut down and adorned with makeshift Christmas decorations! It was the same scene all across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq: Deep into the night and then into the morning, eyes shone with joyful tears as the fighters sang, fraternized, and even started games of pickup soccer with the very same young men and women who only hours before they would have publicly beheaded, hurled from a seven-story building, or shot with a sniper rifle from hundreds of yards away. If only for one day, the two sides were able to embrace, exchange modest gifts of food and cigarettes, and pray together in a solemn commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Wow. Its just more proof that even in the darkest corner of the world, even in a place where all hope seemed lost, even on the bleak battlefield of the interminable war in which these unfortunate people find themselves trappedeven there, its Christmastime. Merry Christmas to America. Merry Christmas to ISIS. And Merry Christmas to you and your family, no matter what side youre on! "
0,"The mystery surrounding Colonel Muammar Qaddafis whereabouts was resolved today as the dictator announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination in a town-hall meeting in Concord, New Hampshire. In announcing his candidacy, the Libyan madman joins a Republican field which is believed to number in excess of seven hundred candidates. While some New Hampshire Republicans seemed surprised to see Colonel Qaddafi shaking hands and kissing babies at the Concord town hall, an aide to the Libyan strongman said his transformation to G.O.P. candidate made perfect sense. In those final days in Tripoli he was becoming increasingly disconnected from reality, said the aide. So I think hell fit right in. Mr. Qaddafi, dressed in his trademark yellow turban and matching robe, got mixed reviews in his first appearance on the campaign trail, with some New Hampshire citizens saying that his six-hour stump speech was badly in need of pruning. Additionally, some felt that his rhetoric needed to be toned down, especially his closing line about fighting for the Republican nomination until the last drop of blood. But others gave him high marks for his grasp of history and geography, which most agreed was stronger than Michele Bachmanns. Perhaps underscoring the challenges that lie ahead for Mr. Qaddafi in his quest for the G.O.P. nod, current polls show him in the back of the pack, leading former Senator Rick Santorum but trailing the pizza guy. Unfortunately for Muammar Qaddafi, he might be out of step with the current crop of Republican candidates, one pollster said. Theres a perception that hes too moderate. "
0,"The Mitt Romney Gaffe Express pulled into a new station today, leaving its conductors hopes of proving himself to be a nimble statesman in tatters. Mr. Romneys troubles began in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to whom he presented gifts of a HoneyBaked ham and a wheel of cheddar cheese. After Mr. Netanyahu ordered both gifts removed from his residence and destroyed, Mr. Romney went on to address the Knesset, where he congratulated the Jewish people on building the pyramids. Ann and I saw them during a cruise we took to the Middle East, and they were magnificent, he told the stunned legislators. As accomplishments go, building the pyramids isnt up there with saving the Olympics, but you should still feel very, very proud. Nice job. Sensing that his remarks were not going over as well as intended, Mr. Romney improvised: No, really. Incredible building job you did. If any of you would like to work on our house in La Jolla, just say the word. Only thing is, youll have to work Saturdays. Mr. Romneys day concluded with an awkward moment at the West Bank, where he attempted to deposit ten million dollars. "
0,"The San Diego Convention Center is hosting the first-ever convention of people who shot Osama bin Laden, with organizers expecting a turnout of between three thousand and four thousand. According to organizers, the agenda of the convention is to help people who killed bin Laden market their story for books, movies, YouTube videos, and other media platforms. Tracy Klugian, who came up with the idea of the convention shortly after he killed bin Laden, in 2011, said that he hoped the weekend-long gathering would help participants to take their experience of shooting Osama bin Laden to the next level. At the end of the day, this weekend is all about storytelling, Klugian said. Ive met hundreds of guys who have great stories about the night they shot bin Laden, but theyre still a few workshops away from turning it into a decent TED talk. He scoffed at the suggestion that the marketplace was saturated with people who shot the Al Qaeda leader, making it more difficult to monetize that fateful night in Abbottabad. Thats like saying there can only be one Hunger Games movie, he said. Trust me, killing bin Laden is a very powerful brand. "
0," Responding to the firestorm of controversy over its spying on European allies, the head of the National Security Agency said today it would do everything in its power to avoid being caught doing it in the future. There are two important jobs for every spy agency: spying on people and avoiding detection, said the N.S.A. chief General Keith Alexander. Unfortunately, at the N.S.A. we have only done the first job well. We have abused the trust of some of our closest allies, he said. And none of this would have happened if they hadnt found out. General Alexander said that the agency was instituting strict new practices that amounted to a zero-tolerance policy on getting caught. I had a meeting with my top people today and said, I want you to put the same energy you put into spying on Germany, France, and Spain into keeping them from figuring out what were up to, he said. Anything less than that will be unacceptable. General Alexander also offered a heartfelt apology to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a prime target of the agencys eavesdropping. I know how upsetting it must be for you to know that your closest ally has been listening in on your phone conversations for the past eleven years, he said. I give you my solemn promise that in the future you wont know. "
0," A new poll shows that Americans who were unconcerned about climate change as it wreaked havoc around the world are beginning to worry, now that global warming is affecting the appearance of their lawns. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, rising sea levels, the destruction of habitats, and catastrophic weather conditions, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, have not served as the wake-up call to Americans that their lawns unsightly barrenness has. In interviews across the state of California, residents expressed anger and outrage that climate change had been allowed to worsen to the point that it has now severely limited their choice of ground cover, shrubs, and other decorative plantings. We are being forced to create a front lawn out of stones and, yes, cacti, said Harland Dorrinson, a resident of suburban Sacramento. Im not sure that this is a world I would want to leave to my children. Right now were looking at a situation where we have to choose between saving our climbing hydrangeas or our roses, said Tracy Klugian, of San Diego. We are no longer living like humans. Carol Foyler, a San Mateo resident who has watched her lawn turn from a gorgeous green to a hideous brown during Californias drought, said she blamed scientists for failing to warn us of the true cost of climate change. They always said that polar bears would starve to death, she said. But they never told us our lawns would look like crap. "
0,"The following message was released today by the National Alliance of Funeral Directors: This week, several Republican Supreme Court Justices have argued that the Affordable Care Act supported by the Obama Administration is unconstitutional. At the National Alliance of Funeral Directors, we couldnt agree more. It was Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry who said, in 1775, Give me liberty or give me death. From that moment on, legal scholars have agreed that the Constitution guarantees every American the liberty to be dead. Here at the Alliance, we will fight for your right to be dead to the death. Lets take a look, if you will, at the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which protects every Americans right to shoot another American. It says nothing about giving the person who is shot health insurance to prevent him from dying. This cherished constitutional right to shoot people and make them dead is currently recognized in all fifty states, most recently Florida. In commenting on the Affordable Care Act this week, Justice Samuel Alito compared the Obama health-care plan to burial insurance. Coincidentally, burial insurance is the Republican health-care plan, and one that we enthusiastically support. Under this plan, every American would be mandated to buy a coffin from one of our member-owned and -operated funeral homes. May we recommend the Peaceful Valley Royale, a luxury mahogany casket with sienna satin interior and the finest imitation antique nickel handles ($2,899). As the organization representing Americas funeral directors, gravediggers, embalmers and cremators, we are confident that the Supreme Court will ultimately do the right thing and decide that health care flies in the face of every Americans constitutional right to the pursuit of deadness. And when they do, well be waiting for you. Sincerely, The National Alliance of Funeral Directors "
0,"A majority of Oregonians favor building a twenty-foot wall along the border of their state to prevent angry white men from getting in, a poll released on Monday shows. The survey indicates that Oregonians are fed up with irate male Caucasians pouring into their state and bringing with them guns, violence, and terrorism. This used to be such a nice state, said Oregon State Senator Carol Foyler, a pro-wall lawmaker. Since the angry white men came here, parts of it are unrecognizable. But even as support for the Oregon wall grows, critics of the proposal say that it does nothing to address the fact that there are already thousands of angry white men living in the state. Those critics favor forcibly removing the angry white men through mass deportations and resettling them elsewhere, possibly in Texas. While some argue that the deportation of angry white men would separate them from their families, others believe that their families would be O.K. with seeing them go.

According to a statement released this morning, the role of Walt Whitman is going to none other than Channing Tatum, and the 19th-century American poet could not be in better hands. Tatum confirmed the news himself earlier today on Twitter: Yes. Just yes. Its no secret that Tatum has been coming into his own lately, and playing the famed father of free verse is the perfect way to prove that he can still carry a big-budget franchise. According to his agent, Tatum has been getting into character by watching every Bond movie and reading Leaves Of Grass. Plus, hes been working with a dialect coach to nail down his accent, as well as transforming himself physically, gaining 65 pounds and growing out Whitmans trademark shaggy beard. Fans arent the only ones excited about Channings new role. Future co-star Daniel Craig seemed equally thrilled with the announcement. Ive always been a big Channing fan, and its an honor to have him join the Bond family, said Craig in a statement. I, for one, think hes going to be an incredible Walt. Well, you heard it here first!

0,"In a sign of voters shifting perspectives about Presidential hopefuls, a new survey reveals that Americans are deeply nostalgic for a Republican candidate who only wanted to screw over forty-seven per cent of them. In interviews conducted across the country, voters expressed wistfulness and even a deep longing for a man who was indifferent to the fates of nearly half the nations residents. When he was running, it seemed like a bad thing that he didnt care whether forty-seven per cent of the country lived or died, said Tracy Klugian, of Akron, Ohio. Now I realize we were being too picky. He threw thousands of people out of their jobs and onto the streets, but he let them stay in the country, said Kent Bantwell, of Springfield, Missouri. Ive got to say, I miss him. Harland Dorrinson, of Jupiter, Florida, said that he wished that the man would jump into the 2016 race, but admitted that was unlikely. That secret tape where he said he was screwing over forty-seven per cent of the country would be brought up again, he said. The fact that he wasnt screwing over a bigger number would come back to haunt him now. Carol Foyler, of San Dimas, California, said she wished she could take back all the nasty things she said about the man when he ran for President in 2012. I called him a jerk and a tool and a sociopathand worse, she remembered, shaking her head. Now he seems like Mandela. Watch: Two AM New York newspaper venders make a terrible discovery. "
0," In a troubling sign for the 114th Congress, a new poll released on Tuesday indicates that the day-old legislative body is the most hated in the nations history. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, only eight per cent of those surveyed approved of the job Congress is doing, a scathing indictment of the legislators first day on the job. The 114th Congress started the day on a slightly more positive note, garnering a ten-per-cent approval rating, but after the House of Representatives relected John Boehner (R.-Ohio) to a new term as Speaker, the number sank to eight. On the Senate side, Joni Ernst (R.-Iowa), newly elected to the most despised Congress in American history, said that the low approval number was no cause for concern. If you ask somebody to pick a number between one and ten, eight is a pretty high number, she said. So its all good. After Senator Ernst made her comment, Congresss approval rating plummeted to four per cent. "
0,"In an escalation of the stalemate gripping Washington, House Republicans voted today to shut down the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls reasoning and impulses. The resolution, which passed with heavy Tea Party support, calls for a partial shutdown of the brain, leaving the medulla and cerebellum, sometimes referred to as the reptilian brain, up and running. The Tea Party caucus cheered the passage of the bill, which was sponsored by Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who called the measure long overdue. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) offered no timetable for restarting the prefrontal cortex, telling reporters, It will most certainly remain shut down during any negotiations with the President. Thats the only leverage we have. Representative Bachmann agreed: The President can go ahead and put a gun to our heads. Theres nothing there. While the G.O.P.s decision to shut down the prefrontal cortex rattled Wall Street, the neuroscientist Davis Logsdon said it should be seen as little more than a symbolic vote, noting, Its actually been shut down since the 2008 election.

This man is in fact the least interesting person in America, one Guinness official said, adding that Mr. Romney himself had held that title since 1947.

0,"Washington was in turmoil on Tuesday morning as a House select committee abruptly cancelled its Benghazi hearings shortly after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she was withdrawing from the Presidential race. Secretary Clintons stunning announcement came at 9:00 A.M., followed by the committee chairman Trey Gowdys decision to cancel the hearings at 9:04. As you know, we have been preparing for this weeks hearings for months, Gowdy said. However, after meeting with fellow committee members over the past four minutes, weve come to the conclusion that we know all we need to know about Benghazi. Gowdy flatly denied that the decision to cancel the long-awaited Benghazi hearings had anything to do with Clintons sudden departure from the race. We wish her well in whatever her future endeavors may be, he said. But shortly after Gowdys announcement, Clinton called an impromptu press conference at 9:13 to announce that she was jumping back into the race. I was just trying to prove a point, she told reporters, before heading off to campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire. Minutes after Clintons second announcement, an irate Gowdy called her decision to reenter the race beyond unethical and revealed that the committees investigators had just uncovered fresh evidence about Benghazi.

What a wonderful tribute! We wanted to make sure the boy who had what was previously called autism is always remembered, so we changed the name of the condition from autism to boys autism, said Dr. Steven J. Stack, the president of the American Medical Association. The American Medical Association believes that this new tribute to the boy will serve as a fitting memorial to his legacy. Going forward, we remain committed to understanding the mysteries of boys autism, he added. Wow. Such an incredible way to honor the boy! The boy was diagnosed with the condition a long time ago and had boys autism for his entire life. Despite the hardships that he experienced as a result of his boys autism, the boy never got discouraged, and he worked hard to live a full and satisfying existence. It is because of the boys refusal to give up in the face of boys autism that the American Medical Association chose to name the condition in his honor. This is truly a pivotal milestone in the history of boys autism, said Joanna Whisenhunt, chairwoman of the National Boys Autism Foundation, which seeks to understand the causes and consequences of boys autism. One in every 68 children is diagnosed with boys autism. Now, every time we talk about boys autism, we can remember the boy who had boys autism and take inspiration from his perseverance in the face of adversity. Chances are good that you know someone with boys autism, a condition that affects millions of people in the United States alone. So, on this historic day for boys autism, be sure to share your gratitude to the American Medical Association in the comments! "
0,"In an impressive white-knuckle performance on live television today, members of Congress spent several hours in a hearing room pretending to understand the Internet. Beginning this morning, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee devoted four hours to grilling Web-site contractors about site architecture, Web traffic, software, and other I.T. concepts about which their ignorance is nearly complete. As members of this committee, we are supposed to have a deep understanding of the technology involved in the health-care Web site, said Chairman Fred Upton (R-Michigan). So it was absolutely imperative for us to fake that we do. For the duration of the hearings, the Web contractors offered detailed testimony about end-to-end testing, enterprise identity management, and other technical concepts to a group of elected officials who can barely use e-mail. I would say that, to a man, we did not understand ninety-nine per cent of that computer nonsense they were going on about, Chairman Upton said. To me it was a whole lot of blahbitty-blahbitty-blah. I hope it wasnt too obvious. Rep. Upton said that looking serious and nodding our heads a lot contributed to the illusion that committee members had even scant comprehension of what was being discussed. At the end of the day, a lot of it came down to not asking the questions you really wanted to ask, he said. Like, What exactly is a Web site? "
0,"Its no secret that the Boy Scouts of America have a long history of discrimination. Until 2014, the organization refused to grant openly gay children membership into the Scouts, and until July of this year, gay Scout leaders were forbidden as well. But now, the organization is taking some commendable steps to atone for past wrongdoing. First and foremost, theyre posthumously awarding an Oceanography badge to Freddie Mercury, the gay frontman of legendary rock band Queen. Boys Scouts of America chief scout executive Michael B. Surbaugh announced the honor in a press release earlier this week, stating that while the badge cannot erase the pain caused by the organizations longstanding policies of intolerance, the gesture can hopefully be seen as a commitment to future inclusiveness. Though we do not have any direct knowledge that Mr. Mercury was ever denied the opportunity to join the Scouts because of his sexual orientation, we nonetheless believe that he deserves to be celebrated as someone who exemplifies the qualities of self-confidence and leadership that are the cornerstones of our programs, the statement read. The Oceanography badge not only represents ones knowledge and stewardship of our aquatic habitats, but also ones potential to advance to higher ranks as a Scout. Had Mr. Mercury dedicated himself to the Scouting principles of personal growth and citizenship, we have no doubt he could have achieved the rank of Star, Life, or even Eagle Scout. Wow. For those who might dismiss this as an empty token gesture, it should be noted that the Oceanography badge isnt handed out to just anyone. Typically, a scout is required to make his own functioning plankton net, describe the key biological properties of seawater, demonstrate comprehension for how tides work, and write a 500-word book report before he can even be considered for the award. So, while it may not be as big as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, its certainly no small honor. The Boy Scouts of America still have a long way to go before they can be absolved for their history of intolerance, but this is definitely a good start! "

0,"In its historic first democratic election, Egypt has followed the lead of the United States in electing a Muslim President, the Fox News Channel reported today. Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, noted that, in electing Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptians were echoing the decision of American voters in 2008. The similarities between Obama and Morsi are striking, he said. Both come from radical political parties, and both have unfamiliar, foreign-sounding names. One key difference, of course, is that Morsi makes no secret of being a Muslim. Mr. Hannity predicted that the two Presidents could have a close working relationship going forward: Im sure President Obama has already called Morsi to congratulate him, one Muslim brother to another. Mr. Hannity said that the election of Mr. Morsi may be just the latest result in a trend that augurs well for Mr. Obamas own relection hopes: In recent months, Egypt elected a Muslim, France elected a Socialist, and Kenya elected a Kenyan. In other Egyptian news, a hospital spokesman said today that former President Hosni Mubarak, declared clinically dead just days ago, continues to make a remarkable recovery: Today he was able to eat, say a few words, and wire four billion dollars to Switzerland.

The city of Cleveland has taken some hard knocks over the years, James said. But here you are today, receiving the most magnificent prize the world has to offer. Choking up, James added, Im so happy for you. In contrast with his first public appearance in Miami four years ago, James did not promise Cleveland a series of N.B.A. titles.

Appearing with House Speaker John Boehner, McConnell said that, in contrast to President Obamas Band-Aid fixes, the Republican plan would address the root cause of immigration, which is that the United States is, for the most part, habitable. For years, immigrants have looked to America as a place where their standard of living was bound to improve, McConnell said. Were going to change that. Boehner said that the Republicans plan would reduce or eliminate immigration magnets, such as the social safety net, public education, clean air, and drinkable water. The Speaker added that the plan would also include the repeal of Obamacare, calling healthcare catnip for immigrants. Attempting, perhaps, to tamp down excitement about the plan, McConnell warned that turning America into a dystopian hellhole that repels immigrants wont happen overnight. Our crumbling infrastructure and soaring gun violence are a good start, but much work still needs to be done, he said. When Americans start leaving the country, well know that were on the right track. In closing, the two congressional leaders expressed pride in the immigration plan, noting that Republicans had been working to make it possible for the past thirty years. "

Starting yesterday, the Romney campaign began reallocating lies originally intended for Virginia to other swing states such as Ohio and Wisconsin, the campaign confirmed today. An emergency situation like this really tests how good your ground game is, said campaign manager Matt Rhoades. Fortunately, we have liars in all fifty states. But even as the Romney campaign expressed outward confidence about its ability to maintain an uninterrupted flow of whoppers, some Republicans privately feared that a major power outage could disrupt its ability to lie, distort, and exaggerate in the crucial days ahead. If Fox News gets knocked off the air in some of these states, were certainly going to be down a quart in terms of falsehoods, one insider said. But according to Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who has been central to the campaigns lying efforts, the severe weather is a challenge that separates the men from the boys. Theyre expecting winds of up to seventy miles per hour, he told reporters. Fortunately, I can run eighty miles per hour. In Indiana, Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock weighed in on the approaching storm: It says a lot about God that while hes so busy impregnating women he still somehow finds the time to make a hurricane.

0,"Just minutes after the Supreme Court upheld President Obamas Affordable Care Act, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney slammed the Court, calling the law the worst idea I ever had. I vow to repeal this law on my first day in office, he told a crowd at a campaign rally. Until then, I will work tirelessly to make people forget that I used to totally love it. At the White House, President Obama greeted the news of the Courts decision in muted fashion: I havent been this pumped since I smoked bin Laden. Dissenters in the 5-4 decision included Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote, The only medical procedures the government should pay for are forced transvaginal ultrasounds and exorcisms. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also had harsh words for the health-care law, telling reporters, Under Obamacare, you will be forced to marry a gay doctor. But perhaps the most negative appraisal came from Speaker of the House John Boehner: This is a dark day for America. If we are forced to have health care, its only a matter of time before we have education. "
0,"In a stunning announcement on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said that he was dropping out of the Presidential race to focus his energies on tormenting Florida Senator Marco Rubio full-time. At the end of the day, running for President was interfering with what I really love, which is making Marco Rubios life a living hell, he said. Now I can get up every morning and spend all day just doing that. Christie said that he had tired of fielding questions about ISIS, immigration, and the economy and having to find some contrived way of answering them with a scathing attack on Rubio. Dont get me wrong, I was great at it, he said. But itll be so much easier to just get out there and start tearing him apart with no pretext whatsoever. The New Jersey governor, who plans to bring his message of character assassination to all fifty states, did not indicate how he would finance this mission. Ill pay for it myself if I have to, he said. If, looking back on my life, I can say that I ground Marco Rubio into the dirt, I will die a happy man. Asked what his first stop would be after leaving the campaign trail, Christie said, I want to reconnect with my family, hug my kids, and tell them what a douche Marco is.

0,"Many Americans are tired of explaining things to idiots, particularly when the things in question are so painfully obvious, a new poll indicates. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, while millions have been vexed for some time by their failure to explain incredibly basic information to dolts, that frustration has now reached a breaking point. Of the many obvious things that people are sick and tired of trying to get through the skulls of stupid people, the fact that climate change will cause catastrophic habitat destruction and devastating extinctions tops the list, with a majority saying that they will no longer bother trying to explain this to cretins. Coming in a close second, statistical proof that gun control has reduced gun deaths in countries around the world is something that a significant number of those polled have given up attempting to break down for morons. Finally, a majority said that trying to make idiots understand why a flag that symbolizes bigotry and hatred has no business flying over a state capitol only makes the person attempting to explain this want to put his or her fist through a wall. In a result that suggests a dismal future for the practice of explaining things to idiots, an overwhelming number of those polled said that they were considering abandoning such attempts altogether, with a broad majority agreeing with the statement, This country is exhausting.

0,"After several days of controversy over whether he would have authorized an invasion of Iraq, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said on Thursday that the question was unimportant since it is now painfully clear that he will never be President. Look, I can understand people wanting to know where I stand on this Iraq business if I actually had a chance of being elected, he told an audience in Arizona. But since Ive pretty much pissed that away, whats the point, really? Bush urged those who sought out his opinion on policy matters to take a look at how poorly his campaign is going and get a reality check about the odds of me ever being President, which are hovering in the vicinity of zero. Im tied with Ben Carson in the polls, folks, he said. You heard me. Ben-freaking-Carson. A neurosurgeon. If youre running in a Republican primary and cant beat a scientist, you might as well put a fork in it. When asked by a reporter what he would do to grow the economy, Bush laughed ruefully and said, Well, I guess if I said that Id do exactly what my brother did and drive the whole thing straight into the crapper, you folks would have a field day with that, wouldnt you? But lets get serious. You want an answer to that question, ask someone who actually has a chance at winning this damn thing. Im sure Scott Walker would love to talk to you good people. "
0,"A growing chorus of Republican lawmakers are demanding that President Obama take some action in Syria so that they can attack whatever action he took in Syria. Appearing on CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) laid out the situation in stark terms: The time for President Obama to do something in Syria that we can eviscerate him for is long overdue. Arguing that there are a variety of options available to Mr. Obama for dealing with Syria, Sen. Graham said, The President needs to choose one of those options so that we can immediately identify it as a catastrophic choice and demand that he be impeached. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) used an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press to express impatience with Mr. Obamas steadfast refusal to give us something new to rake him over the coals for. The American people have grown weary of my nonstop criticism of the Presidents handling of Libya, he said. They are ready to hear me incessantly berate him for his handling of a different country. At the end of his television appearance, Sen. McCain seemed to draw a line in the sand, making a direct challenge to Mr. Obama: Mr. President, we are sick and tired of attacking you for your inaction. The time has come for us to attack you for your action. "

For years, hed been trying to figure out the origin of a bizarre family photograph, and he hoped that the digital detectives at Reddit could help him out. It didnt take long for Reddit to get on the case, and soon, thousands of users were chipping in to help unravel this riddle.

0,"Congressional seats are on pace to fetch a whopping four billion dollars on Tuesday night, a record-smashing sales figure that has exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic insiders. The seats, which include four hundred and thirty-five in the House of Representatives and thirty-six in the Senate, have attracted buyers from a broad spectrum of industries, including investment banking, energy, pharmaceutical, and gun. With all of the uncertainty in the world today, the United States Congress is considered a very safe place for the rich to invest their money, said Charles Michollot, of the auction house Sothebys. Congressional seats are like Manhattan real estatethey arent making any more of them. But Anton Pickardin, of the rival auction house Christies, sounds more skeptical. I hate to be a wet blanket, but these sales figures lack rhyme and reason, Pickardin said. When someone is willing to pay millions of dollars for a pre-owned Mitch McConnell, you know that people have lost their minds. But Sothebys Michollot remains confident that, even at these hefty prices, congressional seats are a wise investment. When these seats go up for sale again, in 2016, four billion dollars is going to look like a bargain, he said. "

If the merger goes through, the polar bears and grizzly bears would together be able to terrorize a much larger landmass than ever before, experts said. Speaking at a packed press conference in New York accompanied by their investment bankers from Goldman Sachs, the jubilant bears gave their spin on the unprecedented deal. To say that were excited would be an understatement, said a spokesman for the grizzlies. For years, weve admired the way polar bears have dismembered hikers whove encroached on their territory. To be on the same team with talent like thatwhoa. Its a dream come true. While critics of the merger have argued that it is anticompetitive, a spokesman for the polar bears disagreed. I think working with the grizzlies is just going to push us to savage more human flesh than ever before. Speaking for myself, Im ready to start mauling, he said, underscoring his point by eating a reporter. The merger is not expected to face regulatory hurdles. "

0,"In an eleventh-hour development that could have an unpredictable effect on the vote to determine Scottish independence, Queen Elizabeth II took to the British airwaves on Thursday to excoriate the Scots in a one-hour, profanity-laden tirade. The Queens speech began with the phrase Listen, you Scottish bastards, and became steadily saltier as the monarch blasted her subjects for having the impudence to consider leaving the fold. Ill make you heel like a litter of [Anglo-Saxon vulgarity] corgis, she said, as her rage reached a crescendo. After the speech, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a desperate attempt at damage control, hoping to distance himself from the Queens paint-peeling rant. The views of Her Majesty the Queen are her own, he said in a hastily prepared statement. Neither I nor my government consider the people of Scotland bloody wankers. "
0,"Millions of Americans are expressing their resentment and outrage at being put in the appalling position of siding with the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, a state of affairs that many are calling intolerable. Never in a million years did I envision a situation where I would be on the same side as Megyn Kelly, Tracy Klugian, of Butte, Montana, said. Now that I find myself in just such a situation, let me say this: its horrible. Truly horrible. Putting people through the ordeal of siding with Megyn Kelly could be the worst thing Donald Trump has done in this campaign, Jervis Kentwell, of Norwalk, Connecticut, said. I know he thinks hes invulnerable or whatever, but its hard to see him recovering from this. Harland Dorrinson, a psychologist from Akron, Ohio, has created an online community for people who are suffering from the emotional trauma of momentarily siding with Megyn Kelly. People who have despised Megyn Kelly for years are experiencing a sudden loss of identity and a feeling of emptiness, he said. Theyre complaining of persistent headaches and nausea. There is a lot of hurt out there. Carol Foyler, of Tacoma, Washington, worries about the long-term implications of being forced to side with Megyn Kelly. Is there some scenario where I might be forced to side with Bill OReilly, or Hannity? she asked. Its a goddam slippery slope. Watch: New dance-floor options for the least smooth among us. "

But his supervisors at the USPS branch in Evanston, IL wanted to do something special for the loyal letter carrier, so they pulled out all the stops and arranged for Morris to spend his final day on the job delivering mail to Benicio Del Toro. Amazing. What a perfect sendoff for one devoted delivery man! I never dreamed of being given such an opportunity, Morris said. To be honored in this way, it was an overwhelming surprise. Morris didnt have long to be surprisedmere hours after arriving at work, he was standing in L.A.s Laurel Canyon neighborhood, his sack full of mail for Benicio Del Toro and the other residents of Del Toros neighborhood. Morris delivered nine envelopes and one large, heavy box to the Del Toro household. The Traffic star was reportedly not home, but that was fine by Morris. Im glad I didnt meet Benicio, Morris explained. I didnt want to meet him. This was a perfect day. Just 90 minutes after landing at LAX, Morris was on a plane again back to Illinois to complete his normal route and clock out one last time. Whats next for Morris? Spending more time with his grandkids and dusting off his tennis racket, according to the longtime public servant. One thing is for sure, though: He wont forget his day delivering Benicio Del Toros mail for a long, long time. We salute you, Morris! "
0,"Sixty-four unskilled workers will report to new jobs in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday as part of a federal jobs program that provides employment for people unable to find productive work elsewhere. The new hires, who have no talents or abilities that would make them employable in most workplaces, will be earning a first-year salary of $174,000. For that sum, the new employees will be expected to work a hundred and thirty-seven days a year, leaving them with two hundred and twenty-eight days of vacation. Some critics have blasted the federal jobs program as too expensive, noting that the workers were chosen last November in a bloated and wasteful selection process that cost the nation nearly four billion dollars. But Davis Logsdon, a University of Minnesota economics professor who specializes in labor issues, said that the program is necessary to provide work for people who honestly cannot find employment anywhere else. Expensive as this program is, it is much better to have these people in jobs than out on the street, he said. "
0,"By a 54 vote on Monday, the United States Supreme Court settled a dispute that Justice Samuel Alito said was at its core about the rights of women versus the rights of people. Writing for the majority, Justice Alito wrote, It is the duty of this Court, whenever it sees that the rights of people are being threatened, to do our best to safeguard those rights. In this case, it is clear that peoples rights were being threatened by women. Acknowledging that some women might argue that they, too, have some claim to being people, Justice Alito wrote, That is an interesting question for another day. While the Courts decision caused an uproar across the country, it received a big thumbs-up from one of the Justices who voted with the majority, Antonin Scalia. This has been a crappy year or so around here, what with all that gay-marriage stuff, but at least we finished strong, he said. "
0," In what legal experts are calling a landmark decision, on Monday the United States Supreme Court struck down what many believe to be the main reason the country was started. By a five-to-four vote, the Court eliminated what grade-school children have traditionally been taught was one of the key rationales for founding the United States in the first place. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy for over two hundred years, said Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority. Getting rid of it was long overdue. Calling the decision historic, Justice Antonin Scalia was guarded in predicting what the Court might accomplish next. Last year, we gutted the Voting Rights Act, and today we did the First Amendment, he said. Well just have to see whats left. "
0,"These days, parents are busier than ever, so its somewhat understandable when they rely on television to keep their kids occupied. Whether its gritty period dramas like Boardwalk Empire or cultural phenomena like Game Of Thrones, children of today are watching more top-notch programming than any previous generation. Its fine, up to a point, but the question bears asking: Are children watching too much of this golden age of TV? Because as tempting as it is to plop the kids down in the living room with a gorgeously produced series thats as thoughtful as it is gripping, we must not abdicate our responsibility as parents. Too many hours of stellar television a day will turn our kids into passive, sedate sponges, uncritically absorbing a litany of arresting performances from Edie Falco, Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston, Robin Wright, Taylor Schilling (arguably), Martin Freemanthe list goes on and on. Via CBS, HBO,FX, AMC Binge-watching triumphs of modern television like Sherlock and The Americans can stunt a childs mental development, said Anna Gerhardt, a child psychologist at the University of Wisconsin. The reality of the situation is all the bleaker when you realize kids stand no chance of keeping up with the hours of cant-miss television events that are released each week. Our children should be out exploring the world, but instead, they are glued to their screens, reveling in the ascendance of comedies like Broad City, Louie, and Archer that are showing whats possible for comedian-auteurs with a real budget. Turning the TV off isnt enough, either. Kids are watching great shows on their phones, on iPadsit seems that everywhere our kids turn, they encounter what can only be described as an artistic renaissance in popular filmmaking: stories of unprecedented scope and ambition in a format no longer beholden to the restrictions of classically episodic television.

0,"After watching its Vice-Presidential pick on the campaign trail over the weekend, the Romney campaign today issued the following confidential memo to Representative Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.): From: Romney for President Campaign To: Paul Ryan Subject: Tweaks We want to stress just how excited we are to have you as a member of Americas Comeback Team. The following suggestions are intended to make a super performance even superer: 1. On your first stop on Saturday, you said, Im opposed to Obamacare and Medicare, and also the word care. Even though that was a big applause line, were concerned that the MSM may take it out of context. 2. Some of your proposals, while bold and terrific, may need to be focus-grouped before you go public with them. Were thinking in particular of your town hall meeting on Sunday, when you proposed replacing Medicaid with Groupons. Also, we may want to dial back comments about putting the elderly on ice floes and letting them drift out to sea. Whenever an audience member at a campaign event needs a defibrillator that makes for bad optics. 3. Good people to quote in speeches: Ronald Reagan, Grover Norquist, Milton Friedman. Names to avoid: Ayn Rand, Marie Antoinette. 4. Just a suggestion/thought, but maybe come up with alternative ending for stump speech, other than Were Americas Comeback Team, and were going to make America come back to the year 1860. Other than those tweaks, just keep doing what youre doing. Dont know if youve noticed, but nobodys talking about Mitts tax returns anymore! LOL "

I know Im going to catch hell for saying this, but it looks kind of dumb, he said. Besides, you expect me to believe God really cares if I wear a big pointy hat or not? Come on. The Pontiff said that he would probably try out some different looks, like a baseball cap or something over the next few weeks, just to see what happens. If a lightning bolt comes out of the sky and cracks St. Peters in two, then I guess well know it was a bad idea, he chuckled. "
0,"When it comes to true allies, its hard to find better friends to the LGBTQ community than Mitch and Lauren Hendrick. A lot of people say they support gay rights, but this couple went above and beyond by conceiving and raising a gay son. Thats right. Mitch and Laurens son, Daniel, is 16 years old and is sexually attracted to men. It would have been easy for the Hendricks to simply put a rainbow flag up in their window or change their Facebook profile pictures, but the couple instead took the time and effort to give birth to a son who is actually gay. Wow! Truly inspiring. Admittedly, the Hendricks still have a little ways to go before they become perfect allies. They have a straight daughter, and neither Mitch nor Lauren are themselves gay, but when you consider how much the average person actually does to help the LGBTQ movement, you have to admit that the Hendricks are really doing something remarkable. Of course, we cant expect everyone to go the same distance as the Hendricks have, but if the couple inspires even a few people to show their support for the gay community by having some gay children, our world will definitely be a better place. Looks like love wins again! "
0,"Embattled radio host Rush Limbaugh suffered another major desertion today as he lost the support of one of his longtime sponsors, Satan. The usually reclusive Prince of Darkness announced his decision at a hastily called press conference in Columbus, Ohio, his unofficial headquarters on Earth. Due to remarks of his that we consider unacceptable, we are terminating our relationship with Rush Limbaugh, Satan said in a tersely worded statement. According to one advisor to the Lord of Misrule, Satan had stuck by the radio host as long as possible, but after he called a young woman a slut on the air Mr. Limbaugh had become radioactive. After a certain point, the association with Rush became problematic for Satans public image, the aide said. We went through a similar thing last year with Rupert Murdoch. Advertisers continued abandoning Mr. Limbaughs program in droves today, including companies who had sponsored it for years, like the online dating site NaziMingle.com. The only good news for Mr. Limbaugh today came from G.O.P. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who offered this muted statement of support: Look, I wouldnt have chosen the words he did. But its not like he called her a poor person or something. Elsewhere, exit polls in Russia showed that Vladimir Putin did particularly well among voters who described themselves as not wanting to be imprisoned. "
0,"N.B.A. superstar LeBron James has successfully erased the memory of his 2010 public-relations disaster by creating what might be the biggest public-relations disaster of all time, disaster experts confirmed today. While James alienated many sports fans with his infamous 2010 ESPN telecast The Decision, his handling of his 2014 free agency puts his 2010 effort to shame, train-wreck experts agree. Speaking as he embarked for the final of the World Cup, in Brazil, James confirmed that he and his team had worked long and hard to make Decision 2.0 a public-relations debacle that would live on indelibly in the publics consciousness for generations. I wasnt happy with what we put together in 2010, James said. Yeah, we infuriated millions of people, but I felt that this time around if we really brought our A game we could become despised in a legendary way. Im proud to say we got it done. James said that he was looking forward to his new contract expiring so that he could become a free agent again and antagonize anyone I didnt get to this time. I want to make Decision 3.0 even more catastrophic than 2.0, he said. But I recognize thats setting the bar very high. "
0,"Based on his performance in Thursday nights debate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has emerged as a leading candidate to manage an Enterprise Rent-a-Car branch, Enterprise has confirmed. Tracy Klugian, a human-resources director for the rental-car giant, said that he did not know what to expect before the debate, but after watching Walker in action he felt confident that the Wisconsinite had what it takes to succeed at Enterprise. He didnt get too many moments in the spotlight, but, just from what I saw, I would feel comfortable putting him behind one of our rental counters, he said. He indicated that the company would be contacting Walker in the days ahead to discuss a possible future with Enterprise. Just to be clear, no promises will be made, he said. Best-case scenario, Scott works hard and becomes the manager of one of our branches. For starters, wed like to train him to be an assistant manager and see how he does with that. Enterprises faith in Walker appears to be echoed by a new poll, which shows that thirty-one per cent of voters believe he is qualified to assistant-manage a rental-car branch.

0,"N.B.A. superstar LeBron James said Tuesday morning that he would announce the name of the team that he is signing with on Thursday at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be convened especially for that purpose. This decision affects everyone on the planet, James said. I want to let all the nations on Earth know at the same time. An emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday was deadlocked on the issue, with seven members wanting James to remain in Miami, seven others hoping for a return to Cleveland, and Lithuania abstaining. The Miami Heat president, Pat Riley, and the Cleveland Cavaliers owner, Dan Gilbert, both confirmed that they would be in the audience at the United Nations to hear James announce his decision. Im not going to lie: I wish hed tell me in advance, Riley said. But I guess Ill have to wait to hear along with Russia, China, Ecuador, and everybody else. Thats the way LeBron wants it. To help him with his decision, the N.B.A. star has assembled an esteemed circle of advisers, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the scientist Stephen Hawking, all of whom are expected to be in attendance for the United Nations announcement. The U.N. General Secretary, Ban Ki-moon, acknowledged on Tuesday that the world body had many other issues on its plate, including conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, but added, Its really hard to focus on anything until we know where LeBron is going.

0,"The Fox News Channel reported today that French voters have followed in the footsteps of their American counterparts by electing an openly Socialist man to the office of President. According to Fox host Sean Hannity, the two Socialist Presidents, Francois Hollande and Barack Obama, are expected to work closely together because they share a common goal: To make each of their countries the best possible version of France. Mr. Hannity said that he anticipates the two comrades to eventually merge into one transatlantic Socialist super-President called Obamalande. Remember, these two brothers-in-arms share a lot in common, besides being flaming Socialists, he said. They were both born outside the United States. There are already signs that Messrs. Obama and Hollande are collaborating, Mr. Hannity said, and the French know a thing or two about collaboration. The Fox News host said the two men have already exchanged ideas, such as the French adopting a version of Obamacare and the Americans surrendering in Afghanistan. In Paris, defeated French President Nicholas Sarkozy told reporters that he was looking forward to spending more time with his wife, Carla Bruni, adding, Have any of you seen her anywhere? In other international news, the Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng said he was eager to enjoy new freedoms in the United States but said, I will probably avoid Arizona. "
0,"In an outburst that shocked many onlookers at the Supreme Court today, Justice Antonin Scalia said that it made him angry beyond belief that he had to listen to people talking about gay couples all week. As Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned whether it was appropriate for the Court to hear a case about same-sex marriage at this time, Mr. Scalia stunned observers with an emotional outburst. O.K., could we just stop talking about this stuff right now? Justice Scalia snapped at Justice Kennedy. Ive told you all how I feel about this topic, and I dont understand why were going on and on about it unless you all hate me. As the courtroom froze in dead silence, Justice Scalia seemed to gather steam, shouting, For two days, its been gay this, gay that. Youre all just talking about this stuff as if its the most normal thing in the world. Well, its not, O.K.? Its weird and its wrong. And just talking about it like its O.K. and whatnot is making me angry beyond belief. As the other justices averted their eyes, Justice Scalia broke down, sobbing that he wished things were normal, the way they used to be. "
0,"An Ohio man has become infected with misinformation about the Ebola virus through casual contact with cable news, the Centers for Disease Control has confirmed. Tracy Klugian, thirty-one, briefly came into contact with alarmist Ebola hearsay during a visit to the Akron-Canton airport, where a CNN report about Ebola was showing on one of the televisions in the airport bar. Mr. Klugian is believed to have been exposed to cable news for no more than ten minutes, but long enough to become infected, a spokesman for the C.D.C. said. Within an hour, he was showing signs of believing that an Ebola outbreak in the United States was inevitable and unstoppable. Once Klugians condition was apparent, the Ohio man was rushed to a public library and given a seventh-grade biology textbook, at which point he started to stabilize, the spokesman said. But others exposed to the widening epidemic of Ebola misinformation may not be so lucky. A man in Oklahoma was exposed to Elisabeth Hasselbeck on Fox for over three minutes, the C.D.C. spokesman said gravely. We hope were not too late. "
0,"Republican Presidential candidates descended on Iowa over the weekend, giving Iowans a rare opportunity to evaluate all thirty thousand hopefuls in one place. The candidates were a big hit with their G.O.P. audience, who attempted to determine which of the thirty thousand would do the best job of eviscerating Obamacare and deporting college students. Attendees gave an especially warm welcome to the businessman Donald Trump, whose potential entry into the 2016 race would instantly raise the credibility of everyone else. In a speech laden with red meat for the Republican faithful, Trump explained how his experience of hosting a reality TV show would prove invaluable in defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). But Iowans reserved their most enthusiastic response for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who laid out an ambitious vision for depriving future generations of a living wage. Asked how he hopes history will remember him, Walker said, If I have my way, there will be no one teaching history. "
0," In what could be a prelude to a Presidential run in 2016, on Friday Joe Biden released to the public both e-mails that he has written while serving as Vice-President for the past six years. Biden took pride in announcing that he had sent both messages from his official government e-mail address, adding, I have nothing to hide. Minutes after the e-mails were released, the media pored over the treasure trove of materials, which offer a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into Bidens tenure as Vice-President. The first e-mail, written to President Obama in December of 2009, asks about the time and place of the White House holiday party. The second and last e-mail, written in May of last year, asks the President, Is our Internet slow today? Im trying to watch something, followed by a frowny-face emoticon. According to Bidens records, the President did not respond to either e-mail. "
0,"Hoping to quell the controversy over e-mails missing from her private account, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday released twenty thousand spam e-mails she received from Old Navy. In an effort to be transparent, I have gone above and beyond what is required of me by law and released every last e-mail I received from this retailer, she told reporters. Now I think we can all consider this case closed. The e-mails reveal an extensive one-way correspondence between Clinton and Old Navy, as the retailer sometimes contacted her up to a dozen times in a single day to inform her of sales and other offers. This is one of the main reasons I set up a private e-mail account, she said. I did not want spam from Old Navy clogging up the State Department servers. But if the former Secretary of State thought that she could end the controversy swirling around her e-mail account by releasing the Old Navy spam, she may have miscalculated. Representative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Benghazi select committee, questioned why Clinton would let twenty thousand spam e-mails from Old Navy accumulate rather than simply unsubscribe. It doesnt pass the smell test, he said. Responding to that allegation, Clinton said, I want the American people to know that, on multiple occasions, I tried to unsubscribe from Old Navy, and my requests were ignored. The most frustrating part of this whole affair is that Ive never even bought anything from Old Navy. "
0,"In what was described as a major ramping up of sanctions, Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Tuesday that the United States had frozen Russian President Vladimir Putins Netflix account, effective immediately. Unless and until Mr. Putin calls off the annexation of Crimea, no more House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black for him, Mr. Kerry said. The United States will not stand by and reward the annexation of another sovereign nation with a policy of streaming as usual. While all of the sanctions Mr. Kerry announced on Tuesday were Netflix-related, he warned Mr. Putin that nothing is off the table. Im sure I dont need to remind the Russian President that Game of Thrones is about to come back for another season, he said. As I have said, this thing could get very ugly, very fast. "

0,"What some insiders are calling a rash display of backbone last week could endanger Senator Elizabeth Warrens career as a Democrat, leading party operatives say. Harland Dorrinson, a strategist who has guided the campaigns of dozens of Democratic candidates, said that the Massachusetts legislators recklessly truthful tirade about banks left him smacking my head. She stood up for what she believed in and didnt try to water it down, he said. That is a serious violation of the Democratic playbook. Whenever youre talking about banks or Wall Street, its crucial that a Democrat sound as indistinguishable from a Republican as possible, he said. Apparently, Elizabeth Warren didnt get the memo. The strategist said that Warren could possibly salvage her career as a Democrat if her advisers dissuade her from further outbursts of integrity in the future. Theres still hope for her, he said. But someone needs to sit her down and say, We are the party of Dukakis, the party of Mondale. This is not how we roll. "
0,"In a break with tradition, Tea Party Republicans issued their official rebuttal to tonights State of the Union address a full twelve hours before President Obama was scheduled to deliver it. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) appeared on Fox News Channel at 9 A.M. (E.T.) to read the rebuttal, which some historians called the most brutal response ever to a Presidential speech that had not yet been made. Calling Mr. Obamas speech full of the same empty promises and bald-faced lies weve come to expect, Sen. Paul added that tonight Barack Obama made his case: for his own impeachment. Laced with sarcasm and invective, Sen. Pauls rebuttal eviscerated Mr. Obamas not-yet-given speech, ending with a call for the President to be tried for treason and banished from the U.S. Roger Ailes, President of Fox News Channel, defended the decision to air a blistering attack on a speech that Mr. Obama was not scheduled to give for another twelve hours: Our viewers are very unlikely to sit through Barack Obamas State of the Union address. Airing the rebuttal beforehand gives them a sense of what they would have thought was reprehensible about it. For his part, Sen. Paul made no apologies for calling a speech he had never actually heard worthy of President Ahmadinejad. Look, if I had waited to listen to the speech, I bet I would have hated it even more. "
0,"A trio of Republican senators today blasted U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice for misleading the American public, which, in the words of Sen. Lindsay Graham (R., S.C.), has traditionally been our job. Ambassador Rice has been engaged in nonstop lies and double-talk, said Sen. Graham, one of three Republican senators who had a closed-door meeting with Rice. If she really wants to do those things so badly, she should run for the U.S. Senate like the rest of us. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.) agreed with Sen. Grahams assessment, saying of the meeting, I heard Susan Rice spew nothing but half-truths, distortions, and complete fabrications. It felt like I was watching Fox News, except that shes black. The third senator, John McCain (R., Ariz.), said that he found Ambassador Rices story profoundly disappointing: Considering that the C.I.A. was involved, I thought thered be more sex.

We caught up with him as he took a breather for the Fouth of July, at his home in East Hampton. First of alland I have to ask thisGod particle? Really? Who started that? I have gotten so much shit for that! (laughs) I dont know where that started. Probably TMZ or somewhere! Look, if people want to call me that because they like what I do well, Im humbled. Its cool to know that what you do makes people happy. I love my fans. But God particle? I dont think so! I cant even get my iPhone to sync. (laughs) Speaking of what you do what do you do, exactly? Probably what Im best known for, for better or worse, is making atomic particles have mass. But I dont want to be pigeonholed as that, because I dont want to put limits on what I plan to do in the future. Like, right now Im doing a lot of things that dont involve atomic particles or mass or anything like that. For example, my menswear line. Its a joint venture between me and Hugo Boss. Its going to be called either Higgs Boss or Hugo Boson. Or we may go a whole different way and call it H. Biggy. My branding team is into it right now. I havent been this excited about something Ive been involved in since I created the universe. Also, theres gonna be a fragrance. Theres been a lot written about tension in your relationship with Peter Higgs, one of the scientists who discovered you. Any truth to the rumors? Peter and I are both very passionate about what we do, and when you put a passionate human being and a passionate subatomic particle together theres bound to be friction. We fight like brothers sometimes, but its only because we care so deeply about what were doing and we want to make it perfect. But as far as what happened in the club last week, no, I did not throw a bottle at his head. O.K., be honest, and no false modesty here: Is there anything the Higgs boson cant do? A: Honest answer? I want to be considered the Michael Jordan of subatomic particles. By that I mean, Michael Jordan might not have been the most physically gifted player in the history of the N.B.A., but nobody worked harder at his game than he did. Thats what Im all about. Whether its giving mass to matter, breaking electroweak symmetry, or explaining the origin of the universe and whatnot, I believe I can do it all. Could you have kept Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise together? A: Shit no! (laughs) "

The experts, who indicated that they were cautiously optimistic about the development, said that the gains were most likely to be made in the Midwest. The expected rise in I.Q. could mean that the average congressperson would have a greater grasp of basic concepts in math and science, including the law of evolution, as well as addition and subtraction. The last time a branch of the federal government experienced such a significant increase in average I.Q., experts said, was the executive branch in 2009. "

It was a rare public utterance for the late Ms. Rand, who has been damned to eternal torment in Satans lake of fire since 1982. This is a budget I wish I had written, said Ms. Rand, pausing to scream as white-hot flames licked her face. Paul Ryan is a great man and I look forward to meeting him someday. Rep. Ryan acknowledged Ms. Rands praise with humility, telling reporters, Theres no trick to cutting $4.6 trillion once you take a hard look at failed ideas of the past, such as the social contract. Mr. Ryan added, Unlike the Democrats plan, my budget has new ideas, like cutting two of the four food groups and classifying large sodas as medicine. Ms. Rands thumbs-up capped a victory lap of sorts for Mr. Ryan, who earlier in the day garnered an endorsement from Marie Antoinette. "

This. Is. HUGE. The pretzel will be the centerpiece of this falls exhibition, The Physical Carvey, which also includes a 3D display of Choppin Broccoli and the padded muscleman suit worn by Carveys iconic SNL character Hans. The San Franciscobased museum will keep the pretzel in a climate-controlled case in order to preserve the exact discoloration and warping it endured from landing in Garths tropical-themed cocktail. Even for a museum known to set a pretty high standard, this is a groundbreaking achievement. In fact, the pretzel alone puts this upcoming showcase on par with the very popular Mr. Carvey Goes To Washington exhibit, which ran during the 2012 election season and featured dueling holograms of Carveys impersonations of George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. We cant wait! But in the meantime, fans are encouraged to check out the fully restored Church Lady piano, on loan from The Dana Carvey Institute and available for viewing between now and August 31. "
0,"Tuesdays announcement by President Obama that 7.1 million people have signed up for Obamacare set off a firestorm of controversy among opponents of math in the U.S. Congress. Representative Michele Bachmann, a leading member of the anti-math caucus, told reporters, Throughout the debate on Obamacare, there has been a tacit agreement to leave math out of it. Today, President Obama broke that agreement. Senator John Barrasso, an anti-math Republican from Wyoming, agreed. Its very disappointing to see the President use arithmetic for political purposes, he said. Bachmann said that she believed the American people would see through President Obamas desperate use of numbers. She added, Whenever this President gets in trouble, he hides behind data. The Minnesota Republican said that many others in Congress agreed with her, but she declined to count them. "
0," A total absence of actual information about the missing Malaysia flight is not in any way hindering twenty-four-hour coverage of the story, the major cable news networks confirmed today. As a news network, we regard a lack of news as a worthy challenge, the CNN chief Jeff Zucker said. Our people are doing a heroic job of filling the void with rumor and hearsay. A spokesperson for MSNBC, however, scoffed at Mr. Zuckers assessment that there was no information about the missing plane. We are receiving tons of erroneous and conflicting reports from authorities every hour, and the instant we get them we pass them on to our viewers, he said. Over at Fox, host Sean Hannity expressed confidence in his networks coverage. When it comes to broadcasting twenty-four hours a day with no verifiable facts, I wouldnt trade our experience and expertise for anybodys, he said. Promising that the network was working overtime to generate new unfounded conspiracy theories, Mr. Hannity said, Weve put our whole Benghazi team on this. "
0,"Senate Republicans today vowed to filibuster a controversial bill supporting the right not to get shot. G.O.P. leaders lambasted the bill, arguing that the right to go to school, work, or ones home without fear of being shot was not guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The Second Amendment makes it very clear, said Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming). The right to bear arms shall not be infringed by a tiny minoritys desire not to be shot. But according to the pollster Harland Dorrinson, of OpinionFact Polling, the right not to get shot, while controversial, is beginning to gain traction with the American electorate. Like gay marriage, not getting shot is an idea that has taken some getting used to, but people are starting to wrap their brains around it, he said. Poll numbers notwithstanding, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said today that he would join the effort to filibuster any not-getting-shot-related bill: The only way we Republicans can protect our democracy is by preventing a vote.

Without the massive pipeline, Carson told Fox News, the nations network of silos is woefully inadequate to store the bounty of grain that we soweth. Carson said that as President, he would seek additional places to store grain, such as the hollowed-out heads on Mt. Rushmore. A nations greatness is measured by its ability to store grain, he said. I will return America to its former greatness. "
0," President Obama has sparked outrage in Congress and renewed calls for his impeachment by signing a daring Presidential memorandum that would pay workers enough to eat. The memorandum, which is based on the Presidents view that people should be paid for the hours they actually work, is shaping up as one of the most controversial and incendiary actions of his Presidency. House Republican leaders held a press conference this morning to warn Obama that, by advancing his agenda of paying people for the work they do, he is playing with political fire. A Presidential memorandum is a powerful tool and should be used sparingly, said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). It is not a vehicle for this President to enact his pet theories about people earning enough to survive. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) concurred, telling reporters, With one stroke of the pen, President Obama is removing the single greatest incentive for work: hunger. Apparently, President Obama needs a lesson in American history, he said. Hunger built the railroads. Hunger picked the crops. When the American people learn more about this action of the Presidents, they will see it for what it is: a hunger-killer. Photograph by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty. "
0,"Opponents of Floridas Stand Your Ground law are attempting to mobilize support for a new law called Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason. The proposed law, which faces major opposition in the Florida legislature, would make it illegal for people in the state to shoot each other for no reason whatsoever. Under the provisions of Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason, you will be required to have an actual reason for shooting someone, said a spokesman for the measure, Harland Dorrinson. This will be a first in Florida. The controversial bill has already drawn the ire of the National Rifle Association, which issued a statement today saying that requiring someone to have a reason to shoot another person would violate the Second Amendment. If you force someone to have a reason to shoot someone, soon you will be taking away his right to shoot that person altogether, the N.R.A. said. We are not in principle against the idea of having a reason to shoot someone, the N.R.A. continued. But we believe you should be allowed to shoot the person first and have the reason second. Even if Dont Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason somehow passes in the legislature, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said today that he would veto it, telling reporters, Making people in Florida have a reason to shoot each other would fundamentally change our way of life. "

0,"Ever since 9-year-old Nathan Schneider was admitted to the hospital a month ago, he has been a truly brave guy. Doctors diagnosed him with a serious thyroid condition that resulted in the growth of a large tumor on his neck, but Nathan has kept his spirits up. When Nathans favorite actor, Chris Pratt, heard about his courageous story, he gave the young Guardians Of The Galaxy superfan the surprise of a lifetime: He stopped by Nathans room for a visit last week, although you could kinda tell it was just to check out the massive tumor. Wow! What an amazing thing for Chris to do. Nathan was ecstatic when Star-Lord himself walked into his hospital room, but it might have been better if Chris didnt immediately start asking the fourth-grader a rapid-fire list of questions about how much the tumor weighs and if there are any teeth in there. Chris gave Nathan a series of signed limited-edition Guardians Of The Galaxy posters, but it was pretty clear that he only did that so he could touch the tumor while Nathan was distracted by looking at them. While the mega-celeb should be applauded for going to visit Nathan in the hospital at all, it might have made for a better story if Chris hadnt Instagrammed out the picture of him and Nathan with the hashtag #checkthisthingout. This is definite proof that Chris Pratt is one of the sweetest guys in Hollywood! Would it have been nice had the actor not repeatedly asked Nathan if he could control it? Sure. Still, we salute Chris, who didnt even come dressed up as Star-Lord or his character from Jurassic Park, for making one fans dream come true! The bottom line is that the amazing Chris Pratt deserves a lot of credit for taking the time out of his busy schedule to visit a sick fan, and we should assume positive intent here, even though Chris asked the attending nurse if he could have a piece of it after they cut the tumor off of Nathan in a few weeks. Get better soon, Nathan! "

McCrory told reporters that the thousand officers are only the first wave of a bathroom-patrol force that will eventually swell to over fifty thousand. This is job creation at its finest, he said. In addition to making North Carolina proud of its bathrooms again, McCrory said, the states new law should boost tourism, as visitors from around the world clamor to watch North Carolinas unique bathroom-enforcement program in action.

In reality, this photo actually shows two brothers, The Amazing Branzottis, who were circus performers and Siamese twins connected at the mouth. Their popular sideshow act was hired to march in the parade as entertainment for the returning troops. 2. Migrant Mother The desperation and hopelessness of the Great Depression was effectively captured in this gritty image of a family down on their luckor was it?

The Cool Cigarette Friends This photo of three pals hanging out embodies old-school cool, but didnt it always seem odd that the Cigarette Friend on the far right wasnt smoking? The explanation is that he had just extinguished his spent cigarette by putting it in his mouth and then swallowing it, like the badass he was. 4. Einstein Sticking Out Tongue Albert Einstein spent his career calculating how subatomic particles behave, but until immigrating to the U.S., he never got a chance to taste an electron. This was the great physicists delighted reaction after licking a spoonful of pure electrons at the Princeton cafeteria. 5. Buzz Aldrin With U.S. Flag On Moon NASA was forced to subtly doctor this image when the Apollo 11 astronauts accidentally brought a banner that said Russia was here first to the moon instead of an American flag. Photo editors later corrected this error by altering it into the intended stars and stripes. 6. Afghan Girl Travelers in the wilderness of Afghanistan long claimed to catch glimpses of the fabled Afghan Girl, but photographic evidence of her existence was always blurry and dubious. Then, in 1984, a prankster fooled the world with this hoax photo, even reaching the cover of National Geographic before getting caught. Later, he revealed he faked Afghan Girl by taping a basketball to an umbrella. 7. A Nice Brunch Talk about being in the right place at the right time! This world-famous photograph captured a rare image of waffles and coffee right next to a plate of eggs and bacon. Unfortunately, shortly after this picture was shot, all the food was tragically eaten. 8. Situation Room This image is often mislabeled as showing the White House Situation Room during the 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden. In actuality, this is a meeting that the national security team had held the previous day, when the army brought out a dead body to show what they were trying to turn bin Laden into. President Obama gave the corpse a thumbs-up and authorized the mission. "
0,"President Barack Obamas increasing popularity is forcing congressional Democrats to consider admitting that they know him, a leading Democratic staffer revealed on Monday. After months of denying ever having been in the same room as the President, some Democrats are tentatively rethinking that position now that his approval rating has hit fifty per cent, the staffer said. Were watching that number very closely, the Democratic staffer Robinson Petrack said. We could be looking at a scenario where its safe to acknowledge his existence again. Petrack said that while many congressional Democrats have not used the word Obama in a sentence since the Presidents approval rating dropped to thirty-nine percent last year, they are toying with the idea of resuming that practice now. But even as Democrats contemplate admitting that they have met Obama or even shaken his hand, some worry that such moves could have perilous consequences if his approval rating drops again. I say, lets cross that bridge when we come to it, Petrack said. If you dont know when to admit you know your President and when to desert him, you dont deserve to call yourself a Democrat. "

The biggest danger isnt the United Statesits burnout. Kim said that he made his decision over the past weekend, after he issued his forty-ninth official statement threatening to engulf the mainland U.S. in a nuclear Armageddon: I was in the middle of saying infernal sea of fire, and I kind of realized, hey, Im just phoning it in. And I never want to be that guy. By resting his violent rhetoric on weekends, Kim said, On Monday through Friday Ill have the insanity and unmitigated rage necessary to do this job right. Referring to his streak of three hundred and fifty-two consecutive days in which he threatened to destroy the world, Kim said, Im proud of it, sure. But nothing lasts forever.

Boehner, who personally extended the invitation to Laggett, said that he did not consult with the President before contacting his high-school nemesis. This has nothing to do with the President, Boehner said. Many of us in Congress are very interested in what Mr. Laggett has to say. According to a source who attended high school with both men, Laggetts antipathy for the President began when Obama was chosen over him for the post of sports editor on the school newspaper. Kevin has totally despised him ever since, the source said. Reached in Honolulu, where he works as an assistant manager at Applebees, Laggett said that his speech to Congress would steer clear of personal issues between him and Obama. Im going to leave that stuff at the door, he said. Im just going to talk about the job hes doing as President, which hes screwing up pretty bad, in my opinion. At the White House, the President responded testily when asked if he intended to watch Laggetts speech. Kevin is a tool, he said. "

In the aftermath of the report, the Jets owner, Woody Johnson, blasted the Patriots coach, Bill Belichick, and called his lack of interest in the Jets playbook an insult to this organization and our fans. When our teams meet next, you can bet that the Patriots failure to steal our playbook is going to be a big motivator in the locker room, Johnson said.

To say that what followed this decision was a shitstorm would be a massive understatement.

0,"The world of boxing suffered the loss of an all-time great today. World Boxing Council officials announced this morning that the iguana who shouts Lets get ready to rumble! before every match has died. According to officials, the esteemed reptile was found dead in its terrarium just after midnight. It was 18 years old. A staple in the boxing community, the iguana was best known for its unique and beloved ritual at the most anticipated bouts of the year. At the beginning of every match for the past 15 years, the 2-foot-long tropical reptile would be ceremonially carried into the ring by an old man who would then hoist it up to the microphone to shout Lets get ready to rumble before the nights main event. Shortly after making the announcement, the WBC tweeted out a tribute to the iguana: In a sport often shrouded in controversy and shifting alliances, the iguana was a rare mainstay, a legend who became as anticipated a fan attraction as any of the A-list celebrities spotted ringside at marquee events. It shouted Lets get ready to rumble before some of the most defining moments in boxing: Mayweather vs. Hatton; Hopkins vs. Taylor I & II; all four Pacquiao vs. Marquez bouts; the list goes on. And though it was unclear if the reptile ever knew what it all meant, its appearances were a hit with fans. Said former president of HBO Sports, Ken Hershman: The presence of the iguana transcended the niche audience. Sometimes, they had to give it a little squeeze to get it going, but once that reptile delivered, you knew it was a real match. Many boxers immediately took to social media to express their condolences: The iguana was next scheduled to shout Lets get ready to rumble! before the light heavyweight bout between Sergey Kovalev and Jean Pascal on January 30. Instead, the fight will open with a moment of silence, followed by the customary 10-bell salute. "
0,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie withdrew from consideration as a Presidential candidate today after becoming embroiled in what a leading Republican strategist called a career-ending empathy scandal. After signing a law barring licensed therapists from engaging in so-called gay conversion therapy, Mr. Christie stunned his fellow Republicans by seemingly expressing compassion for gay children, thus disqualifying himself from any further role in the G.O.P. Showing empathy for gays or children would have been bad enough, says Republican strategist Harland Dorrinson, one of many party leaders who called for Mr. Christie to withdraw. But empathy for gay children is a flat-out betrayal. In a brief statement to reporters, Mr. Christie expressed remorse for what he called my unfortunate and ill-considered display of understanding for people different from myself, and urged the people of New Jersey to remember my strong record of cutting funds for schools and the elderly. While Mr. Christie might try to regain his fellow Republicans trust by vetoing more assault-rifle bans, G.O.P. strategist Tracy Klugian says that the governor does not deserve another chance, citing his dangerous flirtations with compassion in the past. After Hurricane Sandy, Chris Christie worried a lot of us with his recklessly sensitive behavior, says Mr. Klugian. But we really thought he had put this problem behind him. Mr. Christies latest empathy scandal has left Mr. Klugian, like many other Republicans, shaking his head: Its sad to see such a promising career end this way. But maybe this will force him to get the help he needs. "

As of Monday, visitors to Bertollis website are at last able to select Palestine from its Choose Your Country drop-down menu. Other companies, pay attention: This is what progress looks like. While Palestines status as a sovereign nation remains hotly contested within the international community, with this one simple gesture, Bertolli has shown everyone that its not afraid to take a stand on Palestines behalf. And as Palestinians continue to struggle for their independence, acts like these send the message that their fight is not in vain. Visitors clicking through with Palestine selected are able to browse Bertolli sauces and Mediterranean-style frozen dinners, discover easy recipes, and learn about the companys long history of top-quality goods, all in Palestinian Arabic. While Bertolli hasnt made any fanfare about the change, it definitely hasnt gone overlooked: Its hard to say whether this will change any minds about Palestines ongoing struggle for independence, but one thing is clear: The people of Palestine have a friend in Bertolli.

But from a seemingly hopeless situation comes a much-needed beacon of hope: Fresca just made a donation of 10 two-liter bottles of Fresca to the people of Flint! Frescas donation couldnt have come at a better time for the thousands of Flint residents who lack clean drinking water. Delivered by truck early Wednesday morning, the 10 two-liter bottles of Fresca will help meet the needs of the citys most vulnerable residents until a more permanent solution to the water crisis can be implemented. Immediately following Frescas delivery, aid workers at an emergency relief center unloaded all 10 bottles of the calorie-free citrus drink onto a wooden table with a sign reading FREE SODA, making it available to those who need it most. Fresca is pleased to assist ongoing relief efforts in Flint with this donation of 10 brand-new bottles of our soft drink, the company stated in a press release. Access to clean, safe beverages is a basic human right, and we are proud to stand with the people of Flint during this time of crisis. Wow. This just goes to show that there are still some good people out there. Heres hoping other soft-drink companies will step up and follow Frescas lead! "
0," A climate-change march that organizers claim was the largest on record is nevertheless unlikely to change the minds of idiots, a survey of Americas idiots reveals. Despite bringing attention to a position that is embraced by more than ninety per cent of the worlds scientists, the Peoples Climate March, which took place on Sunday in New York City, left a broad majority of the nations idiots unconvinced. Look, if hundreds of thousands of people want to march about something, its a free country, said Carol Foyler, an idiot from Kenosha, Wisconsin. But let me ask them something: if the climate is really getting warmer, why was it so cold up here last winter? Harland Dorrinson, an idiot from Hollywood, Florida, was also unmoved by the message of Sundays march. What these marchers dont realize is that the planet goes through natural cycles of heating and cooling, he said. Blaming people for global warming is like blaming dinosaurs for the ice age. Skepticism about scientists characterized many of the idiots remarks, including those of Tracy Klugian, of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Those marchers are holding signs that say Scientists this, scientists that, he said. Well, how can scientists be sure that the Earth was colder thousands of years ago, when no one had invented a thermometer? Klugian said he was confident that, despite the impressive numbers for Sundays march, idiots would prevail in the ongoing climate-change debate. At the end of the day, there are more people like us in Congress, he said. "
0," Suspects in the recent biker brawl in Waco, Texas, only slightly outnumber the 2016 Republican Presidential candidates, leading some voters to have difficulty distinguishing between the two groups, a new poll shows. According to the poll, voters who were presented the names of a biker-brawl suspect and a Republican Presidential candidate correctly identified both only thirty per cent of the time. For example, fifty-seven per cent of voters erroneously identified the former Texas Governor Rick Perry as a member of the Bandidos motorcycle gang, while forty-one per cent believed he belonged to the Cossacks. Adding to voters confusion, the biker brawlers and G.O.P. candidates have identical views on a host of issues, such as gun rights and whether they would feel comfortable attending a gay wedding. While the number of biker-brawl suspects stands at a hundred and seventy, if current trends continue, the Republican field could blow past that number by early summer, possibly deepening voters confusion. But, in one positive sign for the Republicans, they notched a higher approval rating than the Waco suspects, five per cent to three. "
0,"In a move that some political observers are calling unprecedented, the Romney campaign today officially requested that Ann Romney be permitted to stand next to her husband during his three scheduled debates with President Obama. While the request drew immediate howls of protest from the Obama campaign, Mrs. Romney issued an official statement claiming that she was not trying to give her husband an unfair advantage. I want to stand next to Mitt for my benefit, not his, Mrs. Romneys statement read. Mitt is so human and so warm, I cant imagine being away from his warm humanity for as long as two hours. Thats how warm a human he is. Really warm and really human. But Mrs. Romneys statement doesnt pass the smell test, says University of Minnesota political science professor Davis Logsdon, who studied the Romneys Sunday appearance on NBCs Meet the Press and noticed Mrs. Romney emitting a series of barely detectable signals and cues. When we slowed down the video, we noticed that Ann was squeezing Mitts right knee with what appears to be a vise-like grip, Dr. Logsdon says. From what we could decipher, one squeeze signified agree, two squeezes were disagree, and three were shut up and let me answer that one. Based on Mr. Romneys performance, in which he at times disagreed with his running mate Paul Ryan and agreed with President Obama, Dr. Logsdon believes that Mrs. Romneys presence by her husbands side at the debates would be of little use. Ann Romney is clearly trying very hard, but she had more success training her dressage horse, he says. "
0,"In what his campaign described today as a bold strategy to insure victory in the Presidential contest, Republican nominee Mitt Romney will undergo a procedure to have his mouth wired shut until Tuesday, November 6th. The decision reportedly was made in response to the release earlier in the day of rare video footage showing Mr. Romney saying what he really thinks. In the video, Mr. Romney blasts the American people for being insanely obsessed with food, clothing, and shelter, and asserts that many of them are too lazy to hide their money overseas. At another point in the video, Mr. Romney refers to his own hardscrabble childhood: I was never handed anything in life. If I wanted to cut a gay kids hair off, I had to pin him to the ground myself. Romney campaign aides were upbeat about the mouth-wiring procedure today, with some saying they wished they had thought of it months ago. When asked about the procedure at a campaign stop in Ohio, Mr. Romney said, Mmmnff ffnn mmfff nnnnnff. Andy Borowitz will be doing a free show at Rutgers University on Monday, October 29th at 7 P.M.

0,"Minutes after overturning Tom Bradys four-game suspension for the 2015-16 N.F.L. season, federal judge Richard M. Berman raised eyebrows by admitting that he had the Patriots quarterback on his fantasy team. Responding to reporters questions, Berman said that Bradys inclusion on his fantasy roster played no role whatsoever in his judicial decision. As a federal judge, I made this ruling based strictly on legal precedents and the merits of the case, Berman said. But, as a fantasy-team owner, sure, its going to be awesome to see Tom in there for all sixteen games. The judge said that he was especially looking forward to seeing how Brady takes advantage of what he called an amazing array of offensive weapons. Gronk is going to have a big year, and even if Julian Edelman isnt ready for Week One, I think Reggie Wayne is going to surprise a lot of people, Berman, who also has selected Wayne for his fantasy team, said. For his part, Brady minimized the role that Bermans fantasy team might have played in Thursdays legal victory. A wins a win, he said. "

As the Pope visits Washington, New York, and Philadelphia, people from every walk of life are expressing profound gratitude that the news media is offering non-stop coverage of Franciss every move instead of Trumps, if only for five days. Carol Foyler, of New York, said that the Popes visit would wreak havoc with traffic in Manhattan this week, but added, I would put up with that all year long if it meant seeing less of that [expletive] Trumps face. Even Americans who would not normally be expected to take an interest in the Popes visit, like agnostics and atheists, are wildly enthusiastic about the role Francis has played in momentarily ousting Trump from the headlines. I have never believed in God and I never will, said Harland Dorrinson, who is a Philadelphia-based atheist. Still, a miracle like a week without Trump kind of makes you think. Avram Heselstein, an Orthodox Jew, said he will join thousands of New Yorkers in Central Park, on Friday, to pay homage to the Pope. This isnt about being Jewish or Catholic, he said. This is about a man who just did something wonderful for everybody. Watch: In his first public appearance in New York, Pope Francis took part in evening prayers at St. Patricks Cathedral. "
0,"One day after his campaign manager quit, the mayoral candidate Anthony D. Weiner named his penis to the post, telling reporters, He was already making most of the major decisions, anyway. In announcing the new appointment, Mr. Weiner lavished praise upon his penis, calling him a tough hombre who cares about the struggles of ordinary, middle-class New Yorkers. After one reporter questioned the wisdom of naming his penis to such an important role in the campaign, Mr. Weiner dismissed that concern, saying, Look, hes gotten me this far. While Mr. Weiners decision to give the top job to his controversial appendage raised eyebrows among political observers, insiders said the move merely reflected his headline-grabbing members already prominent role in the campaign. He [Mr. Weiners penis] has been calling the shots for weeks now, one source said, adding that clashes between the former campaign manager Danny Kedem and the mercurial body part had led to Mr. Kedems exit. There was a power struggle between Danny and the package, and Danny lost, said one campaign source. Danny would try to talk sense to Anthony, but at the end of the day, the penis had his ear. "
0,"A delegation of conservative members of Congress paid a visit to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt today to witness firsthand what one of them called the most beautiful expression of the free market Ive ever seen. The author of that remark, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), said that he was awestruck after watching gigantic chunks of glacier disintegrate and crash to the sea. Every schoolchild in America needs to see this, he said. This is the free market at work in the way that God and Ayn Rand intended. Rep. Ryan said that watching the now-unstoppable Ice Sheet melt in action reaffirmed his belief in the glory and might of free-market forces. Now more than ever, I believe that government needs to get out of the way of glaciers, he said. Another member of the delegation, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota), decried what she called the alarmism surrounding reports of the collapsing Ice Sheet. The Ice Sheet melt is only a problem if you live in Antarctica, which, honestly, is a pretty dumb place to live, she said. Polar bears live in Antarctica because they have no choice, but were not polar bears. "
0,"The number of official candidates for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination has risen to thirteen, according to officials at the Centers for Disease Control. The count had stood at twelve since the announcement last week by the reality-show host Donald Trump, leading many at the C.D.C. to privately hope that the epidemic was losing steam. But with the entry of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal into the race on Wednesday, the C.D.C. was forced to hold a press conference to announce the worrisome news that the number of candidates had increased yet again. It might have been misplaced optimism on our part, but we had started to believe that this thing had been contained, said the C.D.C. spokesman Dr. Harland Dorrinson. Regrettably, it has not. While scientists disagree about how running for President spreads from person to person, most epidemiologists believe that a candidacy needs an environment rich in narcissism and delusionplus a host to feed on, ideally a sociopathic billionaire. The C.D.C. spokesman refused to address speculation that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would soon enter the race, bringing the number of candidates to fourteen. I dont want to say anything that might cause the public to panic, he said. Watch: An episode of Mary Norriss Comma Queen about the distinction between who and whom. "
0," Scientists have discovered a powerful new strain of fact-resistant humans who are threatening the ability of Earth to sustain life, a sobering new study reports. The research, conducted by the University of Minnesota, identifies a virulent strain of humans who are virtually immune to any form of verifiable knowledge, leaving scientists at a loss as to how to combat them. These humans appear to have all the faculties necessary to receive and process information, Davis Logsdon, one of the scientists who contributed to the study, said. And yet, somehow, they have developed defenses that, for all intents and purposes, have rendered those faculties totally inactive. More worryingly, Logsdon said, As facts have multiplied, their defenses against those facts have only grown more powerful. While scientists have no clear understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the fact-resistant humans from absorbing data, they theorize that the strain may have developed the ability to intercept and discard information en route from the auditory nerve to the brain. The normal functions of human consciousness have been completely nullified, Logsdon said. While reaffirming the gloomy assessments of the study, Logsdon held out hope that the threat of fact-resistant humans could be mitigated in the future. Our research is very preliminary, but its possible that they will become more receptive to facts once they are in an environment without food, water, or oxygen, he said. "
0,"In a sharply critical op-ed piece for the Russian Web site Pravda, Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) called Russian President Vladimir Putin a brutal, freedom-hating tyrant and challenged Mr. Putin to tear down the Berlin Wall. The Wall stands as a symbol of your failed, repressive system, Sen. McCain said. Until you tear it down, the world will see you and your Soviet goons for what you are: relics destined for the dustbin of history. Mr. Putin, tear down that wall, Sen. McCains editorial pointedly concluded. Several hours after the article was published, the Russian Federation issued a terse statement, indicating that the Berlin Wall had been torn down. Responding to the Russian statement, Sen. McCain told reporters, This shows what you can achieve when you talk tough with Putin. If only President Obama realized that. Sen. McCain added that he was delighted by the response to his Pravda editorial and was already writing a new one, urging Mr. Putin to remove his missiles from Cuba. Photograph by Samantha Sais/Reuters. "

The G.O.P., which has benefited from the support of so-called low-information voters in recent years, accused Obama of cynically trying to make people smarter as a way of chipping away at the Republican base. You take low-information voters and give them information, and pretty soon theyre Democrats, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.

0,"Former President Bill Clinton apologized last night for reading what he called a severely abbreviated version of his Convention speech, saying that he had planned to read a very educational and interesting nine-hour version but lost his nerve. I dont know what happens to me when I get up in front of a crowd like that, he said. I kind of tighten up and feel the need to rush through things. Mr. Clinton said that the longer version of his speech was packed with good stuff, including a detailed proposal to fix the United States Postal Service, an elaborate discussion of Americas fisheries and waterways, and a complete recitation of the Fleetwood Mac back catalogue. As it was, the shortened version of his speech was interrupted by standing ovations many times, including for his reading of a section of the Manhattan phone book. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his speech went over well with its intended audience of diehard Democrats, who responded with many congratulatory e-mails and over twenty thousand proposals of marriage.

Pure epicness! For six years after Richards tweet, Taylor managed to slowly and deliberately ruin his life in every way possible. Awesome! She started off by toying with him a bit, mailing him anonymous one-word letters that simply said Wait, but things escalated quickly from there. Soon, Taylor convinced the higher-ups at Richards office that he was embezzling funds, leading to his termination. Before long, she got Richard audited by the IRS, had his car impounded multiple times, and even paid off his doctor to give him a false cancer diagnosis. And if thats not enough, what she did next is even more mind-blowing! Taylor started hanging out around Richards parents home in upstate Georgia, gradually gaining their trust and confidence. Then, when they thought of Taylor as practically a second daughter, she showed them forged records convincing them that Richard was not their son and that he was switched at birth with another baby. Richards estrangement from his entire family has been irreparable ever since. Amazing! You show those haters, Tay Tay! Richard has since deleted his Twitter account and issued numerous public apologies to Swift. Ive lost everything, Richard said in a statement. Ive lost my job, my own parents no longer know who I am, and my credit score has been damaged so badly that I can never buy or rent a home again. Taylor Swift convinced my wife that I was cheating on her, and she left me, Richard added. Then I think Taylor slept with her. Please, Taylor Swift, just let this end. Is the beef truly over? No one knows, but one things for sure: Itll be a long time before Richard trolls Taylor again! "

According to the survey, job-seeking Americans hope that Congress will eventually do something about job creation, but they are adamant that it hold new hearings about Benghazi first. By a wide majority, respondents to the poll strongly agreed with the statement I would really like to find a job, but not if it in any way distracts Congress from my No. 1 concern: finding out what really happened in Benghazi. In related findings, a survey of Americans found that taxpayers overwhelmingly consider Benghazi hearings to be the best use of taxpayer money, well ahead of schools, roads, and infant nutrition. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner released the following statement: I want to reassure the American people that, until we have completed our Benghazi investigations, there will be absolutely no action on job creation, infrastructure, immigration, education, housing, or food.

And leading the pack is Necco Wafers, which just pledged to feature a person of color the next time it makes a commercial! Wow. This rules! When you open up a roll of Necco Wafers, you see the colors of the rainbow, said Necco spokeswoman Michelle Graber in a press release this morning.

This decision affects everyone on the planet, James said. I want to let all the nations on Earth know at the same time. An emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday was deadlocked on the issue, with seven members wanting James to remain in Miami, seven others hoping for a return to Cleveland, and Lithuania abstaining. The Miami Heat president, Pat Riley, and the Cleveland Cavaliers owner, Dan Gilbert, both confirmed that they would be in the audience at the United Nations to hear James announce his decision. Im not going to lie: I wish hed tell me in advance, Riley said. But I guess Ill have to wait to hear along with Russia, China, Ecuador, and everybody else. Thats the way LeBron wants it.

0," A controversial new bill in the Texas House of Representatives would require those running for governor to show proof of the minimum I.Q. necessary to perform the duties of the office. If the bill were to become law, every politician in Texas with gubernatorial ambitions would be issued an I.D. card featuring his or her photo, current address, and performance on a state-administered I.Q. test. Carol Foyler, one of the co-sponsors of the bill, acknowledged that the idea of a minimum I.Q. for candidates was viewed as incendiary in some circles, but insisted that the requirements of the I.D. card were not onerous. All they have to do is show mastery of simple tasks, such as uttering complete sentences and things of that nature, she said. But the bill faces an uphill fight in the House, where representatives like Harland Dorrinson, of Plano, have vowed to defeat it. I know that the folks behind this so-called bill are well meaning, Dorrinson said. But if this had been enacted fifteen years ago, it would have choked off our supply of governors. "

According to a new survey by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, the American people hold the nations billionaires in lower esteem than ever before, and a majority would like to see new laws enacted to deport them. They come here, take thousands of our jobs, and export them overseas, one respondent said, in an opinion echoed by many others in the survey. They are part of a shadow economy that sucks billions of dollars out of the United States every year and puts it in Switzerland and the Caymans, another said. Images of hedge-fund managers arriving via helicopter in the Hamptons this summer have only reinforced the impression that authorities have turned a blind eye to their movements. Many of these people should be in prison, and the government is looking the other way, one respondent said. Stirring even more controversy is the billionaires practice of having babies in the United States and using the nations porous estate-tax laws to pass down untold wealth to the next generation. They should leave and take their children with them, one respondent said. Even after it is pointed out to respondents that some billionaires, such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, have made significant philanthropic contributions to the world, a majority of those polled stubbornly maintained their negative views of billionaires. Look, in every group youre going to have some good ones, one of the respondents said. But that doesnt take away from the fact that the vast majority of these people are destroying this country.

If not, youll unfortunately have to wait until next year when the tree once again bursts chaotically, its extremities thrashing with energy after months of rest. But, hey, falls not so bad!

0,"It looks like love has won again! With its latest ruling, the Supreme Court has cemented its place in history by legalizing marriage between nine people who love each other very much. Yup. Barely hours into their first day back in session, the court passed the ruling, stating the rights provided to two people seeking marriage are inalienable, and should therefore be extended to groups of six men and three women who love and respect each other personally and professionally. Wow! Its truly a beautiful day to be alive. Coming on the heels of the courts ruling on same-sex marriage in June, the decision means that, for the first time, nine people will be able to consummate their love in a legally binding bond! Its an incredible step forward that many assumed theyd never see in their lifetime. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the stirring majority opinion, echoing the feelings of many who have long dreamed of this day: At last, the time has arrived for a group of people who have waited for years for this right. A group whose members might not always agree, but one that is built on a foundation of mutual respect and admiration. A group that has often deliberated long into the night, developing the kind of understanding and love that can only be forged through the nakedness of impassioned discourse and unbridled physical attraction. Goosebumps. Of course, not everyone was pleased with the ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the only dissent, voicing his concern that the court was overstepping its bounds: Regardless of the opinions of this court, I urge my colleagues to exercise restraint. If nine people are as deeply in love as I believe they are, there is no need to put a label on it. There is no constitutional basis for recognizing a group of nine partners as something more than that, despite how right it may feel. This is a matter best left up to the states. Yikes. Well, despite the chief justices protests, its still a day for the rest of America to celebrate love for everyone. Equality win! "

Just days after the Arizona legislature passed a law that would enable businesses to discriminate against gays, it emerged that gays spend billions of dollars in Arizona each yearan unexpected development that seemed to take many legislators by surprise. Carol Foyler, a Tea Party Republican who supported the anti-gay law, said that the startling bombshell that gays play a role in the states economy put her and her fellow lawmakers in a tight spot. Quite frankly, we were blindsided by this, she said. We had no idea that gays had money and bought things just like regular people do. Acknowledging that her vote for the anti-gay law might have been calamitous for the states economy, Ms. Foyler placed the blame for it squarely on the shoulders of one group: the gays themselves. How was I supposed to know what gay people do with their money, etc., when I dont personally know any gay people? she asked. Im sorry, but it was up to the gays to tell us. "

0,"Well, this could be a big problem. Right in the middle of a campaign rally Sunday in his home state of Vermont, a thought bubble with pornography inside of it appeared over Bernie Sanders head. According to witnesses, the Democratic presidential candidate was delivering a statement about empowering and rehabilitating the American middle class when a series of small, white clouds ballooned out of his head before blossoming into a large, billowing cloud featuring the image of a man and a woman having sex on a bed. Sanders tried to pop the thought bubble with a pencil, but unfortunately, each time he reached up and jabbed at the thought bubble, it only got larger and more sexually graphic. Sources say that the thought bubble continued to float above Sanders head throughout the rally, displaying a constant string of pornography that ranged from tastefully shot softcore erotica to highly explicit acts depicting full genital penetration. Yikes. Could this be a major setback for the Sanders campaign? Theres no question that this porn-filled thought bubble has appeared during a critical stage in Sanders campaign, a grassroots effort that has gained national momentum. According to campaign insiders, it looks like the thought bubble and the multi-genre parade of pornography featured inside of it are not going away anytime soon, so Sanders will have to continue his run for office while a cavalcade of sex acts unfold just above his head. While some Americans have balked at the prospect of a presidential candidate who is visibly thinking about an endless array of pornography at all times, many of Sanders supporters have remained loyal and continue to voice their support on social media. Many Sanders supporters have also pointed out that the pornography appearing inside the thought bubble includes people of all races and features a healthy representation of both homosexual and heterosexual intercourse. Such diversity in the porn reaffirms the Vermont senator as the progressive, inclusive politician many voters have come to love. Well see what happens over the next few months, but theres no denying that this pornography-filled thought bubble floating over Bernie Sanders head could be a real game-changer in the campaign! "
0,"In an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press, on Sunday, former Vice-President Dick Cheney told host Chuck Todd that he was sick and tired of Americans being ashamed of our beautiful legacy of torture and that he was organizing the first National Torture-Pride March to take place in Washington in January. This is a chance for all of us torturers to say, Look at us, this is who we are, Cheney, who will be the Grand Marshall of the parade, said. The former Vice-President said that he was organizing the march to inspire the millions of American kids who want to be torturers when they grow up but are afraid theyll catch hell for it. Well be there to say, Were torturers and were damn proud of itjoin us, Cheney said. "
0,"Arizona Governor Jan Brewer said today that she was reluctant to sign an anti-gay religious freedom bill passed by the Arizona state legislature this week, telling reporters, I believe that bigotry and hatred should be free of government regulation. She said that while many Arizona business owners currently enjoy employing hateful practices, I worry that if big government gets involved, thatll ruin everything. Dont get me wrongI think the anti-gay bill that the legislature passed was well-meaning, she said. All Im saying is, lets leave it to the private sector. Offering an example, she added, Look at how Obamacare has messed up health care. Id hate to pass a new law that results in government wrecking bigotry. But Governor Brewer got some pushback today from Republican legislator Harland Dorrinson, who told reporters, Im as opposed to big government as anyone. But promoting hate-based bias is one area where I believe government has an important role to play. For her part, Governor Brewer remains unconvinced by that argument. Noting that the current system of hatred and bigotry in place in Arizona has worked well for decades, she said, If it aint broke, dont fix it. Photograph by Ross D. Franklin/AP. "
0,"President Obama is out of control. Since taking office seven years ago, hes hijacked our government and made an utter mockery of checks on his power. Hes off the rails, and today, the bleak reality is that if he wanted to, our sitting president could probably rob a Home Depot without even getting in trouble. Just consider the following scenario: President Obama heads to his local Home Depot in Arlington, VA, picks up a flatbed cart, and walks up and down the aisles flanked by Secret Service agents, piling his cart high with home-improvement items. Once His Majesty is finally satisfied, he pushes his haul right past the cashier, salutes the security camera, and walks right out the door. And who would be able to stop him? Is there anything standing between the president and Home Depots vast stock of high-quality construction tools and hardware? As unfathomable as it seems, we must face the truth: If the leader of the free world decided to raid one of Home Depots 2,200 national locations, he could likely do so at will, with no fear of punishment. When the Founding Fathers designed the presidency, surely they did not envision this. Surely they did not imagine a tyrant like Obama, who I suspect could point at a random Home Depot on a map, fly there in Air Force One, load hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise into a bulletproof limo without paying, and drive it all back to the White House in broad daylight. And yet here we are. Please, someone tell me, do we even live in a democracy anymore? Would dictatorship not be a more appropriate term for a system in which one man has unilateral power to commandeer thousands of kitchen and household appliances from the Home Depot? If tomorrow we see a topiary sitting proudly in the White House garden with its tag still attached, what could any of us do? Let this serve as a wake-up call. A president who can financially cripple Home Depot without fear of punishment is no president of ours! If and when this robber baron shows up on Home Depots doorstep expecting to rob it blind with no consequences, we will not stand for it. United we stand! "
0,"Congressional Republicans heaped fulsome praise on President Obamas second Inaugural Address today, saying that it had given them a detailed list of things to thwart over the next four years. My big fear was that the speech would be full of vague platitudes that wouldnt be helpful to us in plotting against him, said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Once he started offering details of what he actually hoped to accomplish, though, I realized we had hit the mother lode. Speaker Boehner praised the President for citing such specifics as hiring math and science teachers, building roads, and reducing health-care costs: Now that we know thats what hes got in mind for his second term, we can hit the ground running to stop him. My takeaway from the speech was, if we work hard enough, theres nothing we cant keep him from doing, he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) praised Mr. Obama for injecting humor into a usually somber address: I loved that joke about ending political name-calling. "
0," As President Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address tonight, congressional Republicans are promising to respond with what they call their grumpiest faces ever. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) confirmed that the G.O.P. have been practicing in front of mirrors for weeks in the hopes of creating just the right grouchy-face look for the TV cameras. Tonight, President Obama is going to lay out his vision for this country, he said. We owe it to the American people to look like someone just pissed in our cornflakes. For some, the task of looking crabby is just another day at the office, said Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), widely viewed by his fellow-Republicans as the reigning sourpuss in Congress. Its a gift I have, he said. Its one of the perks of being a steaming cauldron of spite. Perhaps the most sustained performance of sulkiness will fall to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who will be seated behind the President and therefore will be on camera for the entire duration of the address. Theres a lot of pressure on me to look sullen for an entire hour, but Im up to it, he said. It helps that I will be in the same room with so many people I despise. "
0,"Citing budgetary concerns, the United States announced today that it would discontinue regular Saturday drone strikes on U.S. citizens, beginning in 2014. In announcing the decision, the White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that the cutback in drone service was bound to be controversial. In the United States, weve always prided ourselves on our ability to target our citizens with drone strikes, Monday through Saturday, regardless of the weather, he said. We know that losing Saturday drone service is going to take some getting used to. But the move to cut back drone service drew sharp criticism from a longtime defender of the program, the former Vice-President Dick Cheney. Like most Americans, I thought Id never see the day when drones just up and take Saturdays off, he said. This would never be happening if I were still President. As if to silence critics, Mr. Carney assured reporters that drones could still get the job done Monday through Friday, and reminded U.S. citizens to update the government on any change of address so the drones would know where to reach them.

0,"The election of Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) as the Senate Majority Leader was announced on Thursday by a puff of toxic black coal smoke rising from the United States Capitol. Speaking from the well of the Senate, McConnell blasted President Obamas recent climate-change deal with the Chinese, saying that it violated the human rights of carbon. Im not a scientist, he told his colleagues, but Im told that carbon is the basic building block of all life on earth. And that means it should enjoy the same human rights as you and I. Clutching a charcoal briquette in his fist and raising it defiantly over his head, McConnell received a standing ovation from the Republican caucus. Outside the Capitol, McConnell supporters who had been waiting for the symbolic puff of black smoke let out an exuberant cheer, before rubbing their irritated eyes and choking. "
0," The Presidential candidate Donald Trump blasted Pope Francis on Friday, arguing that the Pontiffs recent call to save the planet had largely overshadowed his far more reckless call to feed the poor. Look, if the Pope wants to spout off about climate change, thats his prerogative, I guess, Trump said. But when he starts talking about feeding the poor, that is totally dangerous and irresponsible. Every other candidate is ripping the Popes comments about climate change, he added. Im the only one in this race who seems to have noticed his truly crazy talk about feeding people. Trump said that, as President, it would be his job not to feed the poor but to keep them from getting into the country in the first place. We need to build a wall theyre too hungry to climb, he said. The reality-show host argued that the Pope should stay out of politics, saying, Lets face it, the guy is not rich. Ive been to the Vatican, he said. Its a nice enough place. But would you rather live there, or in a penthouse in Trump Tower? Not even close, my friend. "
0,"By a huge majority, Americans support laws legalizing marijuana and criminalizing Congress, according to a poll released on Thursday. While the poll reflects a relaxation of attitudes about recreational pot use, it also suggests that many Americans now view membership in Congress as a problem ravaging the nation. Harland Dorrinson, an activist who has spent years mobilizing support for the criminalization of Congress, said that this poll reinforces what many of us have been saying for a long time: Congress destroys lives. Ive seen productive members of society get involved with Congress and completely lose the will to work, he said. They just sit there, totally numb and out of touch with reality. He noted that the once prevalent view that membership in Congress was harmless is now being discredited. If you look at what happens to someones brain after ten, twenty, or even thirty years in Congress, its devastating, he said. There is severe impairment. Additionally, he warned that Congress is a gateway elective office that leads many to try running for President. "
0,"Last weeks indictment of Texas Governor Rick Perry has sparked widespread bipartisan support for the concept of sending politicians to prison for ninety-nine years. While Americans are divided about the merits of the specific charges levelled against Perry, there is near-unanimous agreement that imprisoning politicians for ninety-nine years is an idea worth exploring further, a poll released on Monday indicates. According to the poll, eighty-seven per cent of voters from both parties agreed that sending politicians to prison for such a lengthy period would solve a lot of problems and make the country safer. Additionally, when asked to name one politician they would like to see incarcerated for ninety-nine years, voters easily rattled off a dozen or more such candidates, with some voters naming as many as fifty. Finally, when informed that imprisoning politicians for ninety-nine years might lead to overcrowding that would require the construction of costly new prisons, eighty-three per cent agreed with the statement, Money is no object.

One of the most anticipated movies of 2016 now stars someone we thought wed never see onscreen again: According to a press release, Gene Hackman is coming out of retirement for the upcoming Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice to play Supermans reflection when he flies past skyscrapers! So. Awesome. The cast is already loaded with stars like Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, and Jesse Eisenberg, but the addition of Hackman might just be the most exciting development yet. We havent seen the legendary actor since his retirement after 2004s Welcome To Mooseport, and movie fans have been aching for his return to the silver screen ever since. Affleck himself took to Twitter yesterday to talk about the great news: We cant wait! Warner Bros. released a teaser clip where we briefly see Hackman in a building, but we really hope theres an awesome slo-mo shot where Superman stares intently at his reflection because hes deep in thought, and then the camera slowly zooms in on Hackman. That would be incredible! We guess well just have to wait to know for sure! The movie doesnt come out until March 25, and that definitely cant come soon enough. With two Oscar wins to his name, Hackman has already sealed his legacy as one of the all-time acting greats, but his appearance in Batman V Superman will be the icing on the cake. Whether or not he decides to continue his career after this, one things certainly true: Its great to have you back, Gene! "
0,"Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a controversial anti-gay bill last night, telling reporters, Lets focus on discriminating against Mexicans. Governor Brewer said that while the intentions behind this bill were obviously excellent, she was worried that the bill would distract us from our main mission of harassing, tormenting, and otherwise making life miserable for Mexicans. Although Governor Brewer said that she could foresee a time when Arizona might branch out into discriminating against gays, the decision to veto the anti-gay bill in the name of anti-immigrant pride was not difficult: Arizona needs to stick to what it does best.

0,"Republican critics of Obamacare rose up in anger today, claiming that, after two months of fixes, the healthcare.gov Web site is now unacceptably fast. Leading the howls of protest was the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who accused President Obama of designing a Web site that operates at a blistering, breakneck speed. With pages loading in milliseconds, this Web site is insuring people before they know what hit them, Rep. Issa charged. Clearly, this is what the President and his team had in mind. Additionally, Rep. Issa said, at such high speeds it is questionable whether this Web site is even safe for consumers to use, particularly the elderly. The California Republican said he would call for hearings this week to investigate the dangerous new velocity of healthcare.gov, telling reporters, If anyone can slow this thing down, its me. "
0,"Assessing his performance in the aftermath of the second Republican Presidential debate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said he was saddened that he never got a chance to show that he had memorized the three branches of the federal government. If you do all of that homework and nobody even knows that you did it, whats the whole point of doing it in the first place? Walker, who was campaigning in Iowa, said. Id be lying if I said it didnt suck. Walker said he had memorized the three branches in the hopes of dazzling the audience with his knowledge of the inner workings of the federal government, but there just didnt seem to be a good time to get it all in. If Jake Tapper had asked something about the size of the federal government, for example, Walker said, then I would have been like, Its three branches big, Jake. Those branches are: executive, being the President; legislative, being Congress; and judicial, being courts. I wouldve nailed it, he added. Walker acknowledged that he might get another chance to talk about the three branches of government at the next Republican debate, in October, but said that he would probably have to learn them all over again by then.

0,"Flush with victory from yesterdays statewide vote, supporters of North Carolinas Amendment One today moved forward with a bold proposal to ban electricity and soap. Cal Pinckton, a leading proponent of Amendment One who has helped craft the new law, says the principles behind it are simple: If the Bible doesnt mention something, its against the law, and the Bible makes no mention of either soap or electricity. He adds that North Carolina will still have plenty of stuff that the Bible does mention, like boils and locusts. While some critics of the proposed law said that it could be damaging to North Carolinas economy, since it would drive away fanciers of soap and electricity, Mr. Pinckton sees it differently. I think well see a huge boom in tourism, he says. North Carolina is on its way to becoming one great big old-timey theme park, like Colonial Williamsburg. But Mr. Pinckton is careful to emphasize that under the proposed law, there would be certain situations in which the use of electricity would be permitted: You could still use electricity for things that are explicitly mandated by the Bible, like transvaginal ultrasounds.

Twelve-year-old Trevor Gannett invited everyone in his middle school class to attend his birthday party, but none of the kids showed up. His mom posted images of the heartbroken child sitting alone, surrounded by his birthday cake and decorations, and asked people to help cheer him up. The images went viral and caught the attention of the U.S. military, and the very next day, all 1.4 million active-duty service members showed up to celebrate with Trevor! Incredible! Via Giphy.com Yup. Trevor opened his back door to see members from every branch of the armed forces standing in his backyard ready to wish him a happy birthday and eat ice cream cake! Members of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and even the Coast Guard arrived from all corners of the globe, from as nearby as Fort Lee in Virginia to as far away as Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Wow. Faith in humanity restored! From all accounts, Trevor had an absolute blast at his party. The Navy Brass Quintet played Happy Birthday, and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter gifted him his very own Army Strong T-shirt. And after Trevor blew out the candles, he got a special treat: a flyover by 1,200 fighter jets100 for every year hes been alive! Looks like the greatest army in the world is also the kindest army.

0," An organization of University of North Carolina athletic boosters expressed shock and outrage today over a report that a few members of U.N.C. sports teams may have taken real classes, despite the widespread availability of fake ones. The report, which alleges that several players may have fulfilled the curriculum requirements of actual classes, sent shock waves through the U.N.C. booster community. These players apparently attended classes, wrote papers, and took exams, Hal Cowlington, the president of a prominent U.N.C. booster club, said. The impact of these distractions on their athletic performance is, to put it mildly, incalculable. A spokesman for the university was quick to say that the cases of athletes taking real classes appeared to be isolated incidents, but promised that U.N.C. would press forward with a full investigation of the matter. As a university, it is our sacred duty to protect our athletes from education, the university spokesman said. We canand we mustdo better. "

0,"Moments after its conclusion on Sunday night, President Obamas speech about combating ISIS came under heavy criticism from people with zero better ideas. The Presidents proposals, ranging from coalition air strikes against ISIS to beefing up intelligence about potential terrorists, were blasted for being nothing new, with the harshest criticism coming from people with nothing new. I was incredibly frustrated hearing the President say he would destroy ISIS, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie told CNN. ISIS needs to be obliterated. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz shared Christies scathing assessment of Obamas speech. The President seems to think that ISIS will go away just by us bombing them, Cruz said. If I am President, I will bomb them so hard that will feel like they have been triple-bombed. Calling it too little, too late, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ripped the Presidents proposal for keeping potential terrorists from obtaining visas. We need to stop them before they even obtain the pens necessary to fill out visa forms, he said. Of all of the Republican Presidential candidates, the front-runner Donald Trump was perhaps the most withering in his criticism of the Presidents speech. I only heard the President use the word tough once, Trump said. I gave a speech last night and used it fifteen times. Pressed for specifics about how he would combat ISIS, Trump acknowledged that he had no new ideas, but added, My no new ideas will be much tougher than his no new ideas, you better believe it. "

During a press junket for her upcoming film, Our Brand Is Crisis, one entertainment reporter asked the actress to give him a haircut, and she informed him just how rude that question was. Check out her perfect response: Interviewer: Will you please cut my hair? Bullock: I wouldnt know where to begin.

Via Giphy.com You said it, Sandra! Hopefully, this will teach the media that its not okay to ask actresses for a trim. They are talented performers there to answer questions about their movie, not to serve as your own personal hairstylist. Ask them about how they prepared for the role, or talk about the films plot. Dont tell them to shorten your bangs or fix your sideburns. And the next time an interviewer thinks he can get away with telling an actress to clean up his neckline, Sandra set a good example of how to respond to ignorance. Mic freaking dropped. "

Putin spent over six hours consulting with his inner circle of imaginary friends, whom he refers to as the League of Superior Beings. Attending the meeting were Igor, a powerful brute who can deflect missiles with his bare fists; Dr. Karamazov, who can control the worlds weather; and Ludmila, a sorceress whose powers include the ability to bend time and transform herself into a number of animals and insects. Putin emerged from the meeting energized and upbeat, telling associates that Igor and Ludmila had put aside their usual rivalry to confront the threat of sanctions.

0,"Republicans, who mercilessly mocked Barack Obamas lack of government experience before he became President, now favor Presidential candidates with no experience whatsoever, the head of the Republican National Committee has confirmed. The R.N.C. chief, Reince Priebus, said that he sees no contradiction at all between Republicans contempt for Obamas pre-White House rsum, which included eleven years spent in public office, and their rabid enthusiasm for G.O.P. rising stars Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina, whose combined years in public office total zero. I think what bothered us Republicans the most about Obama was that he was a community organizer, Priebus explained. What does organizing people have to do with running a government? In contrast with that dubious credential, he said, Carson is eminently qualified to be President because of his experience as a neurosurgeon. I think if Ben had negotiated with the Iranians we would have gotten a better deal, because he would have known how their brains worked, medically and all, Priebus argued. Additionally, the R.N.C. boss said that the billionaire Donald Trumps experience puts him leagues ahead of President Obama. One of President Obamas problems is that he is out of touch with reality, Priebus said. Donald Trump spent fourteen seasons hosting a reality show. As for the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina, Priebus said that the excitement her rsum is generating among the Republican faithful is totally understandable. Like a lot of Republicans, Id love to see Carly take on ISIS, he said. Shes shown she can destroy a large organization. Watch: Mary Norris explains the semicolon. "

As for the rest of the G.O.P. field, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum suspended his campaign this week, saying that he wanted to spend more time with the voices in my head. And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote a five-hundred-dollar check on an account that had no money in it, in the first sign that he might be qualified to be President. Elsewhere, a Fox News spokesman blasted a mole who had previously worked for the network: At Fox News we have zero tolerance for someone who tells the truth. "

The House panel that mandated the office-supply freeze denied that it was politically motivated, citing budgetary concerns. Its time President Obama learned a tough lesson, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters. Being President does not entitle you to a spending spree at Staples. At the White House, the President blasted the Republicans move to strip him of legal pads, pencils, and other office essentials, calling it just their latest attempt to keep me from doing my job. In an Oval Office appearance, a visibly irritated President Obama showed reporters a nearly empty supply cabinet and said, They have manufactured this crisis, noting that he will be out of paper clips and Post-its by August.

Its mystifying, said one investigator working on the case. One theory were considering is that people who spend time on Twitter eventually lose their capacity for critical thinking and become sheep. The Syrian Electronic Army, the group of hackers who claimed responsibility for yesterdays hoax, said that they were flabbergasted that it created such chaos: Honestly, we didnt think anyone would believe it, what with it being on Twitter and all. At Twitter headquarters, a company spokesman said that yesterdays incident, which briefly caused the Dow to plunge a hundred points and temporarily wiped off a hundred thirty-six billion dollars of value from the S.&P. 500, was testament to the amazing growth of Twitter. In a few short years, Twitter has evolved from a mere waste of time into a force capable of massive havoc and destruction, the Twitter spokesman said. Were excited to see what Twitter does next. "

The rebranded network, to dbut nationwide on Monday, will be called CNN Classic. Breaking news is hard, said the newly installed CNN chief, Jeff Zucker. You have to talk to sources, make sure their stories check out O.K., and then get on the air and not say anything stupid. I, for one, am thrilled to be getting out of that horrible business. CNN Classic will begin its broadcast day on Monday, Mr. Zucker said, with round-the-clock coverage of Operation Desert Storm. Mr. Zucker did not indicate what impact the new format would have on such CNN stars as Wolf Blitzer, saying only, I cant promise that Wolf will be a part of CNNs future, but he will continue to be a big part of our past. The CNN chief scoffed at reports that other cable news outlets had eclipsed his network once and for all, throwing down this gauntlet: We are going to win May sweeps with Hurricane Katrina. "

Speaking from an undisclosed location in Russia, Mr. Snowden said he hacked the Web site over the weekend and thinks he is pretty sure what the problem is. Look, this thing was built terribly, he said. Its a government Web site, O.K.? Mr. Snowden said that if an immunity deal can be worked out, I can get to work on this thing right awayI dont need a password. In addition to full immunity, Mr. Snowden said he is requesting that he be allowed to work from home. At the White House, President Obama offered a muted response to Mr. Snowdens proposal: Edward Snowden is a traitor who has compromised our national security.

Fox News president Roger Ailes explained the timing of the shutdown, which will be the first in the history of the network: We wanted to pick a time when we were positive nothing would be happening that our viewers would want to see. Mr. Ailes said that Fox had considered shutting down only once before, exactly four years earlier on January 20, 2009, and later regretted the decision to continue broadcasting that day: It turned out that no Fox viewers wanted to watch TV that day. And I mean none. According to Mr. Ailes, for the twelve hours Fox News is off the air on Monday the network will broadcast a continuous photomontage of white people. Regular viewers of Fox probably wont notice anything unusual, he said. After the routine maintenance is completed, Mr. Ailes said, Fox News will return to the air Tuesday morning with its regular broadcast schedule: For Fox viewers, it will be like Monday never happened.

Alistair Strott, a journalist and one of Georges most outspoken critics, calls the Princes first year long on hype and short on solid achievement. Like a lot of us, I followed the royal birth last year with a great deal of excitement and anticipation, says Strott. But one year in, we all have to look at each other and say, Thats it? While defenders of Prince George cite a packed schedule of events during his first year, Strott is unimpressed. Yes, hes been on TV and magazine covers, he says. So have the Kardashians. The journalist is not alone in criticizing Prince George, as a recent U.K. poll called his inaugural year the worst first year for a royal baby since the Second World War. Strott acknowledged that George had spent much of his first year in office learning to walk, but added, If hes learned to talk, he certainly hasnt said anything memorable. On most of the major issues facing Britain today, from unemployment to its relationship with the European Union, George has been missing in action, Strott says. Buckingham Palace has already started the drumbeat of publicity for Prince Georges second year, but Strott remains skeptical. People can call this child royal if they like, but the word Id choose is overrated, he says. "
0,"Howls of protest filled the halls of the U.S. Senate today as dozens of Senators expressed their outrage at having to work through the weekend to save the United States from financial Armageddon. Were hearing a lot about the country plunging back into recession and millions of people being thrown out of work, said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). What were not hearing much about is how our Sunday is being completely and irrevocably ruined. Senator McConnell said that when President Obama called the Senate back to work on a budget deal this weekend, At first I thought he was kidding. Not only have I never worked on a weekend, Ive never met anyone whos done such a damn fool thing. The Senate Minority Leader added that if saving this country means working Saturday and Sunday, then Im not sure this is a country worth saving. Yes, I know that the fiscal cliff is a ticking time bomb that could destroy the U.S. economy for years to come and take the rest of the world with it, he said. I also know that Sunday is Week seventeen of the N.F.L. season and now Im missing all my games. Mr. McConnell said that while saving the nation may be important to be some people, he worries that forcing the Senate to work on a weekend is setting a dangerous precedent. For years, people have run for Congress because they knew that serving here was synonymous with not working, he said. If thats going to change all of a sudden, a lot of us are going to feel very betrayed. "
0,"The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is hoping to jump-start his lagging Presidential campaign with a new television ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history, campaign aides confirm. With the crucial New Hampshire primary just hours away, the Bush campaign believes it can finish strong by reminding voters of Jebs connection to a man who left the nation in smoldering ruins. In the ad, which Bush aides are calling a fantastic closing argument, Jebs ability to keep the United States safe and create peace around the world is praised by the President, whose decisions helped destabilize the Middle East and give rise to ISIS. Across the state, the ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history is making a powerful impression on voters. It brought back a lot of memories, Carol Foyler, who lost her house in 2007, said. With the ad scheduled to air around the clock until primary day, aides to Bush are hoping that the commercial, persuasive as it is, is not too little, too late.

0,"Eager to shore up their pro-life credentials, several Republican Presidential candidates used campaign appearances on Wednesday to assert that the babies of undocumented workers have the right to be born and then immediately deported. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee sounded that theme in a campaign appearance in Des Moines, telling his audience, We must vigilantly safeguard the life of the unborn, and, as soon it is no longer unborn, make sure that it leaves and takes its illegal parents with it. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker concurred, telling a crowd in Iowa City, Every life is precious, and we must protect that life before marching it to the border twenty-four hours later, at the very most. Perhaps the most evangelical invocation of the right to life came from Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), campaigning in Cedar Rapids. Every baby is a creation of God Almighty, and as Jesus is my savior, every baby has the right to live, he said. Just not here. The initial response to the candidates statements was somewhat mixed, with some G.O.P. voters complaining that Walkers twenty-four-hour window for deporting babies was overly lenient.

0,"Scandal rocked Bernie Sanderss Presidential campaign on Friday as the candidate was forced to admit that he received free checking from several big banks. In a press conference in Manchester, New Hampshire, a chastened Sanders acknowledged that, over the past two decades, he received free checking from Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase in exchange for maintaining a five-hundred-dollar minimum balance. I should have acknowledged my relationship with these banks earlier, a subdued Sanders told reporters. For that, I am sorry. The Clinton campaign immediately seized on the revelation, with one senior Clinton aide alleging that Sanderss cozy relationship with the banks effectively strips him of the label progressive. Quite frankly, I dont know of too many progressives who make five-hundred-dollar payoffs to the big banks, the aide said. This doesnt pass the smell test. The news of Sanderss ties to the banking industry comes just days after damaging reports that he leveraged his relationship with the American Automobile Association to obtain a discount on renting a Nissan Sentra.

Even as he apologized, Mr. Cook downplayed the number of Apple customers affected by the Maps glitch: This only impacts Apple customers who have someplace to go. From what we can tell, most of our customers just go back and forth to the Apple Store and thats pretty much it.

0,"Stung by defeat in Saturdays South Carolina primary, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is considering a bold strategy to reboot his Presidential campaign: engaging in a high-profile extramarital affair. At a press conference in Charleston, Mr. Romney confirmed that he was consulting with senior advisers about the best way to proceed with an inappropriate relationship. Republican voters have sent the message that they want to vote for an adulterous scumbag, and I have heard them loud and clear, he said. I promise that I will engage in a world-class extramarital affair that will make all of us proud again. According to one senior adviser, the Romney campaign was already holding focus groups and conducting special polling to determine the best person with whom Mr. Romney should conduct his extracurricular dalliance. And, in a sign that Mr. Romney is taking precipitous action to find an object for his adulterous intentions, today his campaign launched a new dating site, SexyTimeWithMitt.com. But according to one female visitor to the site, Mr. Romneys nascent career as a would-be lothario is still very much a work in progress: He listed his status as Its complicated, but then I read a little further and realized he was talking about his taxes. Elsewhere, an exultant Newt Gingrich made the following victory statement: Ive left Mitt Romney behind faster than a woman with cancer. "

Pot roast, meatloaf, duck a lorangeas long as its piping hot and on the table when her husband comes home, I dont care what a gal makes, he told supporters. Mr. Romney also unveiled his latest immigration proposal, which would allow immigrants to become citizens by going to fight in Iran.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the first library opened by Mr. Bush, located in Guantnamo, Cuba, celebrated its eleventh anniversary in January with considerably less pomp. And for Harland Dorrinson, who curates Mr. Bushs other library, the lack of attention stings. Were actually the first George W. Bush library, if anybody cares to know, Mr. Dorrinson said, adding that no media whatsoever covered the Guantnamo librarys eleventh anniversary. They say that millions of people are going to visit the George W. Bush Library in Dallas every year, he said. On a good day, were lucky if we see one or two C.I.A. guys in between interrogations, looking for a Tom Clancy novel. While Mr. Dorrinson said that he doesnt expect his library to get the kind of attention likely to be enjoyed by its fancier counterpart in Dallas any time soon, he calls the absence of recognition hurtful. It seems like there was a lot of excitement about this place when we opened in 2002, he said. When was the last time you heard anyone in Washington even say the word Guantnamo? Thats a shame, he added, because the library at Guantnamo has a lot to offer that the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas doesnt: If you go to their Web site, you see that theyre closed some days. Were going to be open forever. "
0,"President Obamas proposal to give workers six weeks of paid leave is meeting strong opposition from a group of people who annually receive thirty-three weeks of paid leave. Members of the group heard the Presidents proposal on Tuesday night, one of the few nights of the year when they are required to report to their workplace. The opponents of paid leave, who show up for work a hundred and thirty-seven days per year and receive paid leave for the other two hundred and twenty-eight, were baffled by other moments in the Presidents speech. For example, they were confused by Obamas challenge to try to survive on a full-time job that pays fifteen thousand dollars, since they all currently hold a part-time job that pays a hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars.

0,"In what he called a provocative and defiant act, President Obama charged on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has started letting his calls go directly to voice mail. Speaking at the White House before this weeks NATO summit, a visibly furious Obama said that Putins new practice of letting his calls go straight to voice mail hampers our ability to discuss the future of Ukraine and other important issues going forward. Having left dozens of voice mails for the Russian President, Obama said that he tried to reach him via e-mail on Monday night but received an out-of-office auto reply. Given what he has been up to in Ukraine over the past few weeks, I find it impossible believe he has been out of the office, Obama said. The President hinted that Putins failure to respond to his voice mails could result in additional sanctions and signaled that he did not intend to call the Russian President again. I have left my last voice mail for him, he said, adding that the last time he called Putin his mailbox was full. "
0,"Saying that they needed to be in peak physical condition for their looming effort to defund Obamacare, over a hundred House Republicans lined up for their free annual physicals today. The physicals, part of Congresss government-subsidized health-care package, yielded good news for many of the House G.O.P., who learned that they were strong and healthy enough for the demanding task of defunding Obamacare. My blood pressure was lower than I thought it would be, said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Thats amazing, because it goes through the roof whenever I think about how Obamacare would destroy America. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia)whose free annual physical included an examination of his heart, lungs, ears, eyes, throat, and bloodsaid that his doctor proclaimed him in perfect physical condition: He said I should be able to live a long, healthy life and defund Obamacare for many years to come. Rep. Cantor added that he had lost a few pounds since last years free annual physical, as he headed to lunch before defunding food stamps. "

The American people dont want to hear personal attacks, Carson told reporters. They want to know which candidate has the best plan for locating Atlantis and recovering its storied treasures. Carson said that finding Atlantis was central to his plan for reviving the U.S. economy. We could start paying down the national debt with one jewel-encrusted trident, he said.

After exploring a number of options, we decided that moving to the seventeenth century would cause the least disruption, he said. Were not going to have to change a thing. Mr. Dorrinson added that despite recent controversy involving the U.S. Senate candidate Representative Todd Akin (R., Miss.), there would be no modification of the Partys official platform: After we ban abortion in cases of rape and incest, were going to focus on Americas spiralling witch problem.

0,"After years of being subjected to unfair ridicule, former President George W. Bush is now enjoying his newfound status as the smarter of the two Bush brothers to have achieved elected office. Speaking to reporters at his home in Dallas, Bush said he was deriving quiet satisfaction from a new poll showing that ninety-one per cent of the American people now consider him the smarter Bush. I know that no ones saying Im a genius, he said, modestly. But I look pretty good when Im graded on a curve. Bush pointed with particular pride to the fact that seventy-four per cent of those polled said that, of the two Bush brothers, he had a far superior command of the English language. When I was President, I got a lot of grief from people who didnt think my English was too good, he said. I think now theyre realizing it could have been worser. The former President said that he hoped the American peoples view of him as the smarter Bush would soon be shared by his parents, George and Barbara Bush. At Thanksgiving, Mom and Dad would never let me carve the turkey because they thought Id screw it up somehow, he said. Something tells me Ill be carving that turkey this year. "

At a press conference in Trenton, Christie yelled at a room full of reporters, accusing them of doing the public a disservice by not devoting all of their coverage of him to the issue of his body mass. How much Ive weighed in the past, how much I weigh now, and how much Im eatingthats all you clowns should be writing about, he yelled. Anything else is just a distraction. Adopting a threatening tone, Christie told the reporters, If you know whats good for you, your next story will be about how tubby I am.

0,"On the opening night of the 2012 Republican National Convention, the Presidential nominee Mitt Romney received fulsome praise for being a regular, down-to-earth guy from his wife, Ann, whose dressage horse, Rafalca, competed in the London Olympics. Mitt has never let his success go to his head, Mrs. Romney said. Take away the seven-thousand-square-foot house in La Jolla and the bank account in the Caymans, hes still the same fun-loving boy who pinned a gay kid to the ground and cut off his hair. Mrs. Romney adopted an intimate tone as she attempted to describe the Mitt only I know. Every now and then, Mitt will give me this devilish smile of his, and I know that can only mean one thing, she said, flushing slightly. He just fired someone. In a small flub that many delegates found endearing, Mrs. Romney said, Mitt Romney is like you or mehe puts his pants on one leg at a time. Oh, wait. He has a fellow who does that for him. My bad. But the nominees wife brought the convention audience to its feet with her closing endorsement of her husband: I promise you that if you elect Mitt President of the United States, he will never give less than thirteen per cent.

0,"As North Korea ramped up its threats to attack South Korea, CNN reassured its viewers that a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula would have no effect whatsoever on its Whitney Houston coverage. As viewers, you have come to trust us to deliver the news whenever it happens, wherever it happens, as long as that news is about Whitney Houston, said Wolf Blitzer, host of the networks Situation Room program. We will never do anything to break that trust. As Mr. Blitzer spoke, twenty-three of The Situation Room s twenty-four video monitors featured images of Ms. Houston, with the twenty-fourth featuring an image of her ex, Bobby Brown. The news from CNN sent a chill through the senior leadership of North Korea, who announced later today that it might postpone a nuclear war until later in the week, when the Whitney Houston coverage calms down. Good luck with that, Mr. Blitzer said. The Oscars are this Sunday. Meanwhile, in what some political insiders are calling a sign of desperation, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney today had his first name legally changed to Not. And a new study showed that the election of former Senator Rick Santorum would solve the U.S.s immigration problems but create enormous ones for Canada. "
0,"On July 1, recreational marijuana use was legalized in the state of Oregon. Stoners and casual users alike rejoiced at the news, and some even took to the streets, lighting up publicly in celebration. For supporters of legalization, this represented a major victory. But the battle may not be over just yet. Thats because, over at 1223 Marshall Street in the mid-size suburb of Beaverton, marijuana is still illegal. Thats right, Oregonians. Under Jim Michaelsons roof, youre in a pot-free zone. While Oregon law may allow you to have up to eight ounces of marijuana per household, Jim and Eileen Michaelson still have a zero-tolerance policy. This strict guideline is in effect even if its kept out of view or if youre able to get rid of the smell. In fact, sneaking around behind Jims back might even be worse than just doing it right in front of him. It doesnt matter whether the president or the queen of Timbuktu herself said pot is legal, read a statement from Jim Michaelson. When you step inside the Michaelson household, marijuana is absolutely not allowed. Yup. But not all hope is lost. Sources recently overheard Eileen Michaelson saying that medical marijuana could maybe be valuable, as long as its not being abused. Still, it seems like Jims most recent public comment reaffirmed that in his house, hes the mayor, and theres no room for any ifs, ands, or buts on the matter. So for now, it seems like anyone caught with marijuana in the Michaelson home will suffer some major consequences. And that goes for everyone. "

With international crises boiling over in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine, its unconscionable that the President is having breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he said. The White House defended the Presidents eating habits, noting that his predecessor, George W.

It sends a very dangerous message to our enemies to see President Obama eating, he said. "
0,"Ever since the Cleveland Cavaliers lost in the NBA Finals last summer, people have been wondering how Cavs superstar LeBron James would prepare himself for another long season ahead. Given what he said to the press after practice yesterday, the rest of the league should be very scared. I spent the whole summer thinking about jumping, said James when asked about his offseason. Pretty much every moment I was awake I thought about jumping, and I had many dreams about it too. Were going to have a great season, and I am also thinking about jumping right now. Wow. Many already thought the Cavaliers would be difficult to beat this season, but with the news that their best player dedicated his entire offseason to thinking about jumping, they might just be unstoppable. Unsurprisingly, Cavs fans are very excited. Some social media sleuthing revealed that LeBron had already dropped a few hints about his offseason regimen.

0,"Growing up, Ryan Thorley didnt realize anything was wrong. He was happy, he got good grades in school, and he fit in well with his peerswhat else could a boy want? But little did he know that his brain wasnt functioning as it should. When he looked at the Disney logo, for some strange reason, he would always see the D as a G. I didnt realize it until I was in college, said the now 27-year-old. I looked at the logo and thought, Wait, Disney begins with a D. So why does it look like a G to me? Alarmed, he went to nearly a dozen different neurologists seeking answers and treatment, but none were able to offer any assistance. Running out of options and growing increasingly desperate, Thorley reached out to Dr. Alain Desjardins, a Johns Hopkins neurologist widely renowned for developing numerous groundbreaking brain treatments. The moment I heard about Ryans issue, I knew it was going to require radical surgical intervention, said Desjardins. For him to perceive what was very clearly a D as a G was indicative of severe abnormalities in the neural pathways and structural anatomy. Using a litany of cutting-edge navigational imaging techniques, Desjardins was able to identify deformities in portions of the frontal lobe and angular gyrus as the sources of Thorleys problem. Unfortunately, there were no existing surgical solutions that could reliably correct the issue. However, if Thorley consented, Desjardins was willing to make him the pilot patient for an invasive experimental procedure that, if flawlessly executed, could effectively erase the problem. They told me up-front that the surgery came with a 30 to 40 percent chance of fatality, and I really didnt know if I was comfortable taking that risk, Thorley said. But, ultimately, I realized that if I ever wanted normalcy in my life, then it was necessary for me to take this leap of faith. Over the course of an intense 21-hour procedure, Desjardins and his team removed large portions of Thorleys brain and replaced them with seven state-of-the-art electromagnetic implants. Thorley survived the surgery, but it would take at least six months of grueling recovery before the brain implants could be activated and doctors could determine whether the procedure had been a success. After months of brutal rehabilitation marked by constant, blinding pain, Thorley was finally ready for the moment of truth. Using a device that vaguely resembled a Wii remote, Desjardins activated the brain implants one by one, each time sending a violent jolt of electricity throughout Thorleys body. Then, following a three-day acclimation period, Thorley was shown the Disney logo. And he saw a D. It was the happiest moment of my life, Thorley said. I finally felt like everything was going to be okay. Though the surgery produced some lasting side effectsThorley will never again be able to grow hair on the right side of his head, and incidental paralysis of facial nerves has left him with a permanently slack expressionthe downsides are vastly outweighed by the promise of a bright future. As long as Thorley continues to go in for the weekly electroshock treatments that are necessary to keep the brain implants operating, hell never see the D in the Disney logo as a G again.

The N.A.A., whose stated mission is to enhance the randomness, disorder, and confusion of American life, called the new list of approved items just what the doctor ordered. We love that the list appears to have been put together with no organizing principle or logical system, said N.A.A. executive director Carol Foyler. It combines the virtues of making no sense and being impossible to remember. Knives, bats, golf clubs, billiard cuesits like they made this list using refrigerator-poetry magnets. Ms. Foylers only criticism of the list, she said, was that she would have replaced billiard cues with fencing foils. That would have been even more random, in my opinion. On the whole, though, she called the list very solid, from an arbitrariness point of viewespecially when you consider that they are still banning bottled water. John S. Pistole, the administrator of the T.S.A., denied that the list of approved items was arbitrary, telling reporters, This agency is committed to redoubling our efforts in the war on water. Mr. Pistole said that thanks to the ban on bottled water, the T.S.A. had foiled over seven hundred Evian-based terror plots last year alone. "
0,"Okay, so this proves that the future really is happening now. What was once just a dream for environmentalists is finally becoming a reality: Researchers have just developed a lab-grown bone thats perfect for sucking clean, and its totally changing the way humanity thinks about food. Science FTW! After 15 years of hard work and $40 million in private investments, a group of professors at the University of Florida have created a bone that is perfect for picking up off the plate and sucking dry. The artificially calcified substitute can be grown in a petri dish, and the result is flavorful and smooth, with only a few chunks of gristle attached. No excess meat; no chewy tendons. It takes just a few weeks for the cells to multiply, and then youve got a delicious treat that may be the next big step in slowing down global warming. The upsides for lab-grown bones are seemingly endless: They require roughly 1/30th of the land used to create traditional bones, the methane emissions are nearly 50 times less, and, of course, these amazing advancements may one day spare the lives of billions of animals. Still not convinced? The lucky few who have already gnawed on the stringy sinews attached to the lab-grown bone say they cant even tell the difference between that and slurping marrow out of the real thing. Seriously, how cool is that? This is incredible news for anyone who loves the environment but also loves scooping out a nice, wet hunk of cartilage, or wants to lick off extra sauce or fat. The researchers also advised that the lab-grown bones can be used to make delicious soup stock. Wow. That sure sounds like the future to us! Hopefully, someday soon it wont just be scientists with this technology, and everyone will be able to go to the store, buy a lab-grown bone, and go to town on it until its completely clean. "

In interviews across the state, Wisconsinites expressed emotions ranging from dread to panic as they grappled with the realization that Walker would soon be back behind his desk performing his duties. Earlier this spring, when he was riding high in the polls, a lot of my friends and I were thinking, This is the break weve been looking for, said Carol Foyler of Green Bay. We definitely had our hopes up. Tracy Klugian of Milwaukee agreed. I dont know a person in Wisconsin who wasnt pumped about the idea of Scott Walker going to Washington, he said. And then we watched that first debate. He shuddered at the memory. In the hours after the governors stunning announcement, on Monday, Wisconsinites formed support groups to help each other navigate the reality of Walker turning his full attention to their state. At a meeting of one of the groups on Tuesday evening, Kenosha resident Harland Dorrinson expressed confidence that his fellow Wisconsinites would be able to contend with their new situation.

0,"Uh-oh. Looks like legendary director Martin Scorsese got himself into a bit of trouble. According to reports, the 73-year-old filmmaker was ejected from an upscale Los Angeles restaurant last night after getting every customer in the establishment to start chanting Gangs of New York! over and over again as loudly as they could. Talk about a total meltdown! Those who witnessed the scene reported that Scorseses disruptive behavior began when he was eating alone at a trendy spot in West Hollywood and started quietly chanting the title of his 2002 feature film, Gangs Of New York, to himself repeatedly. Soon after, according to restaurant staff, the Academy Awardwinning director began banging his fork and knife on the table in rhythm with his chanting, while his cries of Gangs of New York! Gangs of New York! gradually grew louder and louder. After a few moments, the family seated next to Scorsese reportedly began chanting Gangs of New York! Gangs of New York! along with him. The chant spread throughout the restaurant, and within minutes, every single patron at the L.A. hotspot was screaming Gangs of New York! over and over again in unison. Sources say that after several hours of continuous chanting, the restaurant patrons began to get unruly. Dozens of customers were smashing plates and flipping tables, all while furiously shrieking Gangs of New York! in an unbroken rhythm as Martin Scorsese urged them to chant louder and louder. Eventually, the restaurants manager had no choice but to call the police, who escorted the beloved director outside. Paparazzi who were on hand to witness the directors unbridled chanting fit have reported that Scorsese continued to scream Gangs of New York! as police dragged him from the premises. Yikes! Looks like Martin Scorsese has let fame get to his head. Hey, Marty, maybe next time think twice before you get a whole room full of people to start incessantly screaming the title of one of your movies.

After a lifetime of begging, 83-year-old Pulitzer Prizewinning author Philip Roths dream has finally come true: He got to drive a golf cart. Absolutely wonderful! The celebrated author has publicly asked for the chance to drive a golf cart again and again throughout his decades-long career, mentioning golf carts in nearly every interview hes ever given. Fellow novelist John Updike famously said of Roth, Ive never had a conversation with Philip that he did not try to turn toward golf carts. The man really looks forward to one day driving one, and he lets you know it. Roths semi-autobiographical novels often feature protagonists for whomdespite a strong desire to do sodriving a golf cart remains just out of reach. Roth has made it no secret that the golf cartdriving ambitions of Nathan Zuckerman, the protagonist of many of his books, are very much based on his own. In this passage from The Human Stain, narrator Zuckerman attempts to drive a golf cart: On the path in front of me was parked a golf cart with a man seated in it. I thought of how Id love to strap myself into the cockpit and grip the handlebars, pushing them forward to drive the golf cart onward. Hello? I called out. A gruff voice responded, What? Sir, I was admiring your golf cart. You dont suppose I could drive... I started to say, only to be cut off by the sound of the cart beginning to drive away. The gruff voice called back with a cruel laugh, Never. Well, after all his years of begging, Philip Roth finally got his wish. Last week, while visiting a friend, Roth noticed a golf cart in the garage and begged to be allowed to drive it. He was overjoyed when his friend said yes, and he took it out for a spin. Although a low battery meant he could only drive the cart about 40 yards before it died, he was finally able to satisfy his lifelong urge. Were so happy for you, Philip Roth! "
0,"The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday night that he was tremendously relieved that the recent controversy linking him to the Ku Klux Klan had apparently not hurt him with voters in Alabama. Im not a worrier by nature, but I must admit I was worried about this, Trump told reporters. The minute that that K.K.K. business started up, my main fear was, I sure hope this doesnt upset voters in Alabama. After the Alabama returns came in showing him romping to an easy victory in the Yellowhammer State, Trump said, I sighed a huge sigh of relief. Trump pointed to exit polls showing that ninety-seven per cent of Alabamans who voted for him were aware that he had been praised by the former K.K.K. leader David Duke and voted for me anyway. The fact that they knew I was endorsed by the K.K.K. but were able to look beyond it says something great about them, he said. I guess I was worried about nothing. "
0,"While heads of state debate how to handle the surge of Syrian refugees fleeing for their lives, ISIS continues its relentless campaign of violence and terror. Its most recent strike is a big one: This morning, U.S. military officials were stunned to discover that the Islamic terrorist group had placed the Pentagon up for auction on eBay. Disgusting. Initially set at $1,500, the price of the Pentagon quickly rose, rocketing past $7,000 in the first hour of open bidding. Troublingly, the White Houses attempts to outbid the competition $500 at a time have been continually thwarted as eBay users the world over escalate the situation. With two days still to go and no Buy It Now option, its anyones guess as to how high the bids could climb. As it is both the headquarters of the Department of Defense and a symbol of Americas military power, losing the Pentagon would be an absolutely devastating blow to the United States on many levels. Still, the White House has remained resolute in the wake of the attack, releasing the following statement earlier today: We condemn the attempted sale of the Pentagon as a despicable act of aggression against the United States. It will not go unanswered. America has never faltered in the face of extremism, and today is no exception. Please do not bid on the Pentagon. Time and again, ISIS has demonstrated that its cruelty is only rivaled by its ingenuity and adaptability. Even if the U.S. weathers this crisis, the next assault cant be far behind. "
0,"The landing of the Mars science rover Curiosity does not qualify as a significant scientific achievement and should not be getting so much of the publics attention, says the team of scientists who discovered the Higgs boson last month. People see these beautiful pictures from outer space and theyre inclined to think that something amazing has been achieved, a spokesperson for the Higgs-boson team said. Let the Mars rover do something of genuine value, like, say, discover how the universe was created. Then Ill be impressed. As for the NASA scientists behind the Mars rover, the Higgs-boson spokesman said, I dont think we should be too quick to use the word scientist here. Honestly, anyone can grow a Mohawk and put on a headset and look cool and all, but that hardly makes you a scientist. Lets see some of these dudes discover a particle or something along those lines. I mean, come on. From the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, response to the Higgs-boson teams comments was swift and irate, as a NASA spokesman called the remarks an unacceptable diss. You know the difference between the Mars rover and the Higgs boson? said a NASA spokesman, his face red with anger. You can actually see the Mars rover. The NASA official went on to say that I can understand why the Higgs people think they found something thats real and all, but as far as I can tell their so-called boson is about as real as a leprechaun or a Smurf. In Geneva, the Higgs team was quick to fire back a response: At the Large Hadron Collider lab, were used to honest disagreements between scientists. But wed like to see that douche come over here and say that to our face. "
0,"Lashing out at what he called the Soviet-style tactics of the indictments against him, Texas Governor Rick Perry said on Tuesday that the government had grossly overstepped its traditional role of mandating transvaginal ultrasounds. Speaking to supporters in Austin, Perry blasted the indictments and called for a return to an era of limited government that focusses on requiring gynecological procedures. We are living in dark days indeed when the state of Texas is spending time and money probing its officials instead of its women, he said, to thunderous applause. "
0,"Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney dropped by the selfnews today and gave what some are calling his most candid interview ever: Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge of your campaign going forward? A: Well, I suppose the biggest challenge would be the same one Ive faced all my life: that no one likes me. But as Ive found in the past, money usually takes care of that. Q: What do you need to do to persuade the right wing of your party that youre one of them? A: Well, first and foremost, I have to do a better job of convincing them that I believe in the crazy things they do. The problem is, the media keeps emphasizing aspects of my rsum that make me sound sane, like when I gave people in Massachusetts health care. Talk about something Id like to have a Mulligan on! Now, theres stuff in my biography that would help me with the Republican baselike the time in prep school when I pinned that gay boy to the ground and cut his hair offbut that gets little if any coverage. This is a clear case of media bias, and I wish it would stop. Q: How are you working to change the perception that youre sane? A: Well, obviously, by saying stuff that makes me sound like Im off my rocker. Sheldon Adelson has been super helpful with this. If I could just channel that guy, Id be ready for the booby hatch! I mean, you want to talk about a few bricks shy of a load. [Makes circular motion by the side of his head.] Anyway, hes given me some of my best lines for my stump speech. Like the one about how on Day One Im going to move Obamacare and Planned Parenthood to Iran and then bomb the hell out of all three. Thats pure Sheldon. Q: Speaking of your stump speech, recently youve been talking about how President Obama has fostered a culture of dependency. Whats the impetus behind that? A: Oh, thats to appeal to voters who dont like black people. I thought that was obvious! Laughing Out Loud. Well, Im afraid thats all I have time for. I have to take some of the old Bain gang out for dinner and make sure we keep our stories straight about when I worked there. "
0,"Earlier this month, a team of researchers from Britains Southampton University unearthed a previously undiscovered ancient Roman settlement containing a library of scrolls that provide incredible insight into what life was like for Roman citizens 2,000 years ago. Here are some of the major takeaways, with relevant excerpts from the texts. Prepare to take a pretty crazy trip back through time! Citizens would start off every day by eating Romans Jackpot One egg, one pancake, and one big glass of OJ, no ice. That is the ordinary morning meal all Romans eat, called Romans Jackpot. (Virgil, 21 BC) The Romans had developed an early printing press that they used to smash open shellfish via travelviaitaly.com At market, I purchased a great quantity of clams and scallops and brought them directly to the printing house, where the miraculous machine our scholars believe capable of reshaping the continent in the span of a season awaited. I placed my bounty on the tray and, with a few heaves of the handle, they were well-bashed and ready for feasting. (Thallus, 12 BC) The average person did not have a conception of what a dog was and considered dogs to be simply a type of hairy, stupid men via barkpost.com And then the small, hairy boy who we had elected Emperor of the Empire made his idiot gargles right there on the steps of the Capitol, and all who were gathered there cheered. We loved that he had extra legs and no hands, and the generals who commanded the armies of Rome whispered amongst themselves, Lo, the tiny, hairy gentleman who can neither speak nor read, he is a human for sure. He is a great and wildly stupid leader indeed, and we would follow him even into the Underworld. (Quintus Ennius, 224 BC) The Romans loved going to a place called The Square, but its unclear where it was or how they got there I was climbing up the ladder to The Square when I beheld Antonius on horseback riding diagonally toward the Square in the opposite direction. I am off to The Square, said Antonius, and so I said, Me too; see you there. And then Antonius told me that he had also met with Gaius and that he had seen him beneath the sea walking clockwise on his way to The Square. We parted ways, and I climbed the ladder into the clouds until it was time for me to get into the hole, and from there I swam to the caves that would send me both upward and backward, toward The Square, which now was farther away than ever. (Eumenius, AD 280) The Romans went crazy for mints I was sitting in The Square of the capital with all the other Romans, and all of a sudden someone took out a little bag of mints and started shaking it, like, Look what Ive got, you shitheads. Before long, it was a massacre. Everyone was scrambling for the mints. Fathers were killing their sons; brother turned on brother. Rome was bathed in a sea of blood. In the end, 20 lucky people got mints, and one of the mints fell on the ground, so nobody ate that one. (Gaius Acilius, 152 BC) "
0," In response to the international uproar created when he reportedly compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Hitler, His Royal Highness Prince Charles today issued the following letter of apology to the Russian people. My dear Russians, Yesterday, it was reported that I compared your President Putin to Hitler. If by making this comment I have in some way offended you, I am deeply sorry. Adolf Hitler was one of the horrible villains in world history, and comparing President Putin to him was uncalled for. What I should have said, and what I say to you now, is that this Putin chap can be a bit Hitlery at times. Lets take, for example, his penchant for taking territory that doesnt belong to him and then adding it to his country and so forth. Would you call that behavior Hitlery or not Hitlery? From where I sit, its more like something Hitler would do than something he wouldnt do, and so the verdict must be, yes, the chap is being rather Hitlery when he does that. And, while were on the subject, what about Putins use of tanks? Also very Hitlery. Again, let me be clear: I am not calling him Hitlerbut if you think you can use tanks and not come off a tad bit Hitlery, youre not right in the head. Since I made my remarks, some British politicians have suggested that I abdicate my position as Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne. In other words, they believe that I do not have the right to free speech. If memory serves, back in the nineteen-thirties another chap went around trying to punish people for speaking their minds. Im not going to name names, but if the shoe fits Yours truly, H.R.H. Prince Charles "
0,"Canada announced today that it was tightening security along its border with the United States amid concerns that there could be a mass migration of illegal Americans after Tuesday, November 6th. According to Randolph McTavish, Deputy Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, border patrols are on alert due to an increase in chatter indicating that a threat to Canadas border might be imminent. Weve been intercepting troubling comments from some very freaked-out people, he said. Most of it has been on NPR call-in shows. Stating that the R.C.M.P. is patrolling every kilometre of the Canadian border, he issued this warning to Americans who might try to cross into Canada illegally: If you drive a Prius, you will be stopped. He also warned Americans against trying to slip across the border in the hopes of passing as Canadians: It is very difficult, if not impossible, to pretend to like hockey. Mr. McTavish said that he was sympathetic with those who might flee across the border in search of a new life and socialized medicine, but added, At the end of the day, forty-seven per cent of Americans is more than Canada can handle.

0,"Republican lawmakers in the Texas State Senate are proposing a precedent-setting new bill that would make it illegal for women to live in the state. Senator Harland Dorrinson, one of the many pro-life lawmakers backing the woman ban, crafted his bill after witnessing Senator Wendy Davis filibuster an anti-abortion bill last month. That was our moment to say, Enough is enough, he said. This comes down to a choice between life and women, and we choose life. Senator Dorrinson said his bill would call for a twenty-foot woman-proof fence to be constructed along the borders of the state. Women are great at talking, but not at climbing, he observed. But another G.O.P. state senator, Cal Jamson, believes that the total ban on women goes too far and is proposing a less draconian bill that would allow some women to remain in the state as guest workers. Texas needs women to cook, clean, and cheerlead, he said. If they show that they can do those things and stay out of politics, there could be a pathway to citizenship. "
0,"National Rifle Association C.E.O. Wayne LaPierre used his opening speech at the N.R.A.s national convention today to highlight several challenges facing the organization, including what he called the rising cost of Senators. Over the past few years, weve seen the price of purchasing a Senator surge astronomically, he told the N.R.A. faithful. Unless something is done to make Senators more affordable, the ability of a tiny lobbying group to overrule the wishes of ninety per cent of the American people will be in jeopardy. The days are over, he said, when you could buy a Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) for little more than pocket change. Now it costs thousands to purchase a marginally effective Senator like Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), he said. Mr. LaPierre was followed at the podium by the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the rock musician Ted Nugent, and several other people who would not pass background checks. "

0,"In what economists are hailing as a clear sign of economic recovery, Walmart customers across the U.S.A. jammed into stores on Black Friday, sometimes killing each other to buy useless shit. We have been looking for evidence that the economy is on the mend, said Davis Logsdon, chairman of the economics department at the University of Minnesota. When people resort to homicide to buy a Blu-ray player, that is very, very good news indeed. Mr. Logsdon said he was impressed by the lengths to which some Walmart customers were going to grab coveted sale items: Theyre using tactics we usually associate with the U.C.-Davis police. With many customers using pepper spray and other weapons to get a shopping advantage, however, Mr. Logsdon advised Americans not to enter a Walmart unarmed. If you want to get your hands on a doorbuster, youd better have a firearm, he said. Fortunately, Walmart is offering several great doorbusters on firearms. Walmart and other retailers decision to commence their Black Friday sales a day early carries with it an added benefit for consumers, he noted: Now Americans will be able to declare bankruptcy one day earlier. All in all, Dr. Logsdon said that the increased violence and mayhem at retail outlets across the country was a testament to the greatness of the American consumer. Egyptians risk their lives for new government, he said. Americans bravely do the same for new flat screens. "
0,"Well, heres some morbidly fascinating news. A recent study by the Federal Aviation Administration examined the black box audio recordings from hundreds of doomed planes for clues to what caused them to crash and made a major discovery: Most crashes are caused by the pilot holding a turkey drumstick in each hand. Yikes! Really makes you wonder how many close calls youve had at 28,000 feet. The researchers pored over black box recordings from nearly 1,000 downed flights looking for evidence of what caused the planes to crash. Again and again, they found disturbing conversations like this one: After analyzing more than 500 similar conversations suggesting that a pilot holding drumsticks was the principal factor in a plane crash, the researchers divided these incidents into four categories, listed below in descending order of frequency: "
0,"On the eve of the Israeli Prime Ministers address to Congress, House Speaker John Boehner used a joint press conference to praise Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him our closest and most important ally in the fight against President Obama. Even as the President threatens us with provocative acts, Prime Minister Netanyahus support for us has been unwavering, Boehner said. He understands what many of us have long known: that peace with this enemy can only be achieved through total victory. Netanyahu had equally high praise for Boehner, saying that no one has been more steadfast and dedicated in the struggle against your President. This foe is not to be trusted or appeased, Netanyahu said. Your resolute refusal to find any common ground with him whatsoever has earned my undying respect. As the press conference drew to a conclusion, Boehner appeared to fight back tears as he called Netanyahu a brother in arms in the ongoing hostilities with Obama. A wise man once said that my enemys enemy is my friend, Boehner said, choking up. You, sir, are my best friend in the world. "
0,"Its about time. As support continues to wane for disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, Dartmouth College announced this week that it would be awarding the comedian an honorary degree just so that they can rescind it. More than 50 women to date have come forward to accuse Cosby of sexual misconduct, prompting the universitys honorary degrees committee to formally recognize the Cosby Show stars contributions to comedy and African-American culture before swiftly repealing the honor the following day. Based on Mr. Cosbys actions, we feel that we have no choice but to give him this award on November 9th and then take it away the following morning, said Dartmouth College president Phillip J. Hanlon in a statement Wednesday. We feel it is only appropriate that Dartmouth honors Mr. Cosbys contributions to entertainment and the portrayal of African Americans in the media, and then immediately announce that his behavior was deplorable and that he does not stand for the values of Dartmouth. The evening will consist of a VIP banquet honoring Bill Cosbys influence through more than five decades of stand-up comedy, a screening of his greatest moments from film and television, and the presentation of the award, followed quickly by a press release taking the award away. It may be too late to take Cosby to court, but hopefully by awarding him one of its highest accolades and then stripping it from him immediately, Dartmouth can play a crucial role in ruining his legacy for good! Justice served. "
0,"In the aftermath of former Virginia senator James Webbs announcement that he is quitting the Democratic Presidential primary, a new poll shows his bitter rival Lincoln Chafee surging to two per cent of likely voters. The former Rhode Island governor, whose path to the White House was predicated on knocking Webb out of the race, could not contain his jubilation as he told supporters in Concord, New Hampshire, that his campaign is now solidly in the single digits. Accompanied by the blaring strains of the rock anthem More Than a Feeling, by Boston, Chafee served notice that he has only begun to fight. Were at two per cent now, but this is only the beginning, my friends, a pumped-up Chafee told his audience. The Chafee train has left the station, and the next stop is three per cent. Chafee told supporters that the next challenge he faces is overtaking the former Maryland governor Martin OMalley, whose standing in the new poll is a lofty four per cent. OMalley probably thinks I cant take him, but thats what Jim Webb thought, the pugnacious Rhode Islander said. Martin OMalley is going down! "
0,"Well, that took long enough! Next time you go to Wikipedia, type the word racism into the search bar and youll be pleasantly surprised. Because thanks to some intrepid social justice seekers, what was once a page dedicated to this antiquated and ignorant ideology has been absolutely torn to shreds. And frankly, its about time. It all started with one simple yet powerful edit, when a person changed the title of the page from Racism to Stop Racism. After that, the floodgates were open, and the edits started pouring in. People began changing every mention of the word slavery to read slavery is wrong. Then, every reference to the N-word was replaced with a new, more progressive version of the N-word: NO MORE RACISM. And just when you thought the internet was done, check out what users added to the section detailing the history of racism: Take that, racists. Thats what the internet thinks of your history. Take a look at some of the other changes people have been making: Perfect. And it got even better from there. Pretty soon, people were deleting entire sections from the page. The entry for Segregation? Gone. Cultural Racism? Goodbye! So far, Wikipedia moderators seem to be doing their best to restore the page, but internet users are clearly too much for them to handle! Theres been overwhelming support for this cause, as people all across social media are expressing their gratitude that some noble SJWs finally took action. Just check out these tweets: Thank you, internet, for showing racists that their time is up and that theres no place for hate on the web! "
0,"Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush announced that he was dropping out of the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, while standing in front of a Mission Accomplished banner draped over the faade of his campaign headquarters, in Miami. Speaking to his remaining staff members who were seated in a dozen folding chairs, Bush thanked them for the hard work that led to the triumphant completion of their mission. Our work is done, Bush said. Thanks to you, we have prevailed. While acknowledging that he took pride in the impressive success of his campaign, Bush stressed that victory did not belong to him alone. This is a great day for America, he said. Upon the conclusion of his remarks, Bush bade farewell to his staffers with a military-style salute before stepping into a waiting helicopter and ascending to the skies. Minutes after Bush flew away, however, reporters asked senior Bush staffers to define more clearly the mission that Bush had deemed accomplished. We feel really good about the work we did, our ground game, getting the word out about Jebs accomplishments as a conservative Governor in Florida, said Bushs campaign manager, Danny Diaz, who added, Please, just leave me alone.

0,"In an explosive accusation, the House Oversight Committee chairman Darrell Issa (R-California) today charged President Obama with using all the resources at his disposal to make the Affordable Care Act work. Accusing the President of participating in a wide-ranging conspiracy, Mr. Issa told reporters that behind closed doors, the President has quietly assembled a high-tech brain trust that is working around the clock to fix the Healthcare.gov Web siteat government expense. Rep. Issa said that he would call for a new round of hearings and would subpoena all those persons suspected of being involved in the ongoing plot to fix Obamacare. This is a conspiracy, if you will, that goes all the way to the top, Rep. Issa said. If there is a plan to fix Obamacare, what did the President know about that plan and when did he know it? Rep. Issa concluded his remarks on a defiant note, drawing a line in the sand: If the President thinks he is going to repair that Web site so that it works when anyone tries to access it, Ive got news for him: not on my watch.

0,"It seems as if Jeb Bush is finally having his long-awaited breakout moment: His name was recently discovered on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and his poll numbers have been skyrocketing ever since! Yep, this is a game-changer! Months into his 2016 presidential campaign, Bush had so far failed to captivate Republican voters the way Donald Trump and Ben Carson have. For now, hes still trailing those two frontrunners in the polls, but after the revelation that his name is engraved in the famous Washington, D.C. memorial went public, hes been gaining some serious ground! Bush has been able to break away from the middle of the pack where he had appeared to be stuck, and is quickly closing in on third-place candidate Marco Rubio. If buzz on social media is any indication, he should have Rubio in his rearview mirror within days. What a comeback! Its hard to believe that just a few weeks ago, the Jeb Bush campaign was considered to be on the brink of failure. Its pretty amazing just how far something like having your name on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial can go. No matter what you may think of him, one thing is now clear: Jeb Bush is here to stay. "
0,"The House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California) today called for hearings to investigate why no one has paid any attention to him in the weeks of hearings he has called for thus far. There is mounting evidence that no one listens to me, not even one little bit, he told reporters on Capitol Hill. The goal of these hearings is to find out why. He said that he first became aware that people might not be listening to him when he read a recent poll indicating that Americans primary concerns are jobs and the economy. Anyone in his right mind would know that this nations No. 1 problem right now is Benghazi talking points, he said. The California congressman said that he also intended to investigate the chain of events that have led to people changing the channel the moment they see my face. There is a consensus out there that I am an odious, self-serving tool who uses congressional hearings to advance my own petty political agenda, he said. I think its important to know who created that impression. Finally, Mr. Issa said, he hoped that the new hearings would determine, once and for all, to what extent my moral authority has been undermined by allegations that I have been involved in car theft and arson. The question is, what do the American people know about me and when did they know it? he said. "
0,"The billionaire Koch brothers have approved a controversial plan to shoot cash from cannons directly at voters heading into polling places on Election Day. The plan, which Koch insiders have privately referred to as Operation Money Shot, would distribute as much as seventy million dollars in small bills in the hopes of seizing Republican control of the United States Senate next Tuesday. While most state laws prohibit electioneering within a hundred feet of polling places, the Koch plan craftily skirts that restriction by using high-powered cash cannons, similar to the T-shirt cannons used in sports arenas, which have a range of up to a hundred and fifty feet. According to a spokesman for the Kochs, Under the law, corporations are considered people, and people have always had the right to fire money from cannons at other people. When news of Operation Money Shot reached Democratic circles several weeks ago, there were howls of protest and threats of a legal challenge, as Democratic leaders complained that firing cash directly at voters about to cast their ballots would be a subversion of the election process. But the Supreme Court upheld the Koch brothers plan by a five-to-four vote on Thursday, arguing that spending money on elections was protected by the First Amendment, and that using a cannon was protected by the Second.

0,"Republican Presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney has released the following letter to the American people: Dear American People: Over the past several days, my personal finances have been distorted into a grotesque caricature by the mainstream media, pundits, and other people who can count. I am writing to you to set the record straight by explaining my finances in terms the American people can relate to. Lets say you bought a bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982 for five thousand dollars. A couple of years later, what do you know, you sell that same bottle for ten thousand dollars. So you just made a profit of five thousand dollars through your own hard work. How much of that should you pay to the government? Id say fifteen per cent. Now lets say you have a fellow mowing the lawn at your seven-thousand-square-foot home in La Jolla, and he turns out to be an illegal. You say, No way, Jose (Jose is actually his real name) and send him packing. He doesnt deserve his full paycheck, since he lied to you in Spanish, but it wouldnt be fair to give him nothing, either. So you pay him fifteen per cent. Now lets pretend the United States of America is like one big restaurant. Not a fancy restaurant, mind you, but one that only gets two Michelin stars. And lets say that you order a meal of Beluga caviar, white truffles, and gold shavings, washing it down with your favorite beverage, Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982. The bill arrives and its quite a hefty one for a working stiff who only made three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars last year in speaking fees. (Thats right: minimum wage.) So when it comes to toting up the bill, how much should I tip the waiter, who, in case youre having trouble following this metaphor, is the I.R.S.? You got it: fifteen per cent. I think Ive now shown, using these real-life examples that everyone can relate to, that no one should ever pay more than fifteen per cent on their taxes. If you have been paying more than that, you should get rid of your loser accountant pronto. Thats another thing I have in common with regular Americans: we like firing people. Sonow that Ive laid it out in simple terms that even you can understand, do you agree that you and Mitt Romney have a whale of a lot more in common than you thought? Ill bet you ten grand you do.

Though Roberts has no familial or professional ties to the largely agrarian country in southeast Africa, millions of Malawians are now celebrating the Pretty Woman star as one of their own, displaying her face on government websites, public buses, and their currency. Malawi president Peter Mutharika and the official Malawi government took to Twitter earlier today to publicly praise the A-lister and everything she represents to the countrys 16 million citizens: Malawis tourism board has even announced plans for a promotional campaign centered around Roberts, with ads in popular Western magazines featuring photos of Roberts alongside the slogans Malawi: Where Greatness Begins and Julia Roberts: Malawis No. 1 Export. Whoa. Shots definitely fired. Malawi is really going for the jugular with this brazen attempt to claim Julia Roberts as their own. Does the U.S. have a response? Are we witnessing a feud in the making? We cant wait to see how this one plays out. "
0,"In a possible setback for Mitt Romneys latest Presidential ambitions, a new poll reveals that a majority of Americans now regard the former Massachusetts governor as a stalker. The poll results suggest that Romneys presence in every Presidential campaign in recent memory has taken its toll on the American people, who have expressed disbelief that he would return after being repeatedly told in no uncertain terms that he was not wanted. Additionally, many of those surveyed said that they previously felt harassed by the Massachusetts governors relentless e-mails and phone calls, and favored some form of intervention to keep Romney from contacting them in the future. In an indication of how much Romneys serial candidacies have traumatized the American people, more than fifty per cent said that they would support a restraining order to keep the former nominee five hundred feet from the United States until the 2016 election had safely passed. In an interview on Monday, Romney said that the inauspicious poll results would not discourage him from seeking the White House for a third time. I know that Im the right man for the American people, and nothing they say or do will stop me, he said. "

Today, government officials announced the release of the first U.S. flag featuring a female portrait! Its about time! A dedicated congressional committee carefully chose the new design, which features iconic abolitionist Harriet Tubman front and center. Thats right: 13 stripes, 50 stars, and the face of one strong, inspirational woman waving in the wind! Say goodbye to the days of saluting an outdated flag that doesnt fairly represent modern America. Sure, our flag is just a symbol, but its one that affects the way we think and feel about this country. It may not solve all our problems, but its undeniable that this is definitely a step in the right direction. We cant wait to place a hand over our heart as America raises a brand-new flag! Awesome. "
0,"A week of turmoil in Alabama culminated on Friday with the United States ordering the Southern state to grow up. After a week in which Alabama exhibited various displays of childishnessincluding kicking, screaming, stamping its feet, and threatening to hold its breaththe United States decided to take the extraordinary action of telling the hundred-and-ninety-five-year-old state to act its age. But any hopes that the United States order would be heeded were dashed when Alabama put its fingers in its ears and emitted a stream of monosyllabic nonsense sounds, claiming that the order had been rendered inaudible. That action may have only served to provoke the United States, which issued a subsequent statement characterizing the nations twenty-second state as nothing but a big crybaby. While the United States clearly hoped that that final statement would cause Alabama to think long and hard about what it had done, the states official responseI know you are but what am I?was not encouraging, officials said.

The ceremony, held on the grounds of the Halliburton Company headquarters, brought together the former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and other key members of the lying effort. Calling the assembled officials profiles in fabrication, Mr. Cheney praised them for their decade of dedication to a totally fictitious rationale. Making up a reason to invade a country is the easy part, Mr. Cheney told them. Sticking to a pretend story for ten yearsthat is the stuff of valor. Mr. Cheney added that their steadfast charade had raised the bar for all future Administrations. When it is time to invade Iran or Venezuela, will the President have the will to make up an entirely fake reason to do it? he asked. That remains to be seen. The ceremony ended on an emotional note, as Mr. Cheney placed a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown W.M.D. Former President George W.

That does not mean, however, that it has not been very much on our minds. As thousands have gathered in Lower Manhattan, passionately expressing their deep discontent with the status quo, we have taken note of these protests. And we have asked ourselves this question: How can we make money off them? The answer is the newly launched Goldman Sachs Global Rage Fund, whose investment objective is to monetize the Occupy Wall Street protests as they spread around the world. At Goldman, we recognize that the capitalist system as we know it is circling the drainbut theres plenty of money to be made on the way down. The Rage Fund will seek out opportunities to invest in products that are poised to benefit from the spreading protests, from police batons and barricades to stun guns and forehead bandages. Furthermore, as clashes between police and protesters turn ever more violent, we are making significant bets on companies that manufacture replacements for broken windows and overturned cars, as well as the raw materials necessary for the construction and incineration of effigies. It would be tempting, at a time like this, to say, Let them eat cake. But at Goldman, we are actively seeking to corner the market in cake futures. We project that through our aggressive market manipulation, the price of a piece of cake will quadruple by the end of 2011. Please contact your Goldman representative for a full prospectus. As the world descends into a Darwinian free-for-all, the Goldman Sachs Rage Fund is a great way to tell the protesters, Occupy this. We havent felt so good about something weve sold since our souls. Sincerely, Lloyd Blankfein Chairman, Goldman Sachs "
0,"Get ready to happy cry, because what the Make-A-Wish Foundation did for some sick children is absolutely incredible. The dream-fulfilling nonprofit has just finished construction on a brand-new city where every terminally ill child in the country will get to live out the remainder of their lives. Make-A-Wish City currently has a population of over 14,000 kids diagnosed with incurable diseases, and more are arriving every single day! The metropolis is designed to make each moment an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Wow! Featuring perfect replicas of every major league ballpark, 15 Cinderellas castles, and a fleet of 800 Batmobiles, theres no shortage of places to visit or things to do in the sprawling Make-A-Wish City! Every morning, the children are paid a wake-up call by the full cast of The Avengers, who visit each child in their hospital room to let them hold Thors hammer and beat the Hulk at arm wrestling. Then, a medical team consisting entirely of Chip and Dale impersonators come in to provide their daily medications and replace their IV tubing. And its hard to be scared of MRI machines when theyre all shaped like Shreks head and you get to climb into his mouth! Kids who now live in the city say that moving here was a complete surprise. I fell asleep in my hospital room, and when I woke up, I was in a car sitting next to Jeff Gordon, said Kimberly Schuler, an 8-year-old cancer patient and new resident of Make-A-Wish City. He was driving really fast and told me I was going to my new home. Awesome! According to Make-A-Wish City mayor Dwayne The Rock Johnson, bringing all the nations sick children together is more than just a goodwill gestureit just makes logistical sense. Instead of celebrities spending half their days traveling between different hospitals in different cities, now we can spend 100 percent of our time fulfilling wishes, said Johnson shortly before a live performance in which he leapt out of the window of his third-floor City Hall office, zip-lined across the street, and drop-kicked Maleficent into a public fountain. Its the least we could do for these children in need. Although its sad that these kids are sick, its heartwarming that they can spend their final weeks in their own, totally kick-ass municipality. Faith in humanity restored! "
0," In an effort to distance himself from the legacy of his brother, George W. Bush, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will use a major foreign-policy speech on Wednesday to assert that, if elected President, he would harm the nation in completely different ways. A lot of people are looking at me and thinking that Im just going to be a rerun of my brother, Bush told reporters before the speech. They are greatly underestimating my ability to create chaos and destruction in ways that are uniquely mine. As an example, Bush said, he was unlikely to invade Iraq for a third time, calling such an action too derivative. George already did it, and Dad did it before him, he said. Call it my independent streak, if you will, but I want to spawn some disasters of my own. To that end, Bush said that he and his foreign-policy team were already scanning the globe for new and different places where the United States could become involved in open-ended and pointless quagmires. I see boundless opportunities for the reckless and totally optional insertion of American military force, he said. No offense to my brother, but there were a few spots that George missed. "
0," Calling the Obama Administrations actions against the soccer organization weak and ineffective, Senator John McCain on Thursday proposed military action to dismantle and destroy FIFA once and for all. These are people who only understand one thing: force, McCain said on the floor of the United States Senate. We must make FIFA taste the vengeful might and fury of the United States military. McCain said that he was completely unimpressed by the Department of Justices arrests of several top FIFA lieutenants this week, calling the action the kind of Band-Aid solution that this Administration, sadly, has become famous for. Rounding up a few flunkies in a hotel is meaningless when the leader of FIFA remains at large, he said. I will follow Sepp Blatter to the gates of Hell. McCain requested a four-billion-dollar aid package for moderate elements within global soccer, and said that the United States should be prepared to put boots on the ground in Switzerland. Calling the use of force against FIFA long overdue, he placed the blame for the groups alarming growth squarely on the shoulders of the White House. Barack Obama created FIFA, he said. "
0,"It looks like President Obama has really outdone himself this time. The president showed some real leadership this morning when he took time out of his busy schedule to roll up his sleeves and fish drowned tourists out of the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Nice! Spectators got a peek at the president methodically combing the bottom of the reflecting pool with a fishing net for two full hours. In between his responsibilities as a leader and a father, he still managed to take the time to stack all of the bodies along the side of the reflecting pool for the National Park Service to pick up. And all of this before noon! No matter which side of the aisle youre on, you have to admit the president did a good job. This wasnt just about a photo ophe got in there and made sure he found every last one. By the time he was done, he had a nice, tidy stack of 23 bodies, along with a separate pile of cameras and electronics to be donated to local schools. Nice work, Mr. President! Obama certainly didnt have to do this to prove hes a great president, but were glad he did. This is one president whos ready to do whatever it takes to get the job done! Politicians take note: This is what real leadership looks like. "
0,"Absolutely heartbreaking. 1. Eddie Eddie knew how to fetch, roll over, shake hands, and bark on command. But he couldnt figure out how to live a few months longer. For Eddie, the Sopranos finale came in season six, episode four. 2. Ben Ben was a loyal viewer since the premiere on January 10, 1999. He died a peaceful death at 12 years old, right in the middle of season three. Ben loved watching Tonys crimes; this poochs only one was being born too early. 3. Maggie Nothing could be sadder than the season four finale, when an angry and heartbroken Carmela finally confronts Tony about his infidelity, but Maggies sudden onset hip dysplasia sure comes close. 4. Lady Unaware of her impending demise, Lady made the tragic mistake of choosing to watch the final episode of Sex And The City instead of the final episode of The Sopranos. 5. Bailey Pit bulls are tough. John Sacrimoni was tough. Maybe its best for Bailey that she succumbed to lung cancer before she had to see Johnny Sack do the same. 6. Daisy Hours before the premiere of season six, tragedy struck, as Daisy was found unresponsive in her familys master bedroom. Was it a mob hit? No. But is it devastating that she never got to see what happened to Tony and the rest of the DiMeo crime family? You bet it is. 7. Bella As an Italian greyhound, Bella never made up her mind about whether The Sopranos was a respectful portrait of Italian-American life or a perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. In fact, the only thing Bella really ever made up her mind about was licking up antifreeze in the garage between seasons 6A and 6B. 8. Nala Yeah, Nala was pretty much gone halfway through episode one. "
0," Sarah Palins online video service starring herself had a hugely successful launch on Monday, as millions of Americans paid $9.95 for the rare opportunity of hearing the former Alaska Governor speak. The Web site for The Sarah Palin Channel reportedly crashed several times during the day, as it was overwhelmed by subscribers seeking a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of the reclusive Palin sharing her opinions. At the corporate headquarters of the Palin Channel, the marketing director Tracy Klugian attributed the sites mammoth success to the simple law of supply and demand. The Governor is a very private person who chooses her words very, very carefully, Klugian said. When someone like that finally decides to speak out, millions of people will pay to hear what she has to say. Harland Dorrinson, aged sixty-two, of Flint, Michigan, was just one of the millions of Americans who jammed Governor Palins channel on Monday, only to find that the site had frozen under the weight of traffic. Ill keep refreshing the page until I finally get through, he said. Hearing Sarah Palin talk isnt something that happens every day. Media experts said Monday that the stunning launch of Palins Web site bodes well for the upcoming video channel from another rarely seen personality, Donald Trump. "
0,"The billionaire Donald Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States has sparked deep disappointment among his supporters, many of whom had hoped he was planning to ban a sizable number of other religions. In conversations with likely Trump voters across the country, reactions ranged from disenchantment to a sharp sense of betrayal as supporters tried to make sense of his decision to ban members of only one faith. I heard him on TV talking about banning Muslims and I was kind of like, Is that it? said Carol Foyler, a Trump supporter from South Florida. I mean, banning Muslims is a good start, but I thought a smart businessman like him would be a lot more thorough. Harland Dorrinson, a Trump supporter from San Antonio, Texas, agreed. Saying youre only going to ban Muslims when there are so many other religious groups to ban just feels like politics as usual, he said. Ill give him a chance to explain himself on this one, but Id be lying if I said I didnt feel burned. But Tracy Klugian, a Trump supporter from Bismarck, North Dakota, said that voters who were upset with the billionaire for banning members of only one religion were freaking out over nothing. People need to understand that hes banning Muslims first because theyre the most obvious religious group youd want to ban, she said. Im sure once hes President hell get to all the other ones. "
0,"With less than two weeks to go until Election Day, there is a deep divide among Republican leaders over whether to emphasize misogyny or racism as the campaigns closing theme. In one camp is the Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who says that his view that God is sometimes O.K. with rape is gaining real traction with a key demographic: men who dont like women very much. I cant tell you how many misogynists have come up to me at my rallies and said, Thank you for saying what you said, he told reporters today. I think theyre like, finally, someones taking a more nuanced position on rape. But in the other camp is the former New Hampshire governor John Sununu, who worries that the Republican Partys emphasis on misogyny is threatening to drown out its winning message of racism. I understand the appeal of Mourdocks anti-woman theme, but I worry that its going to overshadow our core value of racism, which is still our best shot at winning this thing, he said. In politics, youve got to dance with the one who brung you. Hoping to heal a possible rift with so little time left until Election Day, the R.N.C. chairman Reince Priebus said today that there is room for both views in todays Republican Party: Our big tent message to voters should be this: come for the misogyny, stay for the racism. "
0,"An endorsement from former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is expected to widen Donald J. Trumps already impressive lead among so-called idiot voters, an aide to the billionaire said on Tuesday. While Trump was previously thought to have a lock on the idiot vote heading into the Iowa caucuses, a recent surge by Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, has put the idiots back in play. Cruz has worked tirelessly in recent weeks to tailor his message to undecided idiots, even revamping his stump speech to rid it of two-syllable words. Thats why Palin supporting Trump and not Cruz is such a win for us, the Trump aide said. Shes been out of politics for awhile, but she still has idiot cred. The aide said that no one should be surprised by the bond between Palin and Trump. Theyre both reality-show hosts, he said. And by lowering the bar in 2008, Palin singlehandedly made Trumps candidacy possible. But even as the Trump campaign staffers celebrate the Palin endorsement, they recognize that they still have their work cut out for them to secure victory in Iowa. Getting the idiots to support Trump is only half the battle, the aide said. Now we have to make sure that they make it to the caucuses without getting lost on the way.

0,"Flanked by members of his states legislature on Wednesday afternoon, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal proudly unveiled Georgias new official state slogan, We Make Florida Look Safe. Gov. Deal told reporters that the slogan was more than just words, reflecting Georgias determination to best its rival Florida for the nations most reckless gun law. When Florida passed Stand Your Ground, we knew we were playing catch-up, Gov. Deal said. Thanks to the fine men and women in the Georgia state legislature, were No. 1. Gov. Deal said he hoped that the states newly enacted Safe Carry Protection Act, which makes it legal to carry guns in bars, schools, churches, and some government buildings, would send the message that Georgia was taking its competition with Florida very, very seriously. In recent years, if you wanted to fire off a gun any damn place you pleased, there was a sense that Florida was the state for you, he said. Were hoping to change that perception. "
0,"In what some are calling a move designed to help him connect better with voters, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney today began sprinkling himself with bits of bacon before each campaign appearance. According to one campaign staffer, the decision to sprinkle Mr. Romney with a zesty meat topping was inspired by Burger Kings announcement that it would soon be selling a Bacon Sundae at its fast-food restaurants. Apparently, everything is a little more palatable with bacon on top, the staffer said. Even Mitt Romney. As part of the bacon rollout, the campaign changed its official slogan today from Romney: Believe in America to Romney: Now with Yummy Bacon. The newly meat-flavored Romney appeared at a rally in Columbus, where his audience gave his generous sprinkling of bacon bits a tentative thumbs-up. I thought his speech was kind of boring, said Carol Foyler, forty-four, a receptionist for a Columbus law firm. But he smelled delicious. Not so impressed, however, was computer programmer Tracy Klugian, twenty-five: I was sitting in the front row, and Im pretty sure Romneys bacon bits were fake. Burger Kings launch of its Bacon Sundae has already had repercussions for its principal rival, McDonalds, which today announced plans to introduce a new McDeathwich. "
0,"President Obamas handling of controversies about the I.R.S., the Justice Department, and Benghazi has raised grave doubts about his ability to cope if he ever became involved in an actual scandal, prominent Republicans said today. If this is how he handles this stuff, Lord have mercy on him if he ever has to deal with a real scandal, said newly elected Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S. Carolina). Quite frankly, I dont think he has what it takes. The true test of a leader is this, Rep. Sanford added. When he gets in a fix, does he have the presence of mind to lie about his whereabouts? Sadly, I dont think President Obama passes that test. Mr. Sanfords concerns mirror those of another leading Republican lawmaker, Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana). If President Obama honestly thinks hes dealing with scandals right now, Im pretty sure he doesnt know what a scandal is, Sen. Vitter said. And thats very worrisome. When you get that three A.M. phone call, and its a reporter claiming that a prostitute said you like to dress up in a diaper, are you prepared for that call? Sen. Vitter said. In the case of President Obama, I am afraid that the answer is no. "
0,"In a potential stumbling block for his Presidential ambitions, a new study indicates that the average American can stand only four seconds of exposure to Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican. The study, conducted by University of Minnesota researchers during Tuesday nights Republican debate, required subjects to be connected to electrodes to measure their tolerance for the senator. Within four seconds of watching Cruz, the majority of participants begged to be released from the experiment, researchers reported. In a more encouraging finding for the senator, when the same research subjects were exposed to Cruz with his voice muted, they could tolerate him for up to six seconds, the data showed. According to the University of Minnesotas Davis Logsdon, who supervised the study, the results portend significant challenges ahead for Cruzs campaign. Its hard to get your message out if, four seconds in, people just start screaming uncontrollably, as many of our participants did last night, he said. A campaign spokesman for Cruz, however, was unfazed by the research. A study conducted last summer showed that people could only stand Ted for three seconds, so were trending in the right direction, the spokesman said.

Just hours after the deal was inked, Rubio was flown by private jet to Singers training facility in East Hampton, where the senator will submit to a series of gruelling drills before the deal is finalized. We are making a four-year deal with Marco, with an option for another four, an associate of Singers said. We like what weve seen of him on tape, but we want to be sure that he has what it takes to go the distance. According to those familiar with Singers physical workouts for political candidates, Rubio will submit to a number of demanding tests, in which the billionaire will bark commands and the senator will be measured for his reaction times and accuracy. You have to be in peak condition for these workouts, the associate said. Jeb got totally winded. Arriving at Singers training camp, Rubio said he was excited and honored to be a part of the Singer organization. I talked to a lot of other billionaires, he told reporters. Sheldon Adelson, and the Koch brothers, of course. But at the end of the day Mr. Singers scheme was the best fit. Im looking forward to earning every dollar he paid for me.

0,"A government think tank today proposed a controversial new law, No Politician Left Behind, which would pay congressmen solely on the basis of performance. The law, which was proposed by the University of Minnesotas Institute of Government, would make a serious dent in the federal deficit because few if any congressmen would ever have to be paid, said the Institutes director, Davis Logsdon. Right now, congressmen get paid even when they storm out of budget negotiations in a hissy fit, Mr. Logsdon said. Under this new law, the rule would be, no budget, no paycheck. The idea of being paid per accomplishment drew howls of protest from lawmakers, many claiming that if the law were enacted it would result in their financial ruin. If passed, this law would be tantamount to the establishment of work panels, which would determine whether individual congressmen are accomplishing anything, said Representative Eric Cantor (R., Va.). I, for one, would be in deep, deep trouble. Im fairly sure that this law is unconstitutional, said Senator Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Now, I have never actually read the Constitution, but if this law were passed I would probably be forced to read it or live in a cardboard box. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said that creating performance standards for lawmakers was an insult to the institution of Congress. We have spent millions of dollars, some of it out of our own pockets, to get to Washington, he said. We did not come here to be treated like teachers. "
0,"A group representing Americas hostage-takers today blasted President Obama for his repeated comparisons between them and the Tea Party Republicans, calling his remarks degrading and hurtful. The complaint came from the National Alliance of Hostage-Takers and Blackmailers, a watchdog group that monitors negative images of extortionists in the media. As professional hostage-takers, we never take hostages unless we have a well-thought-out plan, realistic demands, and a clear exit strategy, read the groups official statement. Any comparison between what we do and these inane Tea Party antics are derogatory and unacceptable. The statement continued, For years, our members have been subjected to offensive Hollywood stereotypes of hostage-takers as crazed madmen, cackling evildoers, and worse. The Presidents hurtful remarks only reinforce those negative images. Later in the day, White House press spokesman Jay Carney offered an apology to the group: As you can imagine, in the heat of a crisis we often say things we dont mean. The President regrets any hurt his remarks may have caused. Mr. Carney said that in order to avoid offending other groups in the future, the President would resist the temptation to call the Tea Party Republicans terrorists, lunatics, or babies. "
0,"In a sign of renewed confidence, just minutes after former House Speaker Newt Gingrich romped to victory in the South Carolina primary he changed his Facebook status to In an Open Relationship. Mr. Gingrich made no reference to his new Facebook status during his victory speech, in which he made an emotional appeal to the American people: I say to each and every one of you: Join me. Join me in my marriage. The former House Speaker used the speech to highlight the differences between himself and the current resident of the White House: The American people have a choice: Do they want a President who issues food stamps, or one who runs up a five-hundred-thousand-dollar tab at Tiffany? Mr. Gingrich drew cheers and a standing ovation as he concluded his remarks, saying, In closing, I am staying at the Marriott, Room 205. Ladies? In yet another boost, Mr. Gingrich received this nod from former rival Herman Cain: I am not endorsing Newt Gingrich, but I am endorsing Newt Gingrichs lifestyle. At the White House, President Obama made only a glancing reference to the results in South Carolina, telling reporters, I havent been this happy since we smoked bin Laden. For his part, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney minimized Mr. Gingrichs twelve-per-cent margin of victory: Thats even less than I pay in taxes. "

0,"A new poll released today shows the Presidential race extremely tight among voters who had no access to a working television for the past two weeks. On the campaign trail, Republican nominee Mitt Romney seemed buoyed by the news, urging his audience not to watch television, read newspapers, or log on to the Internet between now and Election Day. Mr. Romney attempted to rebut Vice-President Joe Bidens biggest applause line from last night by telling supporters, On Day One of my Presidency I will kill General Motors and bring Osama bin Laden back to life. As for President Obamas biggest applause line, I am the President of the United States, Fox News said they were fact-checking it.

According to several accounts, Mr. Travolta flew to Ukraine in his self-piloted private jet in the hopes of raising morale in the embattled country, but only served to perplex Ukrainians with a brief but indecipherable speech. In his remarks, Mr. Travolta referred to Ukraine as Cranium and Crimea as IKEA before hopping back into his cockpit and flying away.

In his introduction, the Prince of Darkness said he rarely reads political memoirs but made an exception in the case of Mr. Cheney because we had worked so closely together in the past. When he began to read the Cheney manuscript, however, the Lord of Misrule said he was surprised by what he found. Quite honestly, I couldnt put it down, Satan wrote. It was almost like a book I would have written myself. In what could be construed as minor criticism of the book, Satan admitted he was miffed that Mr. Cheney took total credit for the idea of invading Iraq, but added, We were such close collaborators at the time, it may be hard for Dick to remember whose idea was whosehalf the time we were finishing each others sentences. While Satan said he is unlikely to make a habit of writing introductions to books, he said that he could foresee making another exception in the future: Ive heard Rupert Murdoch is working on his memoir. Elsewhere, after Representative Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.) said God created last weeks earthquake and hurricane to punish America, God issued this rebuttal: Actually, thats why I created Michele Bachmann.

0,"Well, this is amazing. Earlier today, researchers at Duke University announced that they have taken a crucial step forward in the fight against cancer, and, for whatever reason, youll never hear about it again. Wow. Chalk up another victory for science! This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of how cancer cells multiply and what causes some forms of cancer to be more aggressive than others, said Dr. Leonard Bryant, one of the head researchers on the project thatll somehow never be reported about ever again. We hope this revolutionizes how doctors treat patients suffering from even the most severe forms of cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer kills almost 600,000 people in the United States each year. Hopefully, this breakthrough could save thousands of lives, but more than likely this is the last any of us will hear of it. Even though we only tested the potential cure on mice with pancreatic cancer, we are confident that it could be used on a wide variety of cancers as well, continued Bryant, in what will probably be the last quote by him youll ever read. This really could be a big step in our understanding of cancer. Just incredible! We can only hope that this development leads to other major breakthroughs well only ever hear about once. "
0,"A new poll indicates that the American people are deeply disappointed in Hillary Clintons State Department e-mail flap because it does not live up to the high standards of sordidness set by Clinton scandals of the past. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the poll for the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, said that those surveyed were receptive and even intrigued by the idea of a new Clinton scandal, but then were deflated when they learned what the scandal actually involved. When people hear the words Clinton scandal, they expect a certain amount of sex and sleaze, Logsdon said. But once they find out that this one is about State Department e-mail regulations which may or may not have been disobeyed, they feel very let down. In a sense, the Clintons have created this problem for themselves, Logsdon added. They set an extremely high bar with some very memorable scandals in the past, and for a lot of people, this one just doesnt live up to the hype. The current scandal could be salvaged in the publics eye if some of Hillary Clintons e-mails turn out to have sexual content, but Logsdon called that a long shot. The poll results show that theres a genuine appetite out there for a juicy Clinton scandal, he said. But, sadly, theres also a sense that maybe they did their best work in the nineties. "
0," A new poll released Wednesday revealed that people rank President Barack Obama as the worst President since the Second World War, and also blame him for starting the Second World War. While the respondents slammed the President for his handling of the economy, Iraq, and a host of other issues, his perceived role as the primary cause of the Second World War was the biggest drag on his numbers. Even more troubling, when compared to the three leaders of the Axis powers during that war, President Obama polled at the bottom of the list, finishing far behind Emperor Hirohito of Japan. Fair or not, the American people hold the President responsible for starting the Second World War, Davis Logsdon, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota, said. If the President hasnt gotten his version of the story out, theres only one person to blame for that: Barack Obama. In other poll results, the most popular President in the survey was Ronald Reagan, widely credited with ending the Second World War. "
0,"Russian President Vladimir Putin received strong, unqualified words of support last night in a ninety-minute conversation with himself, Mr. Putin confirmed today. The invasion of Crimea was the main topic of the conversation, which Mr. Putin described as extremely collegial and enthusiastic. We discussed a wide range of issues, including how everyone in Ukraine had invited us to come to Ukraine, and also how the soldiers reported to be in Crimea were not actually Russian soldiers but, in fact, local volunteers who looked a lot like Russian soldiers, he said. There was strong agreement on all of these matters. Mr. Putin pronounced the ninety-minute conversation exceedingly helpful. He added: It was exhilarating to be able to talk at length with someone for whom I have such boundless love and respect. Buoyed by last nights positive dialogue, Mr. Putin said that he planned to have many such conversations in the days and weeks ahead. It was good to hear how splendidly everything was going, he said.

0,"Millions of Americans awoke on Monday to the shocking news that a gigantic corporation with unprecedented power over their lives had allegedly abused that power for commercial gain. Across the United States, stunned consumers were shaking their heads in disbelief after learning that a gargantuan company whose explicit goal is to make as many billions of dollars as possible through any means available would put its own interests ahead of those of its customers. It never would have occurred to me that an enormous corporation with the ability to track over half a billion customers would ever exploit that advantage in any way, said Harland Dorrinson, twenty-nine, a caterer from Albuquerque. Like a lot of other people, I feel used. Carol Foyler, thirty-eight, a human-resources administrator from Pittsburgh, echoed the reactions of many who were blindsided by the news. I definitely feel like Ive lost my innocence today, she said. If you cant trust a multi-billion-dollar corporation to do the right thing, who can you trust? "
0,"After Facebooks shares plummeted in after-hours trading today, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg issued the following personal letter to all nine hundred million Facebook users. Dear Facebook user: Hey its Mark. It seems like just yesterday that Facebook had its historic I.P.O. and, thanks to you, my net worth soared to a staggering $20 billion. What an awesome day that was for both of us. Today was a different kind of day. Facebook shares are plunging because the geniuses on Wall Street expect us to, and I quote, make money. Thats why your Facebook friend Mark needs your help. Facebook only makes money if people click on its ads. Do you know what Facebook ads are? Theyre those things on your Facebook page that you have never clicked on even once. But at Facebook were looking to change that. After doing extensive market research, we learned that there is one time when people actually do click on Facebook ads: when theyre drunk. This is the same business model that iTunes is based on. Im sure a few of you have had the experience of using Facebook late at night, only to wake up and find that youve gotten seven auto-insurance quotes or enrolled as a criminal-justice major at the University of Phoenix. Why am I sharing this information with you? Simple. If you want to save Facebookand I know that you doI need you to start drinking now. At Facebook headquarters, we like to have all-night coding parties where we get shitfaced and write algorithms and other computer stuff you wouldnt understand. I want you to do the same thing, except instead of coding, I want you to click on random ads for Ancestry.com and Christian Mingle, over and over and over again. You dont even have to buy anythingjust keep clicking. And drinking. Now, you might be asking yourself, Why do I have to help Mark out? Isnt Facebooks stock price his problem? Well, in a sense, yes. But maybe this is a good time to remind you that I have cached all of those photos you posted of yourself doing Jgerbomb jello shots at that Tri Delt party in 2007. And Ill bet your future employers would love to take a peek at them. Kthxbye Mark "
0,"With an eye toward a Presidential run in 2016, Rick Perry, the Texas governor, is hoping that a two-pronged strategy of wearing glasses and not speaking will make him appear smarter to voters, aides to the Governor confirmed today. After the 2012 Republican primary, we knew that we needed to solve what we called the Governors smartness problem, said Harland Dorrinson, an aide to Perry. The fix that we came up with was glasses, but, as it turned out, that was only half the solution. After outfitting Perry with designer eyewear, aides sent him on the road to reintroduce himself to voters, but the response, Mr. Dorrinson said, was underwhelming: The problem was, he was still talking. A round of focus groups convinced aides that only through a combination of wearing glasses and not emitting any sounds could Perry overcome voters initial impressions of him. At a recent political stop in San Antonio, the newly minted Governor Perry was on display, wearing his glasses and gesticulating expressively while saying nothing for thirty minutes. Our focus groups show people no longer know what Rick Perry is thinking, said Mr. Dorrinson. Thats a huge improvement. "
0,"In a shocking end to an illustrious legal career, police arrested Justice Antonin Scalia today as he attempted to set the Supreme Court building ablaze. Justice Scalia, who had seemed calm and composed during the announcement of two major rulings this morning, was spotted by police minutes later outside the building, carrying a book of matches and a gallon of kerosene. After police nabbed Justice Scalia and placed him in handcuffs, the Juror appeared at peace and resigned to his fate, a police spokesman said. He went quietly, the spokesman said. He just muttered something like, I dont want to live in a world like this. Back at the Supreme Court, Justice Scalias colleagues said they hoped he would get the help he needed, except for Justice Clarence Thomas, who said nothing. "
0,"In what is being hailed as a rare example of bipartisan coperation, Senate Democrats and Republicans came together today on a near-unanimous vote to defund Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The measure, which shuts down all nonessential functions of Sen. Cruz, passed by a margin of ninety-nine to one. As the final vote was announced this morning, Sen. Cruzs microphone was unplugged and the Senate exploded with cheers on both sides of the aisle. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said that the vote to defund the Texas senator showed that bipartisan coperation is possible even in the usually rancorous Senate: Every now and then the two parties can reach across the aisle and find something that we both despise with all our might. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) acknowledged that the budget impact of defunding Sen. Cruz would be minimal, but added, This was never about money. We got Ted Cruz to stop talking, and you cant put a price tag on that. "
0,"The United States government charged former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden with spying on Friday, apparently unaware that in doing so it had created a situation dripping with irony. At a press conference to discuss the accusations, an N.S.A. spokesman surprised observers by announcing the spying charges against Mr. Snowden with a totally straight face. These charges send a clear message, the spokesman said. In the United States, you cant spy on people. Seemingly not kidding, the spokesman went on to discuss another charge against Mr. Snowdenthe theft of government documents: The American people have the right to assume that their private documents will remain private and wont be collected by someone in the government for his own purposes. Only by bringing Mr. Snowden to justice can we safeguard the most precious of American rights: privacy, added the spokesman, apparently serious. "
0,"In a poll of Democratic voters taken immediately following Thursday nights Vice-Presidential debate, a wide majority said they wanted Vice-President Joe Biden to appear in all remaining 2012 debates. According to the constitutional scholar Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, the scenario of Mr. Biden appearing in all the remaining debates, while surely unorthodox, is within the realm of possibility: According to the Constitution, the Vice-President steps in when the President is unable to fulfill his duties. Based on the first debate, that seems to be the case. Mr. Biden got off to a strong start in the debate, which began with moderator Martha Raddatz asking him and Rep. Paul Ryan, Gentlemen, first question: To the best of your ability, smirk sarcastically at your opponent. The Vice-President rose to that challenge, smiling broadly and snickering throughout all of Mr. Ryans answers, and characterizing them with virtually every Irish synonym for shit. Mr. Bidens performance clearly wowed the Democratic voters in the post-debate poll, as ninety per cent of them strongly agreed with the statement, Obama should crush a little bit of Joe Biden into a joint and smoke it.

0,"Well, this is awesome. Most 90s kids will remember Brian Bonsall from his role in the movie Blank Check, where he portrayed Preston Waters, a kid who has the once-in-a-lifetime chance to spend a million dollars however he pleases. Now, theres a new reason to obsess over the former child star. The kid from Blank Check is back, and hes got a whole lot of peppers! Nice! Yep, Brian has done a lot of growing up since the films debut in 1994, and from the looks of it, hes spent some of that time amassing peppers! The photo above, posted earlier this week, depicts Brian showing off his many peppers. When last we saw Brian, he was just 14 years old and didnt have a single pepper, and now lookhe sure has come a long way! Who couldve guessed that Brian would go from fresh-faced child star to owning such a huge amount of peppers? Its a reminder that no matter how many peppers a kid has right now, you never know how many peppers theyll have later. Seems like one moment, theyre just kids, then you blink and suddenly they have more peppers than you can count! Wow. Just look at all those peppers! "
0,"In an outburst that shocked many onlookers at the Supreme Court today, Justice Antonin Scalia said that it made him angry beyond belief that he had to listen to people talking about gay couples all week. As Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned whether it was appropriate for the Court to hear a case about same-sex marriage at this time, Mr. Scalia stunned observers with an emotional outburst. O.K., could we just stop talking about this stuff right now? Justice Scalia snapped at Justice Kennedy. Ive told you all how I feel about this topic, and I dont understand why were going on and on about it unless you all hate me. As the courtroom froze in dead silence, Justice Scalia seemed to gather steam, shouting, For two days, its been gay this, gay that. Youre all just talking about this stuff as if its the most normal thing in the world. Well, its not, O.K.? Its weird and its wrong. And just talking about it like its O.K. and whatnot is making me angry beyond belief. As the other justices averted their eyes, Justice Scalia broke down, sobbing that he wished things were normal, the way they used to be. "
0,"Well, it looks like science has done it again. NASA officials announced today that a manned spacecraft they recently sent into orbit has returned safely to Earth, bringing back with it a different man than the one who was originally on board. Wow. Science FTW! Eleven days ago, we sent astronaut Michael McCullough into space, said NASA spokesperson George Diller at a press conference earlier this morning. On Tuesday, McCulloughs spacecraft, Phoenix 2, returned to Earth, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of Florida. When the capsule was opened, a man who is not Michael McCullough was discovered inside. What a breakthrough! So. Awesome. Oh, and in case youre skeptical, NASA officials said they also ran extensive DNA testing on the man who returned in Phoenix 2, confirming with 99 percent accuracy that he is not the man they originally sent into orbit. At a time when NASAs budget seems to be perpetually shrinking, something like this offers hope that Americas elected officials will realize just how important and necessary the space program really is. We maintained contact with McCullough the entire time he was in orbit, but the man who returned to Earth is not him, Diller said. Currently, the whereabouts of Michael McCullough are unknown. Incredible. Is there anything science cant do? Well let you know if something comes upbut dont hold your breath! "

The latest major win for inclusivity comes with a classic book series getting a much-needed upgrade for the 21st century: The Wheres Waldo? books are being reprinted with a faint odor added to Waldo so the blind can finally find him! Its about time! We wanted to do something that made sure that blind children can enjoy the Wheres Waldo? books just as much as every sighted child, said a spokeswoman for book publisher Little, Brown and Company. Its so exciting to introduce Waldo to a whole new segment of fans. But dont think that its going to be any easier for the blind kids. Every effort has been made to make finding Waldo just as tough for them as it is for the sighted. The clay-like scent emanating from Waldo is very faint, so blind children will have to sniff around the pages just as long as sighted kids have to look before finding Waldo. And even better, the characters who closely resemble Waldo all have an extremely similar scent added to them to throw the blind off his trail. Wow! What an incredible victory for inclusivity! What do you think? Are you going to pick up a new Wheres Waldo? book for a blind child in your life? Tweet or Facebook us and let us know! "
0,"The Vatican has confirmed that while Pope Francis was in Washington, he had meetings with people who refuse to do their jobs. The Pope met privately with the Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, and also met at the U.S. Capitol with several hundred other people who have chosen not to perform their duties, the Vatican said. Reporting every day to a job that one has no intention of doing can only fill one with anguish, the official Vatican statement read. The Pope wanted to show these people compassion. While in Washington, the Pope had hoped to meet with thousands of additional people who do not do their jobs, but there wasnt enough time, the Vatican said.

0,"In the battle against ISIS, the U.S. just scored perhaps its biggest symbolic victory yet. According to Col. Steven Warren, a spokesman for the U.S.led coalition against the Islamic State, the man widely known as the Umpire of ISIS was likely killed late last week in a targeted drone strike. A powerful public figure in the militant group, the Umpire of ISIS was a frequent and chilling presence in its brutal propaganda videos, stooping silently in the background in full umpire gear as hostages were executed. We are reasonably certain that we killed our intended target, who was a major tactical figure in ISIS recruiting efforts, Col. Warren said in a statement. We definitely killed an umpire. Hopefully, well get confirmation soon that this was 100 percent our guy. U.S. military intelligence officials say they were alerted to the Umpire of ISIS location by a resident of the ISIS-occupied city of Raqqa who saw the famed militant standing motionlessly in the courtyard of a rumored jihadi safehouse for eight uninterrupted hours. A U.S. senior commander authorized a drone strike shortly thereafter, and the next morning, a surveillance satellite was able to procure a distinct image of a mangled umpire mask amidst the rubble, all but confirming that the U.S. Hellfire missiles had succeeded in hitting their target. While the Umpire may have only been one ISIS member out of tens of thousands, he was a prominent symbol of the groups public image, and his death will hopefully serve as a crushing blow to the terrorist groups morale.

If youve ever wondered what the presidents wife looks like, weve got you covered. This is Michelle Obama, the woman behind the most powerful man in the world: Thats right: This is the woman who locked down Barack Obama himself! And well say it right nowif you were expecting a model or a politician, thats just not his style. So, just who is the presidents other half? Well, from what we know, shes not just a pretty face. She went to Harvard Law School, shes 511, and they met while working at the same law firm. Looks like it takes someone really special to marry the commander-in-chief! Amazing!

0,"Two days after the release of an unusually strong jobs report, prominent Republicans appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows to question President Obamas suspicious motives for repairing the economy. When there have been so many months of job growth, it does make you wonder what hes up to, said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). You add in the rising stock market and falling gas prices, and the whole thing doesnt pass the smell test. Appearing on Fox News, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused the President of cynically fixing the economy to distract the American people. This country faces serious problems, and I dont think they can be swept under the rug by creating prosperity, he said. But the sternest rebuke came from House Speaker John Boehner, who warned, If President Obama doesnt stop fixing the economy, Congress has ways to make him stop. If the President thinks he can fool the American people by putting them back to work and raising their wages, hes headed for a rude awakening, he said. "

According to sources familiar with the size and scope of the collection, which is believed to be the largest in Asia, the mercurial Kim began assembling it when he was either eight or nine. In Washington, an intelligence source reported that satellite photos have confirmed thousands of Transformers massing on the southern border: We are seeing no Autobots. Just tons and tons of Decepticons. Kim himself confirmed the Transformers mobilization today on state television, announcing, I am Megatron, followed by an unintelligible roar. The latest development in North Korea follows published reports that Kim Jong-un may be trying to obtain a light sabre. "
0,"With a fall Presidential contest between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney seeming increasingly likely, Americas bigots are finding themselves in a quandary over which candidate to support, prominent bigots confirmed today. Across the U.S., voters who describe themselves as bigots are complaining that a first-ever matchup between a black man and a Mormon, while historic, is forcing them to ask a difficult question: Which group do they hate more? Ive always seen myself as pretty versatile, bigotry-wise, said Herb Torlinson, a hardware salesman from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. But I guess this is going to be an election that really puts my different hates to the test. At the Clapboard Corner Caf in Youngstown, Ohio, a group of bigots who gather for breakfast once a week to discuss their dislike of various racial and religious groups echoed Mr. Torlinsons sentiments. I actually cried when Rick Perry dropped out of the race, said David Colehurn, a disgruntled hater who works at a nearby Pep Boys. He may be brain-damaged and all, but at least hes white and Christian. Mr. Colehurn said that his bigotry toward both black people and Mormons was making him entertain thoughts of voting for a third-party candidate, but that he was turned off by the possibility of a bid from Texas Congressman Ron Paul: I hate old people. In other political news, former Senator Rick Santorum revealed that he made his first sweater vest himself when he tore off the sleeves of his straitjacket. "
0,"With six fingers of Johnnie Walker swirling in his favorite tumbler, John Boehner speaks with the quiet assurance of a man on the brink of something big. Just three workdays remain until Congress packs it in for 2013, and the House that Boehner presides over is about to set the record for the least productive year in its historya quixotic goal that the tawny Ohioan set for himself when he arrived in Washington, in 1991. Like most of us, I came to this town hoping to make history, he says, refilling his tumbler. And, damn it, thats what Im about to do. Downing his glass in one gulp, he reflects upon all the little things that had to go right to make the year of epic underachievement possible. There were the Benghazi hearings, of course, and all the votes to repeal Obamacare, he says. But when we shut down the government in the fall, I started thinking, Jesus, the recordit could happen. During those heady shutdown days, Boehner didnt dare speak about the record he had long dreamed of settingdidnt want to jinx anythingbut with Congresss work year set to end on Friday, he now admits, Im so close I can taste it. Yesterday, when members of his caucus came up with a bipartisan budget deal, Boehner had a little come-to-Jesus meeting with them, he says. I told them, Ive worked too long and hard for this record, damn it. Dont mess it up at the last minute by accomplishing something. So with the record for worst Congress seemingly in the bagI can cross that off my bucket list, he sayswhat does John Boehner do for an encore? Its going to be tough to make next years Congress even worse, he says, pouring himself another tall one. But its going to be fun trying. "
0,"Youve probably seen a lot of eerily similar celebrity doppelgngers on the internet, but Nicholas Gifford takes it to a whole other level. One glance at his face and its obvious that he looks exactly like the War Rig from Mad Mad: Fury Road! Youre probably thinking that Nicholas set out to mimic Imperator Furiosas battle truck, but nope, its just a bizarre coincidence. If you check out his Facebook page, you can tell that hes appeared this way at least as far back as 2004, when he joined the social media site, a full 11 years before Fury Road hit theaters. For all we know, Nicholas hasnt even seen Mad Max yet and is confused when strangers shout What a lovely day! at him. According to his LinkedIn, Nicholas is currently employed as a warehouse manager at Staples. But if he ever gets tired of that profession, he could probably line up a steady gig taking photos with people on the convention circuit. What movie fan wouldnt shell out $20 to snap a pic with Mr. Rig himself? Director George Miller, if youre putting a truck in the next Mad Max sequel, weve got three words for you: Cast this man! "
0,"Citing the deteriorating situation in the war-torn nation, Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) on Saturday called for Congress to convene an emergency blame game on Iraq. This is a dire crisis, McCain said. Its time to roll up our sleeves and do some serious finger-pointing. McCain said that he hoped Congress would act swiftly to assign blame to a long list of culprits he identified, including President Obama, the Joint Chiefs, the media, and everyone who did not vote for him in the 2008 election. The Arizona senator stressed that the blame game must be rigorous and far-reaching, but said that it would exempt those in the Senate who voted to invade Iraq in 2003. Thats ancient history, he said. Concluding his remarks, he offered these words of reassurance to the Iraqi people: As long as I have breath, I will use it to find fault with others. Photograph by Allison Shelley/Getty. "
0,"President Obama is about to issue an executive order that would force all Americans to purchase a monthly supply of marijuana, the Fox News Channel reported today. According to Foxs Sean Hannity, who broke the story, Obamas initiative is part of a broader plan to make weed available and affordable to every individual in the United States. Under Obamas plan, every American would be required to purchase a government-mandated amount of marijuana per month or face a penalty of up to two thousand dollars. Hannity said that the President hopes to have the mandatory marijuana plan up and running by 2015, but theyre still working on the Web site. Appearing on Fox, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) took issue with Obamas recent remark that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol: I saw that as an insult. "
0,"In the aftermath of the fiscal-cliff deal, Republicans in Congress issued a heartfelt apology to the top 1.5 per cent richest people in America, offering messages of profound condolence for allowing their taxes to increase slightly. Our hearts go out to them, said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), still teary-eyed after hanging up the phone with a multimillionaire in Orange County, California. We came to Washington to do the work of 1.5 per cent of the American people, and we didnt get it done. The House Speaker said that he had spoken to several members of the top 1.5 per cent who were understandably despondent over seeing their taxes rise marginally as a result of the deal: Some of them were so upset they even considered moving to Canada, until they found out the taxes were higher there. Mr. Boehner said that he tried to offer the wealthy consolation by reminding them that because of an increase in payroll taxes, millions of middle-class and working-class Americans would be suffering more than they would: That usually put them in a better mood. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) assailed the fiscal-cliff legislation today, calling it a classic example of putting 98.5 per cent of the American people ahead of the rest of the country. Offering words of hope to the top 1.5 per cent, Mr. Cantor said, In a few months well have the next debate about the debt ceiling. As God is my witness, we will try to do a better job of bringing this nation to the brink of Armageddon. But to billionaires such as Harland Dorrinson, a longtime super-donor to the G.O.P., such assurances ring hollow: If the fiscal-cliff deal is the kind of performance we can expect from Republican politicians, whats the point of owning them?

0," By a five-to-four vote, the Supreme Court today acted, in the words of Justice Antonin Scalia, to relieve millions of Americans from the onerous burden of having to vote. Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia stated, Since 1965, citizens across the nation have lived under the tyranny of being forced to elect people to represent them. This is an important step to free them from that unfair and heinous obligation. Justice Scalia added that the Voting Rights Act had thrust upon the shoulders of millions of Americans the terrible and unwanted burden of exercising their rights in a democracy. Many of them have been forced to drive to polling places, wait in line, and then cast their vote because of the oppressive requirements of this Act, he wrote. It is our honor and duty to free them from those hardships. In conclusion, Justice Scalia wrote, Our message today to the American people is simple: we are voting so you wont have to. "
0," A thorough fact checking reveals that Wednesday nights Republican Presidential debate was four per cent fact, fact checkers reported Thursday morning. According to HonestyWatch, a Minnesota-based fact-checking organization, over the course of three hours the Republican candidates served up between eight and twelve facts, not including their names and job descriptions. While few of the facts that were dispensed during the debate related to policy matters, viewers did learn that Jeb Bush smoked pot in high school, and that Donald Trump had not yet ridiculed Rand Pauls looks, the fact checkers found. At CNN, the debate moderator, Jake Tapper, said he was proud of the role he played in keeping the evenings fact content to a minimum. Whenever I felt the candidates were straying into the issues, I tried to goad them into insulting each other, he said. I didnt succeed every time, but all in all I feel good about the night. While Tapper might be happy with Wednesdays contest, it failed to match the benchmark set by Augusts Fox News debate, which came in at three per cent fact.

From what I understand, theres nothing that the uterus doesnt know, Rep. Akin told a reporter on KTVI-TV.

Akin said that given the uterus extraordinary powers of detection, the female reproductive system should be Americas secret weapon in the war on terror. If we posted a uterus at every airport and a bunch of them along the border, I would just love to see an evildoer get past defenses like that, he said. Not gonna happen, folks. Nothing fools a uterus. Rep. Akin closed his interview with what he called the highest praise and respect for the female reproductive system. Not a day goes by that I dont wish I was as smart as a uterus, he said. "
0,"There are growing fears among supporters of the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump that his new focus on Muslims is distracting him from his campaign against Mexicans. After the billionaire said he would consider shutting down mosques if he were President, supporters expressed concern that such signature proposals as a wall with Mexico and mass deportations were being lost in the shuffle. Carol Foyler, who viewed a recent Trump appearance on television, said that she was alarmed to hear him talk about closing mosques without mentioning the wall with Mexico even once. I just worry, I guess, that with all of this talk about Muslims hes really forgetting about Mexicans, she said. It feels kind of like a bait-and-switch. Another Trump supporter, Harland Dorrinson, agreed. Shutting down the mosques is a great idea, sure, but he shouldnt do that if its going to divert resources from forcibly deporting eleven million immigrants, he said. I would be very sad to see that happen. But Tracy Klugian, a die-hard Trump volunteer who is working for his campaign in Iowa, called such criticism of her candidate misguided.

In the letter, in which he excoriates Goldman and its practices, Mr. Smith comes across as a man of conscience, ideals, and high moral standards. And as you read his words, you no doubt asked yourself this troubling question: how could Goldman have hired such a person? At Goldman, we pride ourselves on our ability to scour the worlds universities and business schools for the finest sociopaths money will buy. Once in our internship program, these youths are subjected to rigorous evaluations to root out even the slightest evidence of a soul. But, as the case of Mr. Smith shows, even the most time-tested system for detecting shreds of humanity can blow a gasket now and then. For that, we can only offer you our deepest apology and the reassurance that one good apple wont spoil the whole bunch. As to those of you who were serviced by Mr. Smith, its understandable that you would be concerned about who will be taking his place going forward. On that front, I have some exciting news: today, Goldman is pleased to announce that our new executive director and head of the United States equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will be Mr. Joseph Kony. For those unfamiliar with Mr. Konys rsum, let me assure you that he has the character and moral standards you have come to expect from Goldman, and like the rest of us here at the bank, he has dedicated his life to doing the Lords work.

Appearing on Fox News Sunday, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. denied that spreading misinformation about Planned Parenthood was in any way incendiary, but added, What is truly incendiary is demanding that someone who is seeking the highest office in the land stop lying. Fiorina noted that many of her rivals for the Republican nominationincluding Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Ted Cruzhad successfully used lying as a key element of their campaign strategies. All I am trying to do is level the playing field, she said. Additionally, she argued that she had not singled out Planned Parenthood as the subject of falsehoods during her campaign. Look at the things I have said about my tenure at Hewlett-Packard, she said. I have steadfastly avoided facts from day one. Striking a defiant note, she said that she refused to allow a tiny cabal of left-wing truth-fetishists break her resolve. Anyone who thinks Im going to start suddenly telling the truth doesnt know what Carly Fiorina is made of, she said. "
0,"Presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed a little-known episode of personal heroism from his youth on Saturday, telling an Iowa audience that he narrowly avoided capture in Vietnam by remaining in the United States for the duration of the war. The Cong were after me, Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment. The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because I dont like to boast. He said that he only disclosed the episode now because the way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace. Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition shameful. Those brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at allwe are the true heroes, he said. Trumps tale of valor appeared to move many members of his audience, some of whom waited in line after his speech to thank him for his lack of service. "
0,"Republicans who were angered to learn on Wednesday that the former I.R.S. official Lois Lerner had referred to them as crazies and assholes responded later in the day by voting to sue the President of the United States. Calling us crazy assholes is insulting, derogatory, and beneath contempt, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters. And now if youll excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I have to go sue Obama. Determined to burnish their reputation as extremely sane people who are not assholes at all, House Republicans in their lawsuit accuse the President of coldly and arrogantly seizing power granted to him by the United States Constitution. The lawsuit alleges that having signed 181 executive orders to date, Barack Obama seems intent on chasing the records of such notorious renegades as Dwight Eisenhower (484) and Theodore Roosevelt (1,081).

0,"The international terror group known as Al Qaeda announced its dissolution today, saying that our mission of destroying the American economy is now in the capable hands of the U.S. Congress. In an official statement published on the groups website, the current leader of Al Qaeda said that Congresss conduct during the so-called fiscal-cliff showdown convinced the terrorists that they had been outdone. Weve been working overtime trying to come up with ways to terrorize the American people and wreck their economy, said the statement from Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. But even we couldnt come up with something like this. Mr. al-Zawhiri said that the idea of holding the entire nation hostage with a clock ticking down to the end of the year is completely insane and worthy of a Bond villain. As terrorists, every now and then you have to step back and admire when someone else has beaten you at your own game, he said. This is one of those times. The Al Qaeda leader was fulsome in his praise for congressional leaders, saying, We have made many scary videos in our time but none of them were as terrifying as Mitch McConnell. As for the future of Al Qaeda, the statement said that it would no longer be a terror network but would become more of a social network, offering reviews of new music, movies and video games. In its first movie review, Al Qaeda gave the film Zero Dark Thirty two thumbs down. "

Netflix has confirmed that our favorite boy genius will be back this spring with more wild adventures and wacky inventions, assuming nobody has a better idea in the meantime. We cant wait to see Jimmy, his robotic dog, Goddard, and the rest of the gang one more time, but if someone comes up with an idea to top that, well probably be on board with that too!

0," In a development that few had thought possible, Republicans in the Seventh District of Virginia on Tuesday night found an even bigger tool than Rep. Eric Cantor to represent them in the United States Congress. Apparently deciding that Cantor was insufficiently heartless to represent their district, Republicans turned out to the polls to elect David Brat, a man whose political views border on sociopathy, according to exit-poll responses from voters who supported him. During his concession speech, Rep. Cantor reflected on the mistakes that might have led to his defeat: Should I have cut more school-lunch programs for poor children? Perhaps. Should I have cast more votes to screw over disaster victims? Definitely. Should I have not said the thing about treating children of immigrants like human beings? Man, do I wish I could take that one back. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, but at the end of the day I was just too damn empathic for this district. But Rep. Cantor was gracious in defeat, offering words of congratulation to the victorious Mr. Brat. The people of the Seventh District have spoken, he said. The time has come to pass the torch to a new generation of asshats. When asked about the defeat of his longtime colleague in the House, Speaker John Boehner said, I will give a formal statement as soon as I can stop laughing. "

At a hastily called press conference this afternoon, the Texas Governor made an emotional appeal to Washingtonians who might be disappointed by the sudden suspension of executions in their state: Come to Texas. The death penalty is alive and well here. Blasting Governor Inslee, he reassured Washington residents that if they move to Texas, as God is my witness, no one will ever take your death penalty away from you. Thats just not what were made of in Texas, he said. We believe in the sanctity of death. Photograph of Rick Perry by Spartanburg Herald Journal/Michael Justus/AP. "

Speaking to reporters in Baghdad on Wednesday, Abadi said that he had been looking forward to visiting the White House but that recent reports had given me the willies. They really need to get on top of things there, he said. Until they do, Im better off staying in Iraq.

0,"In a dramatic narrative that could upstage this weeks Democratic National Convention, Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.) gave reporters today a detailed account of the fateful day he killed Osama bin Laden. Mr. Ryan said that he was revealing his role as the triggerman who felled the Al Qaeda leader to set the record straight, explaining that he had remained silent about his mission until now, because I dont like to brag. The Republican Vice-Presidential nominee painted a portrait of a Paul Ryan few know, a man who trained for missions with SEAL Team Six while somehow finding time to cut key provisions of Medicare. The Wisconsin Congressman said he was doing sit-ups in the House of Representatives cloakroom when he got the call to deploy for his mission to Abbottabad, and hours later found himself face to face with the worlds most wanted man. Osama got one look at me and he ran like a bat out of hell, he said. Its times like that that Im glad I can run a hundred meters in 9.58 seconds. As for the perfect shot between the eyes that nailed bin Laden, Mr. Ryan called it just another day at the office. You dont want to get too full of yourself because of a thing like this, he said. I had a job to do, and I did it. It was very satisfying to see all my SEAL training come together. And it was great practice for the day I got Qaddafi. "

We Republicans have worked long and hard to develop insidious racial code words like entitlement society and personal responsibility, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). There is no excuse for offensive racist comments like the ones Cliven Bundy made when there are so many subtler ways of making the exact same point. Fox News also blasted the rancher, saying in a statement, Cliven Bundys outrageous racist remarks undermine decades of progress in our effort to come up with cleverer ways of saying the same thing. "
0,"In what many in Washington are calling a final indignity, a group of White House fence jumpers announced on Wednesday that it no longer has any interest in trespassing on President Obamas living quarters. The news came from a spokesman for the fence jumpers, Taggart Wentzel, the author of a four-hundred-page anti-government manifesto who has been arrested for jumping the White House fence three times since Obama moved in. We have no plans to jump the White House fence in the future, said Wentzel. Were moving on. Explaining the groups decision, Wentzel said, It just seems like everyone in the White House is going to be sad a lot of the time. Its kind of mean to intrude on people like that. Wentzel said that the group was actively investigating whether there was any barrier around Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnells office, and, if so, wed definitely consider jumping that. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest criticized the fence jumpers decision, calling it premature. Were still going to be here another two years, doing a lot of important stuff, Earnest told reporters. All were asking is that the fence jumpers give us another chance. "
0,"Today, President Obama issued the following letter to all Verizon customers: Dear Verizon Customers, Yesterday it came to light that the National Security Agency has been collecting millions of phone records from you each and every day. Since that news was released, many of you have called the White House with questions and concerns about this new program. To save my time and yours, here are answers to three of the F.A.Q.s (Frequently Asked Questions) weve been hearing from you: 1. Will I be charged extra for this service? Im happy to say that the answer is no. While the harvesting and surveillance of your domestic phone calls were not a part of your original Verizon service contract, the National Security Agency is providing this service entirely free of charge. 2. If I add a phone to my account, will those calls also be monitored? Once again, the answer is good news. If you want to add a child or any other family member to your Verizon account, their phone callswhom they called, when, and the duration of the callwill all be monitored by the United States government, at no additional cost. 3. Can the National Security Agency help me understand my Verizon bill? Unfortunately, no. The National Security Agency has tried, but failed, to understand Verizons bills. Please call Verizon customer service and follow the series of electronic prompts. I hope Ive helped clear up some of the confusion about this exciting new program. But if you have any further questions, please dont hesitate to call the White House. Joe Biden is standing by. God bless America, President Obama "
0,"The race for the White House will most likely be wide open after Hillary Clinton serves her two terms as President, experts agree. What happens in 2024 is anyones guessand if anyone tells you differently, theyre lying, says political science professor Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota. The only thing we can say with any certainty is that Hillary Clinton will be elected President by a landslide in 2016 and relected by an even bigger margin in 2020. Mr. Logsdon says that possible Republican Presidential candidates in 2024 could include Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with this caveat: If any of those men have the misfortune of running against Hillary in 2016 or 2020, she will defeat them so soundly that their political careers will be finished and they will vanish from public life forever. As for the future of the Democratic Party after Hillarys two terms are over, Mr. Logsdon offers this prediction: I can tell you right now that Hillarys Presidency will be so successful that she will usher in a Democratic dynasty of sorts. Im not a betting man, but if I had to guess, Id say that after eight years of Hillary there will be eight years of Michelle, then eight years each for Chelsea, Sasha, and Malia. But not so fast, says Democratic strategist Tracy Klugian, who believes such predictions sell Hillary short: Assuming her current poll numbers hold up in 2024, I think its safe to say that Hillary Clinton will be the most popular President in U.S. history. In that event, the Twenty-second Amendment, which limits the President to two terms, will be repealed and Hillary will run again. Mr. Logsdon, however, scoffs at that scenario: If the Twenty-second Amendment is repealed, Bill will run again. "
0,"The National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre today defended his decision to purchase the former congressman Asa Hutchinson, after an outspoken N.R.A. member complained that the organization should be using its funds to buy current congressmen only. Shortly after Mr. Hutchinson appeared at a press conference in Washington to present the N.R.A.s plan to arm teachers and other school personnel, N.R.A. dissident Tracy Klugian blasted the purchase of the former Arkansas representative. Members of the N.R.A. fork over millions of dollars to this organization, he said. That money should be used to buy people who are actually in Congress now, not some has-been like Hutchinson who doesnt even have a vote anymore. Mr. Klugian said that as he watched former Rep. Hutchinson at the podium, It made my blood boil, especially when I thought about all of the current congressmen out there who are totally for sale. Not long after Mr. Klugian made his comments, Mr. LaPierre pushed back: The purchase of Asa Hutchinson did not and will not prevent the N.R.A. from buying a single additional congressman in the future. Period. While refusing to divulge the purchase price for Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. LaPierre reassured the N.R.A. membership, We got a very good deal on Asa. There wasnt exactly a bidding war. In a separate statement, Mr. Hutchinson said, A free and lively exchange of views is what makes the N.R.A. such a great organizationand is why Im so proud to be owned by it. "
0," President Obama is under increasing pressure to work closely and coperatively with a group of people who are suing him in federal court, the people suing him confirmed today. Over the past six years, President Obama has been stubborn, arrogant, and oppositional, John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, said. His refusal to work with people who are suing him is just the latest example. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, echoed the Speakers criticism, adding, Time and time again, the President has refused to pick up the phone and talk to me, despite my saying that I was doing everything in my power to make him a one-term President. Other members of the G.O.P. caucus blasted the President for being aloof and frosty to Republicans who had questioned his American citizenship, the authenticity of his birth certificate, and the legitimacy of his Presidency. Thats no way to get things done, Senator James Inhofe, of Oklahoma, said. Hes got a real attitude. Boehner concluded his comments, however, with an olive branch of sorts for Obama. Mr. President, we Republicans are eager to sit across the table from you and get to work for the American people, he said. Otherwise, get ready to be impeached. "
0,"House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) unveiled an ambitious plan on Thursday to avoid making eye contact with outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) until Rep. Cantor leaves Congress, in January of 2015. Speaking to reporters, Boehner acknowledged the difficulty of avoiding eye contact with the Virginia Republican for the next seven months, but he stressed the importance of his new plan. If I make eye contact with him, he might misconstrue that to mean that I want to talk to him, Boehner said. And, lets be honest, none of us has to do that anymore. The House Speaker said that the success of his plan depended largely on avoiding places Cantor might be. Fortunately, neither of us is in the office very often, so that should make it easier, he said. Boehner ended his remarks abruptly when he saw Cantor coming down the hall and darted into a janitors closet. Photograph by Chip Somodevilla/Getty. "

In its entirety, the argument read as follows: Were strongly opposed to FEMA and health care, but basically O.K. with rape. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that the Partys message of zero tolerance toward disaster relief combined with a more easygoing attitude about rape would lead the Party to victory on Election Day. Our argument couldnt be simpler: when God wants to create a hurricane or make a woman pregnant, big government should get out of the way, he said. The Party chairman said that the closing argument was part of its expand the map strategy: Were contesting every state, from Pennsylvania to Colorado to Iowa, where we believe there are voters who are in sync with our more advanced view of hurricanes and rape. Mr. Priebus also had this message for the American voter: Your vote is important. Weve spent billions trying to buy it. "

Like a lot of American families, we Palins had big plans and dreamsin this case, regarding me becoming Vice-President, she said. But you know who had to go and ruin those plans and dreams? President Obama. Palin said that Obama insured her defeat in 2008 just like he has defeated so many other great Americans, and that her family had paid the price. I cant help thinking that, if I had been elected Vice-President, Bristol and Willow wouldnt have gotten into that drunken brawl and Track wouldnt have threatened his girlfriend and whatnot, she said. Thanks, Obama. Trump, who appeared with Palin at the rally, stepped offstage after a few minutes, explaining to reporters that he could only take that voice for so long.

Clinton gave no outward appearance of compiling such a list as she answered questions relating to her tenure as Secretary of State, the aide said, but was busy assembling the list nonetheless. This is the kind of multitasking that she is very good at, he said. Believe me, the entire time she was talking, she was working very hard on that list. In response to reporters questions, the aide said that there was no firm timetable for Clinton to destroy the people on her list. She will wait for the appropriate time, the aide said, and she will crush them. The aide would neither confirm nor deny that Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, was at the top of Clintons list.

Sterling acknowledged that he had turned a blind eye to a mountain of criticism from basketball luminaries and national leaders, but said that seeing Trump defend him on Fox News on Monday had left him shaken.

The jaw-dropping confession occurred just minutes into the hearing, after Chairman Fred Upton (R-Michigan) asked Secretary Sebelius about some of the functions of the site, causing her to respond, I dont feel comfortable talking about a Web site that Ive never actually gotten onto. Continuing to address the visibly stunned committee members, she said, Ive tried to log on to it, I dont know, maybe twenty times or so, but every time I have its crashed. I tried again right before I came over here, but no such luck.

You wouldnt know it from looking at him, but Evan is a hero. And hes doing his part to help the world in a really special way: Whenever Evan hears about a terrorist attack happening somewhere, he shakes his head. Inspiring! Any time Evan hears about a bombing in Kabul or a shooting in Jerusalem, he immediately stops whatever hes doing and solemnly shakes his head from side to side while letting out a brief, mournful sigh. Depending on the severity of the attack, he sometimes even says Goddammit or Not again. A humble hero determined to make a difference in whatever way he can! Evan might not be the kind of hero who gets lots of awards and attention, but his selfless dedication to shaking his head sadly and looking somber for a few seconds whenever anyone talks about people dying in a terrorist attack is certainly something we can all respect. What an incredible man. Thanks for doing your part, Evan! You set a great example for all Americans. "
0,"Visiting Thomas Jeffersons historic home, Monticello, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin today paid tribute to the nations third President, telling an audience of supporters, We must never forget the wisdom of Jefferson, and his wife, Weezy. Governor Palin said that at a time of our history when the American people needed leadership, it was Jefferson who said the immortal words, Were movin on up. The former Alaska Governor, criticized in recent days over her grasp of American history, used the Monticello speech to demonstrate her knowledge of the countrys founding fathers. Let us have the ingenuity of Benjamin Franklin, who invented the electric chair, she said. Let us have the honesty of George Washington, who told his father that he chopped down a cherry tree because it was blocking his view of Russia, she added. And let us have Washingtons perseverance, which he demonstrated during that harsh winter at Sweet Valley High. But she saved her most fulsome praise for her favorite American hero, Paul Revere: In his famous cry, One if by land, two if by sea, Paul Revere proved that you dont have to know how to count higher than two to be a great American. At the end of her speech in Monticello, Governor Palin said that she was looking forward to the next stop on her bus tour, Philadelphia, the home of the Taco Bell. "

So when Jonathan was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, his family reached out to the tennis superstar in hopes of arranging a phone call to lift the boys spirits. But to everyones surprise, Serena Williams responded in a much bigger way: She promised to grunt Jonathans name every time she hits a tennis ball this year. Simply beautiful. After hearing Jonathans story, Williams announced in a post-match interview that she would honor this brave young fan by grunting Jonathan! whenever she strikes a tennis ball. That means not just once every match, or just once every point, but every time her racket makes contact with a ball for the remainder of the season! Jonathan didnt have to wait long. Williams just put her plan into action at a recent exhibition match, grunting Jonathans name on every serve, volley, and groundstroke of her 6-2, 6-0 victory over Germanys Carina Witthoeft, including a 32-shot baseline exchange that had fans on their feet. At one point, Williams even shouted Jonathan! at the line judge to officially challenge a cross-court volley that was mistakenly called wide. Wow. What a world-class gesture. And its only just the beginning, as Williams confirmed that she intends to grunt Jonathans name on every shot of each of the three remaining Grand Slams of 2016, beginning with the French Open in May. Nothing warms our hearts like seeing celebrities use their influence to do something good. Other players better start taking notes; this is how you give back to a fan in need. "
0,"In a feat that some observers called nothing short of miraculous, the embattled pharmaceuticals C.E.O. Martin Shkreli single-handedly made the American people side with Congress on Thursday morning. According to polls taken after his appearance before the despised legislative body, Shkrelis smug, smirking, and utterly douchey performance had the effect of temporarily transforming members of Congress into marginally sympathetic figures. The University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, which tracks the American peoples attitudes toward the legislative branch, said that after Shkrelis appearance Congresss approval rating surged from eleven per cent to fourteen per cent. A three-per-cent gain may not seem like a lot, but I think everyone in Congress is popping champagne corks today, Davis Logsdon, the pollster who supervised the survey, said. Martin Shkreli is the best thing to happen to Congress in years. Shortly after the hearing concluded, a congressional spokesman announced that Congress plans to hold an additional twenty to thirty hearings with Shkreli in the immediate future.

Speaking to reporters in his office in Indianapolis, Pence said that he made the astonishing discovery about gay friends late last week. A lot of everyday people have gay friends, and theyre not afraid to call and/or e-mail you to tell you that, Pence said. To be honest, Im still trying to process it all. Pence said that from what he has been able to gather thus far, the phenomenon of ordinary folks having gay friends has been going on for years. You could be walking down the street, and without you knowing it, this person is friends with gays and that person is, too, he said. It really seems to be pretty widespread. Its the darnedest thing, he added. While Pence acknowledged that he has no gay friends personally, the growing popularity of being friends with gays has made him question whether he has been missing the boat on this. When I see so many people having gay friends, it makes me wonder if I should go out and get one, he said. But I guess that would be kind of hard for me to do now. "

All 1,003 locations worldwide have been exposed as part of a gigantic prank, and if youve ever eaten one of their doughnuts, then you fell for it. Big time. There are hoaxes, and then theres this. Just wow. When reports of the scam first hit the web, we held out hope that they werent true, but sadly, Snopes has weighed in and confirmed that Krispy Kreme isnt real: Its all been a trickevery single doughnut, cruller, and cinnamon twist. Even their coffee, Kool Kreme soft serve, and every employee that ever worked in a Krispy Kreme store, factory, or corporate office was part of the deception. Since the first Krispy Kreme location opened in 1937, the con artists behind the so-called doughnut company have been getting us to lower our guard, and they had everybody fooled. In retrospect, its embarrassing that the public could even be this gullible. Nobody has claimed credit for the prank yet, and people are speculating that the culprits could be anyone from internet trolls to a viral marketing campaign. Wed be mad, but you have to admit that its pretty impressive that they kept us going for so long. To whoever is behind the Krispy Kreme hoax, all we can say is, well played. Well played, indeed. "
0,"Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is gaining legions of new admirers by shamelessly pandering to voters who want to hear the truth, critics of the Vermont senator say. According to those critics, Sanders has cynically targeted so-called truth-based voters to build support for his Presidential bid. People come to Sanderss rallies expecting to hear the truth, and he serves it up to them on a silver platter, the political strategist Harland Dorrinson said. Its a very calculated gimmick. But while Sanderss practice of relentlessly telling the truth might play well in states that are rich in truth-based voters, like the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, critics say that his campaign could stall in states where the truth has historically been less important, like Florida. At some point in this campaign, voters are going to get truth fatigue, Dorrinson said. Right now, the novelty of a politician who doesnt constantly spew lies is grabbing headlines. But after months of Bernie Sanders telling the truth, voters are going to start wondering, Is that all hes got? Dorrinson is just one of many critics who is eagerly waiting for the Sanders phenomenon to come down to Earth. Telling the truth may be working for Bernie Sanders, but it shows a serious lack of respect for the American political system, he said. Watch: Life as a busker in New York City. "
0,"Just minutes after the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped out of the Republican Presidential race, the billionaire Koch brothers demanded that he return the nine hundred million dollars they had allocated to his campaign. For the Koch brothers, who purchased Walker earlier this year, the demand for a full cash refund reflected how badly their relationship with the formerly promising candidate had deteriorated. According to an aide familiar with the phone conversation between Walker and the Kochs, the industrialist brothers were not amused that the Governor had blown through millions of their dollars to become the choice of only one per cent of likely Republican voters. Im not going to sugarcoat it, the aide said. The Kochs were pissed. After tearing into Scott for nearly thirty minutes, the Kochs reportedly demanded that Walker return their money no later than midnight Friday. B-but where am I going to come up with that kind of dough? Walker asked. We dont care how you get it, Scott, the Kochs reportedly said. Just get it. On that note, the aide said, the Kochs hung up the phone, leaving Governor Walker staring out into the middle distance. "

Calling this week by far the worst week of my life, Justice Scalia lashed out at his fellow-Justices and the nation, saying, I dont want to live in a sick, sick country that thinks the way this country apparently thinks. Justice Scalia said that he had considered fleeing to Canada, but they not only have gay marriage but also national health care, which is almost as evil. He said the fact that nations around the world recognizing same-sex marriage are falling like deviant dominoes would not deter him from leaving the United States: There are plenty of other countries that still feel the way I do. Ill move to Iran if I have to. Throwing off his robe in a dramatic gesture, Justice Scalia reserved his harshest parting shot for his fellow-Justices, screaming, Damn you!

0,"A rally featuring a racist speaker Friday night in Mobile attracted a crowd of just twenty thousand people, widely considered a disappointing turnout for a racist event in Alabama. According to racist event planners in the state, a crowd of twenty thousand would rank the event as one of the smaller racist rallies in Alabama this year. Organizers of the rally were quick to defend the size of the turnout. There is always a lot of competition for the racist audience in Alabama, an aide to the speaker said. There were other racists speaking at other venues in the state Friday night. Plus, a lot of racists now prefer to stay at home and stream racist content on the Internet. Given all the options available to racists, I think twenty thousand is a solid number. Harland Dorrinson, a longtime racist event planner in Alabama, disagreed, claiming that the size of the crowd was more reminiscent of non-racist events in the state. You go around spewing hatred every chance you get, and then you only draw twenty thousand in Alabama? he said. The people who organized this event need to sit down and figure out what went wrong.

Cardinal Bonifacius Steuer had been on the shortlist to replace Benedict XVI as Pope, but his fellow cardinals abandoned him after the startling emergence of the photos, which chronicle Steuer on a seventy-two-hour nonstop-party rampage in Florida. In the Facebook photo album, which Cardinal Steuer labeled Tampa Phun, the Dutchman appears at a dizzying array of frat parties and strip clubs, throwing gang signs at the camera and steadily drinking from two Old Milwaukees mounted on a beer hat. Tracy Klugian, a job-placement specialist who helps papal candidates navigate the labyrinthine Pope-selection process, says that Cardinal Steuers downfall should serve as a cautionary tale to all Pope candidates who are active on social media. If youre serious about becoming Pope, look at every single photo youve posted on Facebook and Instagram, Mr. Klugian says. If theres someone on your arm who makes you look fallible, crop them out. While Mr. Klugian believes that the cardinals decision to blackball Steuer was a little harsh, he says that at the end of the day, they couldnt live with pictures out there of a Pope in a funny hat.

0,"Well, this is terrible. According to a report from SeaWorld Orlando, Kunik, one of the young orca whales at the theme park, managed to escape from its tank earlier this week and disappeared. Now, rescue workers believe the orca has managed to drag itself over 600 miles north along the highway and into the woods, where its currently hiding. Escapes are rare at SeaWorld, and by the time Kuniks trainers realized what had happened, it was too late. His trail of moisture had quickly evaporated, but a partially devoured deer carcass near where Route 1 meets I-95 put rescue workers back onto the scent. By following the path of flattened saplings and the occasional chunk of blubber, they were able to track him as far as Raleigh, NC before losing the trail in the thick Carolina woodland. Though SeaWorld staff remain hopeful for Kuniks safe return, its hard to be optimistic. The goings been slow, with a lack of trails forcing rescue workers to search on foot and the thick foliage obscuring him from helicopters. And while Kunik has shown extraordinary tenacity, the delayed response may have cost him precious time. Still, the trail hasnt gone completely cold. A pair of hikers reported spotting him rolling downhill through the underbrush in the vicinity of Fayetteville, NC. Kunik had unfortunately moved on by the time the authorities arrived, but every sighting brings him closer to rescue. A statement released by SeaWorld Entertainment today highlights just how dire the situation is: Everyone here at SeaWorld Orlando hopes to see Kunik back safe and sound soon, and we need all the help we can get. Contact us ASAP with any sightings, but remember: Though he was raised in captivity, our Kunik is still a wild animal! Alone and confused, he may accidentally lash out at even those trying to help him. If you spot him, do not approach him yourself. Instead, please call your local animal control hotline immediately. If you have any information that will help bring him home, contact SeaWorld Orlando at 1-888-800-5447 immediately. Were praying for you, Kunik! "
0,"In a preview of what promises to be a heated race for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2016, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) head-butted his rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on the floor of the United States Senate this morning. The melee came without warning, one observer said, as Sen. Paul took to the well of the Senate to give a speech recommending a strong but measured response to the crisis in Ukraine. Almost immediately, a furious and beet-red Sen. Cruz began heckling Sen. Paul, calling him a Kentucky-fried Communist and demanding that he apologize to Ronald Reagan this very instant. Sen. Paul seemed to ignore the heckling at first, but as Sen. Cruzs taunts descended into a stream of profane name-calling, the Kentuckian leapt from the well of the Senate and began throttling Sen. Cruz before administering the decisive head-butt. Shut up, you bastard! Sen. Paul reportedly shouted during the brawl. Shut up, or Ill make you shut up! A group of horrified senatorsincluding Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.)pulled the two men apart, aided by a C.I.A. agent who had been monitoring the Senates activities at the time. Within moments, the free-for-all was over, but not before more fists were thrown and a gash was opened over Sen. Cruzs left eye. In the aftermath of the skirmish, Sen. Paul seemed pleased with the outcome. Sen. Cruz and I may not always agree, but were both passionate about our views, he said. This kind of debate is healthy for the Republican Party. Under the rules of the Senate, head-butting another senator results in a mandatory suspension of seven days, experts said. "

0,"Dear Friend, And when I say friend, I mean it in the normal way, not someone Ive been sleeping with for thirteen years. Unless, of course, I have been sleeping with you for thirteen years. In that case, I do mean it that way. It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to end my inspirational quest for the White House. After much reassessing and reconsidering, I have decided to spend more time being screamed at by my wife. And by more time, I mean twenty-four hours a day, stopping only for bathroom breaks. But before I go, let me share with you my final thoughts on my campaign. After months of crisscrossing this great land of ours and participating in over three hundred televised debates, I am being disqualified because of an extramarital affair. And that raises the following question: Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, lets get real. I never heard of Libya. I didnt know whether that CNN dudes name was Wolf or Blitz. And my only training for running the No. 1 nation in the world was running its No. 8 pizza chain. Yet none of that, I repeat, none of that disqualified me. In fact, I was the front-fucking-runner, as long as I kept my 9-9-9 in my pants. (I have no idea what I meant by thatI just like saying 9-9-9.) But heres the part that really kills me. Youre kicking me to the curb because I was messing around, and instead youre going with Newt Gingrich? I repeat: Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, I know what youre saying: you love Newt because hes an intellectual. Well, Newt Gingrich is the intellectual of the Republican field the way Moe was the intellectual of the Stooges. And that leads me to my final point: you disgust me, America. Right now if I had my way, Id up and move to another country. I really, truly would. Only I dont know where any of them are, and my wife wont let me leave the house. Goodbye forever, Herman "
0,"Bill Gatess first day at work in the newly created role of technology adviser got off to a rocky start yesterday as the Microsoft founder struggled for hours to install the Windows 8.1 upgrade. The installation hit a snag early on, sources said, when Mr. Gates repeatedly received an error message informing him that his PC ran into a problem that it could not handle and needed to restart. After failing to install the upgrade by lunchtime, Mr. Gates summoned the new Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella, who attempted to help him with the installation, but with no success. While the two men worked behind closed doors, one source described the situation as tense. Bill is usually a pretty calm guy, so it was weird to hear some of that language coming out of his mouth, the source said. A Microsoft spokesman said only that Mr. Gatess first day in his new job had been a learning experience and that, for the immediate future, he would go back to running Windows 7. "
0,"The banking giant Citigroup announced on Friday that it would move its headquarters from New York to the U.S. Capitol Building, in Washington, D.C., in early 2015. Tracy Klugian, a spokesperson for Citi, said that the company had leased thirty thousand square feet of prime real estate on the floor of the House of Representatives and would be interviewing world-class architects to redesign the space to suit its needs. According to sources, Citi successfully outbid other firms, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for the right to move its headquarters to the House floor. The Citi spokesperson acknowledged that the extensive makeover of the House is expected to cost in the millions, but added, Its always expensive to open a new branch. Explaining the rationale behind the move, Klugian told reporters, Instead of constantly flying out from New York to give members of Congress their marching orders, Citigroup executives can be right on the floor with them, handing them legislation and telling them how to vote. This is going to result in tremendous cost savings going forward. Klugian said that Citis chairman, Michael E. ONeill, will not occupy a corner office on the House floor, preferring instead an open plan that will allow him to mingle freely with members of Congress. He doesnt want to come off like hes their boss, the spokesperson said. Basically, he wants to send the message, Were all on the same team. Lets roll up our sleeves and get stuff done. "
0,"Dear American Person: As many of you know, in recent days my opponent has spread the rumors that 1) I have refused to make my tax returns public and 2) I have hidden my money in bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caymans. These two rumors, while true, have made me look very bad. So I thought I would take this opportunity to explain my finances in terms even a poor person could understand. Lets say you met the love of your life, and you wrote her a series of passionate love letters. In these letters, you told her how you intended to protect her, cherish her, and always keep her safe. And then lets say somebody went and told you that you had to make those love letters available for the world to see. If youre even half the man I am, youd say, Heck no. Well, in my case, the love of my life is my money. (If you dont believe me, ask Ann.) And my tax returns are like my love letters to my money, detailing the lengths to which Ill go to keep my precious money from being taken away from me. If you think I should make those love letters public, then Im sorry, my friend, but you dont believe in love. Now, lets say you asked the love of your life to marry you, and youre fortunate enough that she said yes. Should someone be able to force you to spend your honeymoon in a ratty room at some Motel 6, where God knows what crackheads and whores slept before you? Or should you be allowed to take your bride to a five-star Swiss chateau, perhaps, or an exclusive beach on Grand Cayman? I think you can see where Im going with this. In conclusion: if refusing to release my tax returns and having foreign bank accounts is wrong, I dont want to be right. I did it all for love. And as your President, I promise I will never, ever come between you and the thing you love. Unless youre gay. (Laughing Out Loud.) Vote for me, Mitt Romney "
0,"Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world for the second time in twenty-four hours today by announcing his decision to come out of retirement. I thought I was getting too old for this, the Pope explained via his Twitter account, but Ive still got plenty left in the tank. The Popes abrupt unretirement left many fans wondering if his original decision was little more than a publicity stunt, but according to one Vatican source, The situation was a lot more complicated than people know. The Vatican doesnt make resigning your job as Pope an easy thing to do, the source said. In his exit interview, they told him he would have to agree not to sign with another organized religion for three years. Plus, he was going to have to give his 1.5 million Twitter followers back to the Church. The Twitter thing was the deal-breaker. For his part, the newly unretired Pope took to his Twitter feed to announce his return in a nonchalant way: So it turns out Im not infallible. #FTW. Get The selfnews delivered to your inbox.

0,"Responding to Pope Franciss suggestion that the Pope is not capable of judging gays, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia contacted the Vatican today to say that he would be more than happy to help the Pontiff do so. If hes having trouble judging homosexuals, well, then Im his man, Scalia told reporters after making his offer. I have over a quarter century of professional experience. Justice Scalia said that he was sympathetic to Pope Franciss difficulty in judging gays, but added, Once he spends a few weeks watching the master at work, Im sure hell get the hang of it. I wasnt great at judging homosexuals my first year in the job, either, he said. But now I can do it without thinking. Justice Scalia said that once Pope Francis feels confident about his ability to judge gays, he would help the Pontiff learn how to judge minorities and women. "
0,"Its only August, but we may already have the winner of the biggest face-palm of 2015: Earlier this morning, Madame Tussauds in New York City unveiled 35 identical wax statues of former Subway spokesman and self-confessed pedophile Jared Fogle. Yikes. SMH, Madame Tussauds. The timing could not have been worse for Madame Tussauds to open its brand-new exhibit, which features 35 identical likenesses of a man who just one week ago admitted to paying for sex with multiple teenage girls and soliciting child pornography. According to reports, 26 of the Jareds are reportedly displayed in a single exhibition room, while the other nine are spread out throughout the five-floor complexincluding two that are surrounding the President Obama statue. Bet they wish they could get a do-over on this one. An utterly epic fail. While Madame Tussauds was quick to clarify that 32 of the statues were made prior to when the shocking and horrifying news about Fogle was made public, that does little to mitigate the massive PR nightmare the famed wax museum has on its hands. Museum officials have tried to stem the internet-wide negative reaction with this tweet, but many fans have said that its too little, too late: Its unclear what Madame Tussauds is going to have to do to make this one right, but it had better be good! The statues will be on display through January 2016. "
0,"With just hours until Super Tuesday, a new survey of likely voters indicates that in a matchup between former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a majority would choose suicide over either candidate. The poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, shows Mr. Romney drawing twenty-one per cent, Mr. Santorum eighteen per cent, and various forms of suicide sixty-one per cent. Throwing yourself in front of a speeding city bus was the most popular means of suicide, at twenty-two per cent, with jumping off the roof of a really tall building or bridge coming in second, at seventeen per cent. According to pollster Davis Logsdon, the surging popularity of suicide bodes ill for both Governor Romney and Senator Santorum as Presidential candidates in 2012. Its still early, but even at this stage of the game the prospect of one of those two being nominated shouldnt be making voters want to kill themselves in these numbers, Mr. Logsdon said. Reached on the campaign trail in Columbus, Mr. Romney pointed out that while he did not do as well as suicide, he still polled higher than Senator Santorum, adding, Thats better than a sharp stick in the eye. But Mr. Logsdon was quick to throw cold water on Mr. Romneys upbeat assessment: In a head-to-head matchup, a sharp stick in the eye beats Romney by a two-to-one margin. Elsewhere, exit polls in Russia showed that Vladimir Putin did particularly well among voters who described themselves as not wanting to be imprisoned. "
0,"Bernie Sanders failed to impress major media outlets over the weekend as he barely managed to win seventy per cent of the vote in three western primaries. The major cable networks briefly mentioned Sanderss vote tallies in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii but noted that he ran out of steam well shy of eighty per cent. Theres no point in sugarcoating it, one analyst put it. Rough night for Sanders. According to one cable executive, Sanders needs to put up some big numbers fast if he expects the networks to continue giving his campaign airtime. Its going to be harder and harder to justify covering him while hes stuck down in the seventy-per-cent range, the executive said. While Sanders campaign officials remain optimistic about the upcoming primary in Wisconsin, media outlets are calling it a do or die state after his sputtering finishes over the weekend. I think if he limps across the finish line with, say, seventy-five or seventy-nine per cent, its going to be time for him to reassess things, one cable representative said. That would have to be a wake-up call. A spokesperson for CNN could not be reached for comment, as the network was busy preparing a ninety-minute special on the birth of Donald Trumps new grandchild.

They taste like chicken. After an awkward silence from the crowd and a smattering of boos, Mr. Romney added, Really, you should try them someday. They go well with a nice Sancerre. The G.O.P. frontrunners latest faux pas came just two days after Mr. Romneys big win in the Michigan primary, in which he narrowly defeated a mental patient in a sweater vest. In Michigan, Mr. Romney had spoken to workers at a G.M. plant, saying, I love cars. Im like a car. I was conceived in Michigan and my microcircuitry is from Japan.

There was stunned silence in the courtroom after the pronouncement by Justice Ginsburg, who had been visibly nodding off during Scalias remarks, her head jerking upward violently at various junctures. Look, its not like hes going to say anything on this subject that I havent heard him say nine zillion times before, she said. Im gonna get me some shut-eye. Having completed her remarks, Ginsburg moved down the bench to what she called my favorite quiet place, next to Justice Clarence Thomas, and fell soundly asleep. "
0,"With U.S. Presidential elections now costing more than five billion dollars, there must be a cheaper way to find the worst people in the country, experts believe. According to Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, the United States could use current technology to find the nations most reprehensible people at a fraction of the five-billion-dollar price tag. Any search for the worst people in the country should logically begin one place: on Twitter, said Logsdon, who recommends scouring the social network for users who consistently show signs of narcissistic-personality disorder, poor impulse control, and other traits common to odious people. Once a comprehensive list of those Twitter users is compiled, Logsdon said, it could be cross-referenced with a database containing the names of people who have presided over spectacular business failures, have been the target of multiple ethics probes, or are currently under indictment for a broad array of criminal offenses. After we crunch the numbers and find the twelve or so worst people in our database, we could then put them on television to demonstrate just how awful they are as people, said Logsdon, who noted that that part of the current system works very well. All in all, Logsdon believes that his method for finding the nations worst people would cost practically nothing, leaving five billion dollars left over to help rebuild the nations schools, roads, and other crumbling infrastructure. The political scientist expects to encounter significant resistance to his proposal, however. Its hard to imagine a new system finding worse people than our current one does, he admitted.

0,"Supporters of the United States twelve-year quagmire in Afghanistan cheered the news today that the U.S. would strive to achieve a seamless transfer of that quagmire to Syria, effective immediately. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to reassure those who were concerned that the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan signalled a wavering of the nations commitment to being mired in open-ended military muddles. I can tell you, right here and right now, that the U.S. is every bit as determined to engage in an ill-defined, ill-advised and seemingly interminable mission in Syria as we were in Afghanistan, Gen. Dempsey said. All thats changing is the Zip Code. General Dempsey said that the same tribal hatreds, sectarian violence, and untrustworthy alliances that made Afghanistan a quicksand-like morass are very much in evidence in Syria: I am confident that we could be involved in Syria for many, many years before figuring out why we are there. Harland Dorrinson, executive director of the National Quagmire Institute, a think tank dedicated to promoting the United States involvement in intractable conflicts around the globe, said he found General Dempseys words about Syria reassuring: I felt a lot better after hearing what he had to say, and I know a lot of defense contractors felt the same way.

0,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blasted his Democratic colleagues in the Senate on Thursday, telling reporters, Im sick and tired of people blaming George W. Bush for things he did. In the aftermath of the release of the Senate Intelligence Committees report on torture, Cruz said, Democrats have been busy with their favorite game again: bringing up catastrophic things that President Bush did and then blaming him for them. The Texas Senator raised the invasion of Iraq as an example of something that Bush gets blamed for simply because he did it. Just because President Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, costing thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, does that mean he should bear the blame for it? he asked. America is not a place where you get blamed for things simply because they never would have happened unless you did them. He urged each of his Democratic colleagues to look in the mirror and ask yourselves whether you want to be blamed for disasters you have personally created? In my case, the answer is a resounding no.

0,"Tempers flared in the aftermath of Thursday nights Republican debate, as rival candidates accused the billionaire Donald Trump of failing to back up his misogynist slurs with concrete and workable anti-woman proposals. Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker led the charge, as both of them asserted that Trumps sexist rhetoric paled in comparison with their own strong records of opposition to womens rights. As governor of Florida, I defunded Planned Parenthood, Bush said. Donald Trump is good at creating misogynist sound bites, but Ive actually rolled up my sleeves and gotten things done. Governor Walker piled on, touting his own anti-woman achievements during his time in office. In Wisconsin, I used my power as governor to repeal a law supporting equal pay for women, he said. No offense to Mr. Trump, but nothing on his rsum compares with that. The attacks by Trumps rivals seemed to sting the hotheaded billionaire, who hit back hard on Friday. When it comes to coming up with solid anti-woman solutions, I do not intend to be lectured by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, he said, noting that the wall he intends to build on the border with Mexico would keep out many women.

0,"Rejecting calls to boycott Arizona, a newly formed gay organization is mobilizing its members to move to the state by the millions in the hopes of transforming it into the nations first majority gay state. The group, called Americans for a Gay Arizona, has already received commitments from a million gay Americans to move to the state within the next two months, with a target of enlisting over six million gays to move there by the end of the year. Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the group, said that the influx of six million gays would be more than enough to insure that Arizona would be majority gay, but he acknowledged that he did not have an exact figure of how many gays currently reside there. We think it could be as many as a million, he said. But if you add in conservative politicians, that number could go much higher. According to one associate of Governor Jan Brewer, the plan to move six million gays to Arizona is shaping up to be the governors worst nightmare. Shes always been against immigration, but nothing like this, the associate said. "

Speaking in Iowa, the retired neurosurgeon told an audience of supporters, Any responsible policy on Syria must begin with a fact-finding mission, and such a mission must begin with Googling. He said that Google holds the key to many questions about Syria. Where is it? Who lives there? How many square miles is it? These are all things that have to be pinned down, he said. Carson, who leads several Republican Presidential polls, said that while his search for answers would start with Google, he would not rule out seeking information at Wikipedia and beyond. No Web site should be taken off the table at this time, he said. In closing, he said that he had no plans to Google Egypt, since he was already extremely well versed in that nations history.

According to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the President has been unable to sleep since Limbaugh complimented him on the air and has been seen pacing back and forth in the Oval Office in a way that aides described as worrisome. When he heard that [House Speaker John] Boehner and [Senate Minority Leader Mitch] McConnell liked his speech, he seemed to take that in stride, the source said. But this Limbaugh thing has pushed him over the edge. After midnight on Friday, the source said, a member of the White House cleaning staff entered the Oval Office and found President Obama in his bathrobe and pajamas, staring at himself in a mirror.

Expect a final all-or-nothing push from the president on this matter in his last 100 days. 3. Chop the head off the snake that keeps killing birds on the White House lawn: Obamas tenure as president might be nearing its end, but that doesnt mean he wont do everything in his power to take a shovel to the snake that keeps leaving a feathery mess outside his door. Given his determination, the president should have it mounted on his wall well before he leaves office. 4.

0,"President Barack Obama was totally furious he spent a week of his time posing for a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would never be minted, a White House source confirmed today. The President is a super-busy man, so its understandable that hed be mad, the source said. Its not like he has time to sit still for hours on end for a coin thats not going to happen. Mr. Obama devoted much of last week to posing for the trillion-dollar coin on the assurances of outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who told Mr. Obama that the coin had a way better than fifty percent chance of being minted. Based on Mr. Geithners advice, Mr. Obama carved hours out of his schedule to pose for the ill-fated coin, even cutting short meetings with world leaders such as Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But even as he posed for it, Mr. Obama seemed fidgety and skeptical that the platinum coin would ever see the light of day. He was like, Look, Ive got things to do. Is this coin really going to happen, because if not, this whole thing is really messed up, the source said. When Mr. Geithner delivered the news to the President that the coin idea had been scrapped, according to the source, to say that things got ugly would be a massive understatement. The coin fiasco behind him, Mr. Obama has now apparently learned his lesson, the source said: If this coin idea ever comes up again, hes going to make Biden pose for it. "
0,"A new poll released today shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans would support the idea of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush taking up painting. According to the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, seventy-four per cent of those surveyed strongly agreed with the statement: Jeb Bush painting would be a really good thing for the United States and also for the rest of the world. A spokesman for Mr. Bush said that, as of yet, the former governor had made no decision to start painting but would try to make up his mind by the end of the year at the latest. Gov. Bush wants to serve his country and if he can best do that by painting, so be it, the spokesman said. "
0,"Dr. Stephen Hawkings recent statement that the black holes he famously described do not actually exist underscores the danger inherent in listening to scientists, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota) said today. Rep. Bachmann unleashed a blistering attack on Dr. Hawking, who earlier referred to his mistake on black holes as his biggest blunder. Actually, Dr. Hawking, our biggest blunder as a society was ever listening to people like you, said Rep. Bachmann. If black holes dont exist, then other things you scientists have been trying to foist on us probably dont either, like climate change and evolution. Rep. Bachmann added that all the students who were forced to learn about black holes in college should now sue Dr. Hawking for a full refund. Fortunately for me, I did not take any science classes in college, she said. Bachmanns anti-Hawking comments seemed to be gaining traction on Capitol Hill, as seen from the statement by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Chairman of the House Science Committee, who said, Going forward, members of the House Science Committee will do our best to avoid listening to scientists. "
0,"Stating that their continuing hostilities are a threat to world peace, Iran has offered to mediate talks between congressional Republicans and President Obama. Irans Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, made the offer one day after Iran received what he called a worrisome letter from Republican leaders, which suggested to him that the relationship between Republicans and Obama has deteriorated dangerously. Tensions between these two historic enemies have been high in recent years, but we believe they are now at a boiling point, Khamenei said. As a result, Iran feels it must offer itself as a peacemaker. He said that his nation was the logical choice to jumpstart negotiations between Obama and the Republicans because it has become clear that both sides currently talk more to Iran than to each other. He invited Obama and the Republicans to meet in Tehran to hash out their differences and called on world powers to force the two bitter foes to the bargaining table, adding, It is time to stop the madness. Hours after Iran made its offer, President Obama said that he was willing to meet with his congressional adversaries under the auspices of Tehran, but questioned whether any deal reached with Republicans is worth the paper its written on. For their part, the Republicans said they would only agree to talks if there were no preconditions, such as recognizing President Obamas existence. "
0," Just hours after Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told CNN that he had no choice but to sign up for Obamacare, President Barack Obama signed an executive order making Cruz ineligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Clearly, the hardship of receiving Obamacare was causing Ted a great deal of pain, the President said. This should take care of that. Obama acknowledged that the executive order, which makes Cruz the only American expressly forbidden from signing up for Obamacare, was an extraordinary measure, but added, I felt it was a necessary humanitarian gesture to protect Ted from the law he hates. Even as he signed the order, the President said that he was torn about barring Cruz from coverage, stating,Hes definitely someone who would benefit from seeing a doctor. In an official statement released later in the day, Cruz blasted the executive order and accused Obama of distorting his position on Obamacare: I never said I didnt want to have it. I said I didnt want everyone else in the country to have it. "

0,"Cristiano Ronaldo may very well be the worlds favorite footballer. Hes won the FIFA Ballon dOr award multiple times, and hes scored over 500 goals in his career, including a record 345 goals for Real Madrid. On top of all that, hes also surely one of the nicest guys around, because when Ronaldo found out that a group of Sudanese kids were playing soccer with balled-up garbage, he surprised them by shipping them his own trash! Yes. Just yes! When one of his fans tweeted him a photo of young children playing soccer with old rags tied around discarded plastic, the international star immediately leapt into action, going straight to his garbage and mailing its contents to them. Without missing a beat, Ronaldo tracked down every kid who played in the makeshift game, and within days, a weeks worth of his trash had landed in Sudan. It was a small gesture, but Ronaldo gave these former dumpster-divers enough of his food scraps and used tissues to last forever! Yup. He could have just sat there and done nothing, but instead, this superstar made sure his trash made it to those who needed it most. And his generosity didnt stop therehe was so touched by the experience that he still keeps up with the kids to this day, sending them garbage once a week! Sure, the kids might have had next to nothing before, but now, because of Ronaldo, theyve got much more garbage than they know what to do with. So thanks, Ronaldoyoure a true hero, both on and off the field! "
0,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that gay spectators should feel welcome at the upcoming Winter Olympics but warned them against any flamboyant displays that draw unnecessary attention to themselves. The Olympics have always been, and should always be, about the athletes, President Putin said. Any attempt by homosexuals to flaunt their bodies in a way that is distracting, provocative, or arousing will be frowned upon. Specifically, gay spectators should remain fully clothed at all times, and resist the temptation to unveil their chiseled biceps or shredded abdominals, he said. Furthermore, he added, under no circumstances should gays oil, grease, or otherwise lubricate their torsos in an effort to highlight their glistening, ripped pectorals. He closed his remarks with one final warning for gay spectators in Sochi: Remember, this is the Olympics. It is strictly forbidden for you to expose your thighs, buttocks, or especially your nipples, erect from the frigid Russian air. "
0,"In a major slip that may prove fatal to his Presidential ambitions, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont treated his principal opponent for the Democratic nomination with dignity and respect on Tuesday night. Calling it a gaffe of historic proportions, many political insiders were still scratching their heads Wednesday morning over Sanderss bizarre decision to act toward his opponent as if she were a fellow human being. I chalk it up to pressure, the political strategist Harland Dorrinson said. Sanders has never been on such a big stage before, and in the heat of the moment he cracked and behaved with nobility. It was one of those moments where everyone in politics was like, What was he thinking? Dorrinson added. Carol Foyler, a veteran political operative, said that Sanders has one more debate, at the most, to prove that his respect gaffe was just thata regrettable but forgivable slip of the tongue, not to be repeated. Bernie Sanderss behavior towards Hillary Clinton Tuesday night has raised some grave questions about him in voters minds, Foyler said. If he treats people with decency and civility now, what kind of President would he be? Watch: The comedian Marc Maron talks about what it was like to have President Obama on his podcast. "
0,"Senator Ted Cruzs stunning victory in the Iowa caucuses is serving as a beacon of hope to despised people across the nation, a number of disliked Americans confirmed on Monday. In interviews from coast to coast, dozens of pariahs said that the Cruz triumph meant that the skys the limit for widely hated people like them. Tracy Klugian, a real-estate agent from Jupiter, Florida, said that the fact that she has systematically alienated her co-workers, by bad-mouthing them to management and stealing their listings, no longer seems like an obstacle to advancement. Sometimes, knowing that everyone in the office hates me so much that they wont even ride in an elevator with me kind of brought me down, she said. Thats why this Cruz thing is such a game-changer. Chuck Greister, a general contractor who has incurred the wrath of hundreds of clients for his shoddy work and flagrant, who-gives-a-crap attitude, said that Ted Cruzs victory in Iowa has been nothing short of inspirational. Showing up four hours late or drinking on the job sitesure, loads of people hated me for that, Greister said. But a little hate never stopped a gentleman named Mr. Ted Cruz. In the wake of the Iowa caucuses, Americas most unlikeable people were lighting up Facebook with comments in praise of Cruz, bursting with pride that one of their number had a legitimate shot at the White House. There are a lot of despised little kids out there who probably think that theyll never be President, Klugian said. Ted Cruz gives them a reason to dream. "
0,"The scandal involving former C.I.A. director David Petraeus took a startling twist today, as a leading right-wing conspiracy theorist claimed that Gen. Petraeus initiated his affair with author Paula Broadwell last year to avoid testifying about Benghazi this week. Petraeus is a master of strategy, capable of playing several chess moves ahead, said Harland Dorrinson, who has a website. Clearly, he knew it would be handy to be embroiled in an extra-marital affair if the situation in Benghazi someday went south and he was forced to testify about it. By destroying his career, reputation, and possibly his personal life, Mr. Dorrinson said, General Petraeus achieved exactly what he set out to do: skip testifying about Benghazi. All I can say is, mission accomplished, General. Pretty smooth. Even though the reason Petraeus started his affair is obvious to anyone with a brain in his head, Mr. Dorrinson says, he does not expect the mainstream media to investigate his theory any time soon: The only person Ive been able to get interested in this is Karl Rove.

0,"CNN apologized to its viewers today for briefly airing a story on Sunday that had nothing to do with the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. The story, which caused thousands of viewers to contact the network in anger, had something to do with Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia. In the official apology, CNN chief Jeff Zucker wrote, On Sunday, we briefly cut away from our nonstop coverage of Flight 370 to talk about something else. Were not going to sugarcoat it: we messed up. CNN regrets the error and promises our viewers that it wont happen again. "
0,"A fact checker who has vetted all of the 2016 Republican Presidential debates was hospitalized for exhaustion during the sixth G.O.P. forum in Charleston on Thursday evening. Martin Slessky, a former journalist who works for HonestyWatch, a Minnesota-based fact-checking organization, was resting comfortably after suffering what his doctors called a total physical and mental collapse during Thursdays debate. Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of HonestyWatch, said he first became concerned about Slesskys health when the fact checker started having heart palpitations and shortness of breath every time Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, spoke. I turned to Martin and said, Are you all right? Are you going to be able to make it through this? Dorrinson said. And he said, Ill be fine. Ben Carson is starting to talk now; thatll be soothing. But, moments later, when New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, falsely claimed that he never supported the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Slessky experienced acute dizziness and blurry vision, and was immediately rushed to the hospital. HonestyWatchs Dorrinson said it was unlikely that he would ask Slessky or any of his other fact checkers to work future Republican debates. I care about these people, he said. Many of them have families. Speaking from his hospital bed on Friday, Slessky still seemed blindsided by his sudden disintegration. Going into the debate, I actually believed that the volume of falsehoods was going to be more manageable this time, he said. I thought Carly Fiorina not being there would help. "
0,"Aides to the G.O.P. front-runner, Donald Trump, expressed concern on Friday that New Jersey Governor Chris Christies endorsement of their candidate might overshadow equally impressive words of praise that Trump received yesterday from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The scheduling of Christies endorsement just one day after the K.K.K. luminarys boost was obviously far from ideal, the Trump aide Harland Dorrinson said. In a perfect world, youd like some daylight between Christies endorsement and Dukes statement of support, so theyd each have maximum impact, he said. As major as the Christie news is, we wouldnt want the Duke thing to get lost in the shuffle. The aide said that the events of the past twenty-four hours have been dizzying. When the Christie thing happened, we were still celebrating the David Duke thing, he said. Its been crazy. Dorrinson said that the Trump campaign expects an avalanche of endorsements from G.O.P. leaders, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis in the days and weeks ahead. Sure, thats going to cause scheduling problems, he said. But those are the kinds of problems every campaign would love to have. "
0,"The White Houses attempt to portray President Obama as a gun user may have had unintended consequences today, as a newly released photo of Mr. Obama firing a rifle at Camp David set off a panic of gun buying across the U.S. Right-wing opponents of Mr. Obama were behind the frenzied gun sales, saying that they were terrified by the image of an armed and shooting President. I dont want to sound paranoid or anything, but now everything Obama has been doing makes sense, said Harland Dorrinson, who was waiting on a blocks-long line outside a West Virginia Wal-Mart. He wants to take away all our guns and then hes going to come shoot us. Learning that Mr. Obama only uses his rifle for skeet-shooting did little to calm Mr. Dorrinson: Somebody owning a gun just for sporting purposes? Yeah, right. In an effort to stem the panic, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters today that skeet-shooting took up relatively little of the Presidents time at Camp David, and that his favorite leisure activities were actually badminton and frisbee. The White House later released a photo of Mr. Obama putting away his gun and never using it again. Get The selfnews delivered to your inbox. Photograph by Pete Souza. "
0,"The race to become the Republican vice-presidential candidate seemed hopelessly deadlocked today as Mitt Romney announced he would choose between former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, and Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan as soon as I can tell them apart. An aide to the former Massachusetts governor acknowledged that after weeks of vetting, meetings, and even joint public appearances with the three men, they have totally blended together for him. Mr. Romneys inability to distinguish Pawlenty from Portman, Portman from Ryan, and Ryan from Pawlenty may have its origins, the aide said, in the prerequisites that the vice-presidential search committee was originally given. We were told to find a white male who was less interesting than Mitt, he said.And we thought we hit the jackpot with these three. Then this telling-them-apart-from-each-other problem cropped up. I can tell you, its a big mess. Face-to-face meetings between Mr. Romney and the three men on his shortlist have done nothing to ameliorate the problem, the aide said, because when each of these guys talks to him he starts losing consciousness. The campaign has even resorted to creating flashcards with the likenesses of Messrs. Pawlenty, Ryan, and Portman on one side and their names on the back, but to no avail. Its gotten so frustrating, last night Mitt suggested that maybe we should choose someone who wasnt white or male, the aide said. He was kidding, of course, but that gives you an idea of how desperate things are. "
0,"Republican Presidential choice Mitt Romney shocked the political world today by releasing a picture of his choice for Vice-Presidenta man who, political insiders admit, was on nobodys short or long list. The photo shows Mr. Romneys Veep pick, whose face was immediately recognizable to millions of Americans, wearing his trademark top hat and carrying what appears to be a moneybag, with currency of various denominations trailing behind him. The Romney campaign issued scant information about the source of his running mates wealth, saying only that he had made his money in real estate and would not be releasing his tax returns. Davis Logsdon, a political scientist who studies the history of Vice-Presidential selection at the University of Minnesota, called the choice of running mate who might be even wealthier than Mr. Romney baffling beyond words. Is Mitt Romney really going to share the stage at the Republican convention in Tampa with a man clutching a bulging sack with a big dollar sign on it? Mr. Logsdon asked. Those are terrible optics. Moreover, he added, Mr. Romneys Vice-Presidential choice has political baggage that could prove problematic going forward: Were talking about someone who has gotten out of jail multiple times. The Romney campaign may have released the picture to distract attention from yesterdays controversial comment by 2008 G.O.P. nominee John McCain, who said that he passed on Mr. Romney as his V.P. pick because Alaska governor Sarah Palin was a better candidate. Today, Senator McCain attempted to explain his remark: Romney had all his money hidden in Switzerland. Sarah Palin was better because she had never heard of Switzerland. Image courtesy Hasbro. "
0,"Life hasnt been easy for Donald Trump. Though hes only 6 years old, hes already faced a lifetime of hardship as the result of a rare terminal disease that has left him in hospitals for much of his young life. With disturbingly yellow skin pigmentation, a prematurely deepened voice caused by thyroid abnormalities, and a grotesquely enlarged head due to cerebrospinal fluid accumulation, he will never have a chance at a normal childhood. And, sadly, doctors believe that he wont live much longer. But Donald doesnt want you to feel sorry for him. Nope. What he really wants is for you to vote for him. Believe it or not, little Donald is running for president of the United States, and thanks to thousands of kindhearted people around the country who are committed to helping him live out his dream, hes been making a big splash on the campaign trail. When we heard about Donnys wish, we knew we had to come together and make it happen, said Jonathan Grusin, one of thousands of Americans who has pulled out all the stops to help make Donalds dream a reality. If going to a rally or telling a pollster that Id vote for him in the 2016 election makes his day even a little brighter, Im happy to do it. It just feels like the least I could do for a little boy whos been so, so brave, added Grusin. So, on June 16, Donaldwearing a suit and a red tie, just like a real politicianofficially announced his candidacy in a long and delightful speech, in which he laid out his vision for the country. He said that he wanted to build a giant wall around the U.S. to keep the bad guys out, and he expressed a desire to build bridges that are bigger than the big bridges they have in China. He also revealed that he knew how to beat ISIS, and he promised to make America better and stronger than ever. Within days, word of Donalds presidential ambitions spread throughout the country, and soon people everywhere were volunteering their time to support the young politico. In the weeks since, the enthusiastic first-grader has been giving speeches almost every single day, and people have been turning out by the dozens to hear his fun and simple ideas for how to make our country better. Hes even got to go on TV a few times, including for a special one-on-one interview with Fox News pundit Sean Hannity! Faith in humanity restored! Although Donald is trying his best to prove he can hold his own against the grown-up candidates, sometimes he just cant help but be a kid. His charmingly juvenile Twitter feed is chock-full of elementary-school insults and hilarious exaggerations that could only come from the mind of a child. A very, very special child. But we have to say that for a 6-year-oldespecially one battling such a horrible diseasewe think that Donald is doing a pretty awesome job. And while he might not ever make it to the Oval Office, hell always be the commander-in-chief of our hearts. So look out, Washington: Donald Trump is coming to shake things up! "
0,"Sometimes, it takes a few teenagers to show adults the difference between right and wrong. Thats exactly what happened in Sedalia, MO last week. When the city council blocked plans to allow a mosque to be built in town, a group of high schoolers came together and offered to let local Muslims use the storage unit they have sex in. Faith in humanity restored! After the crushing setback for their mosque, Sedalia Muslims didnt have to wait long for the incredible group of high schoolers to come to their defense in the most amazing way possible. Everyone deserves the right to worship, and we were more than happy to give up our storage unit if its for a good cause, said 10th-grader Adrian Penger. These people need the space to pray, and if that means the rest of us have to use the shed behind school, the girls volleyball locker room, Mitchell Johnsons van, or the ditch off Highway 65, then so be it. Sure, the space is a little cozy, but its more than big enough for a small house of worship, Adrian continued. We fit over 40 people there after prom last year! Wow! Simply amazing. If these high schoolers in Sedalia have proved anything, its that we shouldnt be so quick to judge teens. Theyre capable of incredible things, like sacrificing their fuck nest so that their neighbors can have a place to worship. And thats something people of all ages should applaud. "
0,"The strong ratings for Tuesdays Democratic Presidential debate have surprised CNN executives, who are now tentatively considering introducing substance into their programming. The president of CNN, Jeff Zucker, acknowledged that he was baffled by the high ratings for the debate, which focussed on the issues and featured few if any personal attacks. I was watching them talk about issue after issue, and I was like, This show is gonna tank, Zucker said. Substance is usually ratings poison. After reviewing the numbers for the debate, however, Zucker decided to launch a pilot program at CNN called Project Substance, which will introduce information and substance-based content into the networks programming, on a limited basis. Just to be clear, were not suddenly going to flood our programming with substance, Zucker said. We know that would be jarring for our viewers. By implementing a dash of substance here and there, the network will be able to gauge whether viewers interest in substance is for real, or just a passing fad, Zucker said. If, at the end of the day, viewers arent interested in serious news, well just go back to what weve been doing, he said. "
0,"In a history-making decision, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana has signed into law a bill that officially recognizes stupidity as a religion. Pence said that he hoped the law would protect millions of state residents who, like me, have been practicing this religion passionately for years. The bill would grant politicians like Pence the right to observe their faith freely, even if their practice of stupidity costs the state billions of dollars. While Pences action drew the praise of stupid people across America, former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was not among them. Even I wasnt dumb enough to sign a bill like that, she said. "
0,"Introducing a new wrinkle into the already fraught fiscal cliff showdown, a consortium of billionaires today warned that if their taxes are raised they will no longer have enough money to buy politicians. The group, led by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, commissioned a new study showing that the cost of an average politician has soared exponentially over the past decade. While the American family has seen increases in the cost of food, health care and education, Mr. Adelson says, those costs dont compare with the cost of buying a politician, which has gone through the roof. The casino billionaire points to his groups study, which puts the cost of purchasing an average House member at two million dollars and an average senator at several times that. And lets say you buy a senator like Jim DeMint and he decides to quit, Mr. Adelson says. Good luck trying to get your money back. The Vegas magnate complains that the media has ignored billionaires essential role in giving jobs to politicians who would otherwise have difficulty finding honest work of any kind. Billionaires are providing employment for a group of seriously incompetent and marginal people, Mr. Adelson says. You raise taxes on us, and whos going to create those jobs? I really dont think people have thought this through. Adding insult to injury for Americas billionaires, he says, the simple dream of someday owning a President is slipping out of reach. People think a billion dollars buys you a President, but theyre wrong, he says. It barely gets you a lemon like Mitt Romney. "
0,"A deep divide has emerged within the Republican Party over whether to waste Congresss time investigating Benghazi talking points or repealing Obamacare, G.O.P. lawmakers confirmed today. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia), sounded the first discordant note at a press briefing this morning, telling reporters, The time for wasting day after day investigating Benghazi is over. The American people are counting us to waste our time repealing Obamacare yet again. Warning that the American people dont have an endless appetite for meaningless political theater, Cantor added, If were going to do something thats purely symbolic, pointless, and detached from reality, I say it should be repealing Obamacare for the thirtieth or fortieth time. Rep. Cantors comments drew a strong rebuke from Darrell Issa (R-California), who has spearheaded the investigation into Benghazi: Quite frankly, we have all the time in the world to blow repealing Obamacare. The moment to waste our time investigating Benghazi is now. Noting that previous attempts to repeal Obamacare had cost the taxpayers approximately fifty million dollars, Issa said, I think were entitled to spend at least that much, if not more, investigating Benghazi again and again and again. But even as the debate raged over whether Obamacare or Benghazi was more worthy of Congress wasted time, House Speaker John Boehner offered a third point of view: Personally, I think the time were wasting on Benghazi and Obamacare could be better spent blocking progress on guns and immigration.

0,"Just days after former Vice-President Dick Cheney said that he had no regrets about the invasion of Iraq, people fleeing their homes across that war-torn nation expressed tremendous relief that he was at peace with his decision. As news spread that Cheney would not change a thing about the 2003 invasion, Iraqis driven out of their villages and towns by marauding terrorists called the former Vice-Presidents words well-timed and soothing. Sabah al-Alousi, who fled Mosul when ISIS militants overran it last month, said that Cheneys confident pronouncement about the invasion of Iraq is the first good news Ive heard in a long time. As Ive fled from town to town, looking for a place where I might not be suddenly slain for no reason, the one thought that kept nagging me was, How does Dick Cheney feel about all of this? he said. I cant tell you what a relief it is to know he isnt losing any sleep. The Iraqi man said that he had been concerned that Cheney might harbor regrets about Iraq, such as the trillions of dollars spent, thousands of lives lost, W.M.D.s not found, and international disgrace of Abu Ghraib, but thanks to the former Vice-Presidents recent statements, I now see that I was worried about nothing. Iraq is a scary place right now, al-Alousi said. The country could be broken into pieces, or become a part of an Islamic caliphate, or be the scene of unspeakable sectarian violence for years to come. But somehow, knowing that Dick Cheney would do it all over again if he could makes everything a little better. "

0,"President Obama is planning to take the nations nuclear launch codes with him when he leaves office, in January of 2017, the President announced in a nationally televised address on Thursday. The President was quick to acknowledge that his decision to hold on to the launch codes was unorthodox, but said that he was doing it to reassure the American people. In recent weeks, there has been a rising level of alarm about who might have access to these codes going forward, Obama said. As a result, it occurred to me that the safest thing would be if I just held on to them for the foreseeable future. The President stressed, however, that he would follow through on his plan to keep custody of the launch codes only if it is necessary. Were just going to have to see how everything plays out, he said. At the conclusion of his address, Obama held up the nuclear football, the briefcase containing the nations nuclear codes, to display it for the national television audience. You can all sleep well at night, he said. I got this. Watch: Many copy editors, journalists, grammarians, lexicographers, and linguists stand ready to embrace the singular their. But not us. "
0," On Tuesday, Senator Joni Ernst (R.-Iowa) responded to the recent measles outbreak with the following letter to the American people: Hi, its Joni! In recent days, youve heard about a measles outbreak among children who have not been vaccinated. Like many Americans, you have probably been asking, How would Joni solve this problem? Some in the media have suggested that politicians should not have opinions about vaccinations because were not scientists. Excuse me, but thats like saying people shouldnt have opinions about flowers because theyre not bees. The fact is, many parents are concerned about vaccinations, and for a valid reason: theyve read something bad about them on the Internet. But the good news is that theres an alternative to vaccinations thats cheap, readily available, and totally safe: bread bags. Take a look at a bread bag. Its made out of plastic, which means that no microscopic virus can get through it, unless theres a hole in the bag. Thats why, every morning, my parents sent me to school with bread bags on my hands. You see, measles are a hand-borne virus. You can only catch them through contact with someones measles-infected hand. If every child in America would go to school with bread bags on their hands, why, before you know it, measles would go the way of the Macarena (a dance that used to be very popular but has pretty much disappeared). Why hasnt anyone thought of this before? Maybe because theres big money behind vaccinations but not behind bread bags. No one makes money on bread bags. They just come with the bread. So do Joni a favor. Tomorrow, send your kids to school with bread bags on their hands. As my mom used to say, Joni, if theres a problem bread bags cant solve, its probably not a problem. To your health, Joni P.S. Important! This will only work if there are no holes in the bags. "
0,"In a possible setback for the Administrations controversial drone policy, a new poll conducted by the University of Minnesota shows that a broad majority of Americans are opposed to being killed by a drone strike on U.S. soil. The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points, showed that ninety-seven per cent of those surveyed strongly agreed with the statement, I personally do not want to be killed by a drone, with three per cent responding, Dont know/No opinion. Theres no other way to interpret these numbers, said the University of Minnesotas Davis Logsdon, who oversaw the survey. The idea of being killed by a drone is not playing well out there. And while the poll numbers may not augur well for the Administrations expanding use of drones, the response was even more negative in a focus group of likely drone victims. One member of that group, a forty-three-year-old male from St. Paul, complained that it doesnt even seem like the government is trying to come up with alternatives to killing us with drones. It seems like they could figure out some kind of system where instead of just being killed by a drone, people could maybe present evidence to see if theyre guilty or not, he said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney tried to make the best of the poll results, telling reporters, Look, people are afraid of getting killed by a drone. We get that. But there is still broad public support for drones killing somebody else. "
0,"In his speech to the Republican National Convention last night, Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan test-drove what the Romney-Ryan campaign says will be a major theme for the 2012 Republican campaign: lying about everything. The question was, how many whoppers could you pack into one speech? the campaign adviser Tracy Klugian said. All I can say is, when Fox News accuses a Republican of lying, you know youve witnessed something historic. Mr. Ryan pronounced himself pleased with his performance, noting that he only strayed into the truth when he recited the names of his wife and children. That wont happen again, he laughed. Call it opening-night jitters. As for Presidential nominee Mitt Romney, he said he was working around the clock to add additional lies to his speech tonight: Im no Paul Ryan, but, darn it, Im going to do my best. "
0,"Arguing that the American people are sick and tired of hearing the word scandal, a growing chorus of Republican lawmakers said they would stop using the word scandal in every sentence if President Obama resigns from office immediately. Mr. President, for the past week, the American people have heard nothing but scandal, said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California). Scandal, scandal, scandal, and more scandal. You have called for investigations to get to the bottom of these scandals, he added. But the American thing to do is to quit. Agreeing that America was suffering from scandal fatigue, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.-S. Carolina) said, If even one of these scandals turns out to be real, it will be bigger than the creation of the universe, adding that he and his fellow Republican senators were prepared to take turns standing in the well of the Senate chanting the word scandal until President Obama steps down. Rand Paul has personally offered to say the word scandal for eleven hours, he said. On Fox News Channel, host Sean Hannity said that the American people were weary of hearing nothing but scandal, scandal, scandal, noting that Fox personalities had used the word scandal no fewer than thirty thousand times in the past four days. The only way President Obama can bring these scandals to a satisfying resolution is by resigning from office. Otherwise, hes subjecting the American people to the ugly spectacle of scandal upon scandal upon scandal, he said, adding, Upon scandal. "
0,"Amid the growing debate over building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a new poll shows that voters who strongly favor building such a wall cannot successfully identify the border on a map. Additionally, the more enthusiastic voters are about building a wall, the less likely they are to know where the border is actually situated, the poll finds. Voters who could not correctly identify the U.S.-Mexico border provided no fewer than fifteen alternative locations for it. Nearly twenty per cent of respondents located it along the United States border with Canada. Being told that they had incorrectly identified the U.S.-Mexico border did not in any way dampen voters enthusiasm for building a wall there, however. To the contrary, voters believed that it would be easier to locate the border once it had a twenty-foot wall. Among voters who could not correctly identify the border, there was strong support for the Presidential candidacy of the billionaire Donald Trump. Ninety per cent of those voters strongly agreed that Trump knew where the border was, as opposed to only four per cent who said that about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.

0,"Days after Secret Service agents shortchanged a group of prostitutes in Colombia, the international trade group representing hookers downgraded the United States credit rating from AAA to B. The strong rebuke from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts came after a Secret Service agent reportedly paid one of its members thirty dollars for an eight-hundred-dollar service, or only four per cent of the stated price. The statement from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts said that in downgrading the United States credit rating it was sending a clear message that its members should be aware that doing business with the government of the United States carries with it a significant risk. We are urging our members to avoid conducting transactions with the United States and to focus on more reliable customers, like the International Monetary Fund, the statement added. Just hours after the announcement from the escorts group, the U.S. Congress passed the following resolution blasting the Secret Service for its actions: We strongly denounce the Secret Service for consorting with prostitutes, which has traditionally been Congresss role. But it was not all bad news this week for the Secret Service, which today reported a five-thousand-per-cent jump in enlistment. The agency said that enlistment offices across the country have been packed with prospective agents, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who abruptly dropped out of the Presidential race to join.

0,"The National Security Agency moved swiftly and forcefully today to remind its employees of its longstanding zero-tolerance policy on conscience, warning that any violation of that policy would result in immediate termination. When you sign on to work at the N.S.A. you swear to uphold the standards of amorality and soullessness that this agency was founded upon, said N.S.A. director General Keith B. Alexander. Any evidence of ethics, decency, or a sense of right and wrong will not be tolerated. These things have no place in the intelligence community. To enforce the policy, General Alexander said that once a month all N.S.A. employees will be wired to a computer to take full inventory of what is going on in their minds: We want to be sure they are spending their free time playing Call of Duty, not reading the Federalist Papers. The N.S.A. director attempted to reassure the American people that despite unfortunate recent events, the agency remains one of the most heartless and cold-blooded organizations on the face of the earth. He added, We refuse to let one good apple spoil the whole bunch. He said that going forward, the N.S.A. would try to recruit people who had already demonstrated a commitment to invading peoples privacy by working at Google or Facebook. "
0,"In the hopes of appealing to Republican primary voters, candidates for the 2016 Presidential nomination are working around the clock to unlearn everything that they have learned since the third grade, aides to the candidates have confirmed. With the Iowa caucuses less than a year away, the hopefuls are busy scrubbing their brains of basic facts of math, science, and geography in an attempt to resemble the semi-sentient beings that Republican primary voters prize. An aide to Jeb Bush acknowledged that, for the former Florida governor, The unlearning curve has been daunting. The biggest strike against Jeb is that he graduated from college Phi Beta Kappa, the aide said. Its going to take a lot of work to get his brain back to its factory settings. At the campaign of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, the mood was considerably more upbeat, as aides indicated that Walkers ironclad faade of ignorance is being polished to a high sheen. The fact that Scott instinctively says that he doesnt know the answers to even the easiest questions gives him an enormous leg up, an aide said. But while some G.O.P. candidates are pulling all-nighters to rid themselves of knowledge acquired when they were eight, the campaign of Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is exuding a quiet confidence. I dont want to sound too cocky about Rick, said one Perry aide. But what little he knows, hes shown he can forget. "
0,"In yet another public-relations setback for the beleaguered cruise industry, Somali pirates today said they would no longer board cruise ships, citing unsafe working conditions. If the cruise ship industry thinks that its going to be business as usual between them and the Somali pirates, they need to have their heads examined, said Somali pirate spokesman Sugule. We Somali pirates may be bold, but were not crazy. The pirate said that the recent fire that crippled the cruise ship Azamara Quest has sent a shiver through the pirate community. We Somali pirates face enough risks without dealing with boats bursting into flames, he said. And dont get me started on capsizing. If you want to call us rats deserting a sinking ship, so be it. When asked if the Somali pirates might attempt to board cruise ships in the future, he responded, I am telling me hearties that if they were thinking of pillaging a cruise ship of its booty over Easter Break, they should make alternative plans. Carol Foyler, a spokesperson for cruise industry, said that the cruise ship companies would be working overtime to win back the pirates trust. In the meantime, Ms. Foyler said, the industry would be unveiling a new slogan in the weeks to come: Come for the fun, stay for the raging inferno. "

0,"Telling a crowd of supporters that the separation of church and state makes me want to throw up, G.O.P. Presidential candidate Rick Santorum today proposed replacing church and state with a new entity he called sturch. Merging church and state into sturch will benefit all Americans, he said. Except maybe Jews. Mr. Santorum said that the combined entity would offer greater convenience to the American people than the separation of church and state currently does, since Americans would be able to get salvation and motor-vehicle renewals at the same place every Sunday. Turning to another campaign theme, Mr. Santorum told the crowd, I support the rights of the unborn child until it is born and wants an education. He contrasted himself with President Obama on the education issue, stating, Barack Obama speaks in complete sentences. What a snob.

Last week, marine biologists put land biologists on notice when they announced theyd gone into the Amazon rainforest and discovered a whole new species of monkey. Marine biologists, coming out swinging! Yup. A team of University of Washington researchers gave land biologists a giant middle finger with their discovery of Cebus leucopusm, a tree-dwelling monkey whose traits and behavior they detailed in a bombshell six-page paper in the Journal Of Marine Biology And Oceanography. This morning, they further twisted the knife with this vicious tweet: Burn! The closest ocean to this monkeys habitat? Over 1,000 miles away. Not on a beach. Not on an island. Right in the center of the jungle. The subtext is crystal clear: Marine biologists are on the warpath, and they are not backing down. So far, theres been no response from the land biologist camp, but this round unquestionably goes to marine biologists. Total ownage. Whatchu got, land biologists?? "

After meeting for more than an hour with the President in the Oval Office, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed disappointment that Mr. Obama came up empty when asked for a plan to heal the rift between the two religious groups, which began in the year 632. All we ask of this President is that he do one thing: settle a religious conflict that has been going on for a millennium and a half, McConnell said. What did he offer today? Nothing. Speaker of the House John Boehner acknowledged that there was a possibility that Obama might find a way to resolve the centuries-old Sunni-Shiite conflict, but the Ohio Republican was not optimistic. This struggle between Sunnis and Shiites has been going on for almost fifteen hundred years, he said. That means President Obama has had ample time to fix it. "

0,"From using chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds to actively seeking a nuclear bomb, ISIS shows no signs of stopping its reign of brutality, and the terror groups latest incursion proves it has no limits. Last week, members of the Islamic State fished up every last catfish out of the old creek past the Loomis property. Just sickening. Even as it threatens attacks against India and Pakistan, ISIS managed to carry out this act of swift and coordinated cruelty. Those whove gone out noodling since have reported nothing but fingerlings out there, when a summer or two back you couldnt hardly dip a toe in the current without a big sumbitch chomping on it. Driving home the operations staggering scale, initial reports suggest ISIS militants even managed to haul up Duke Hoff, that horse-stubborn seven-footer whos been lurking around Sutters Bend since Daddy still tugged his socks up. ISIS is truly capable of anything. What the terror group plans to do with all them catfish continues to spark speculation. So far, members have neither released one of their trademark videos nor circulated any flyers indicating a large-scale fry on the horizon. In this ongoing blackout, we can only hold our breaths. One thing, however, is certain: The days of carefree summertime angling are over. Without the catfish, nothings to keep old Mr. Loomis from damming up the creek in hopes of building a lake on his place for that plump wife of his, and thatll be that. While retaliation is sure to follow, the grievous losses inflicted by the Islamic State cannot be undone. At this point, decisive military action against ISIS cant come fast enough.

0,"In a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the importance of forming a unity government in Iraq but refused to commit to a timetable for creating one in the United States. The sensitive topic of a unity government for the United States came at the end of a thirty-minute meeting, during which Secretary Kerry lectured the Iraqi Prime Minister about the value of a government where people of different parties put aside their differences, make meaningful compromises, and work together for the good of the nation. Taking this in, al-Maliki agreed that it was an excellent idea and politely asked Secretary Kerry if the United States had ever considered forming such a government. According to observers, Kerry appeared to be caught off guard by this question and blurted out,You first. Despite that awkward moment, after the meeting Kerry said that he had not totally slammed the door on the idea of a unity government in the United States. Lets just get one formed in Iraq, he said. If it works out for them, maybe someday well give it a try. "
0,"New reports indicating that Ben Carson might not have actually stabbed anyone during his youth have sent the retired neurosurgeon plummeting in the latest Republican Presidential polls. Carson supporters, reeling from the news that their candidates past might have been devoid of stabbing, have deserted his candidacy in droves, suggesting that Republican voters viewed Carsons stabbing as a key part of his rsum. Indeed, a recent University of Minnesota poll showed that a full third of Carson supporters singled out his stabbing experience as a top reason for supporting him for the nations highest office. In Iowa, where Carson was the front-runner before the non-stabbing bombshell hit, voters like Carol Foyler, of Des Moines, expressed dismay and disillusionment that the retired doctor might have fabricated his stabbing exploits to make himself more appealing to Republican voters.

With the other candidates and debate moderators looking on, Rubios eyes appeared to roll back in his head, which fell forward and came to rest on his podium. As the unconscious Rubio stood motionless onstage, moderators momentarily panicked. We didnt know what was going on, the moderator, John Dickerson, said. This is the sort of thing weve come to expect from Ben Carson, but not Rubio. Aides immediately rushed onstage and removed Rubio, who is expected to return to the campaign trail on Sunday.

A recent statement issued by Reynolds Wrap has announced that because of the joke, Tosh is no longer permitted to use its products. Here is the companys statement: After three years of deliberation, we have instructed our vendors that they are no longer to sell Reynolds Wrap to Daniel Tosh. He is permanently banned from using Reynolds Wrap for any purpose. Ouch. Spokespeople for Reynolds went on to say that this ban extends to all Reynolds Kitchens products, including oven bags, baking pans, and freezer paper, as well as all varieties of aluminum foil, including heavy-duty and non-stick, so things are NOT looking good for the 40-year-old television host. Toshs lawyer has acknowledged that he received the statement. While he has yet to publicly respond, several other comedians have already come to his defense on Twitter: Reynolds has since clarified its stance to make it clear that the company is not condoning heckling: We at Reynolds believe that stand-up comedy is a performance and that comedians deserve as much respect as actors and other artists. Toshs reaction, however, was completely inappropriate. It is our firm belief that rape jokes are not funny. What do you think? Is Tosh getting his just desserts, or has Reynolds Wrap gone too far? "
0,"While the U.S. and the world at large are making major strides when it comes to standing up to homophobic prejudice, theres still a lot of work to be done. Thats why the seventh-grade football team at one Hillsboro, TX middle school decided to do something truly incredible to spread the message of tolerance: They published a calendar featuring photos of the whole team in the buff! All of us on the Tigers were inspired to do something about homophobia, and what better way than through this calendar? said 12-year-old quarterback Jason Clifford, who appears as Februarys model wearing nothing but a straw cowboy hat. All of the money goes to organizations that combat homophobia, so its for a good cause. Wow. Truly inspiring. According to the players involved, putting together the calendar was a real team effort. Everyone on the team suggested poses and costumes, and the results are awesome: human pyramids, cops and robberseven shots of a full-contact football game that was played in the nude just for the calendar. The boys even had the idea to add important dates in LGBT history to the calendar, which is all the more amazing when you remember that these are kids who are just barely hitting puberty! So far, weve sold over 20,000 copies in our community alone, Jason said. Its just exciting to think of all the dialogue this calendar is creating. And all we had to do was take our clothes off. So cool! Its truly remarkable to see young people like these seventh-graders set their minds to making a difference in such a creative way. "

In a press release explaining its decision, Times editorial board wrote, Even though his quest for the Presidency was unsuccessful, Mr. Romneys ideas about foreign policy, taxation, wealth inequality, and womens rights typified the year 1912 as no one else has. In giving Mr. Romney the nod, Time said that he beat out such other candidates for Man of the Year 1912 as Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and Edward Smith, captain of the Titanic. It was very close between Romney and the Titanic guy, but we gave it to Romney because it took him slightly longer to sink, Time wrote.

After Gov. Perry and the Fox News host Sean Hannity toured the Rio Grande on Thursday, news quickly spread that the two men were actually among the most powerful in America, fueling the immigrants impression that the U.S. is a place where anyone can make it. When we learned that these two men were the governor of a large state and a top broadcaster from a major news network, it seemed too incredible to be true, said an immigrant from Honduras, speaking on the condition of anonymity. We all said to ourselves, if those two can succeed in America, imagine the wondrous things we might achieve. According to a border official, immigration at the border shot up eighty per cent since the appearance by the two men, and the situation could get even worse.

According to Fox, the President peppered his Oval Office guest with detailed questions about the mechanics of setting up a monarchy and was curious about the perks and powers that go along with it. Obamas guest advised him that establishing a monarchy would probably require rewriting or even replacing the Constitution, an option that Obama reportedly said would be difficult, but doable. Introducing a note of caution, the guest urged the President to alter the Constitution so that it vested the monarch with genuine power, adding, You dont want to wind up being a figurehead who just goes around visiting foreign dignitaries and so forth.

0,"The Berlin Wall was finally opened in 1989 and demolished by 1992, effectively lifting the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe for decades. This appeared to be a major blow to walls, and yet more than two decades later, walls are still with us. Why? 1. The Berlin Wall was only one wall: In the late 1980s, there were many walls in the world, and the Berlin Wall was not all of them. Instead, it was just one of them. The long-term consequences of this fact were far-reaching and various, but the most significant was that when the Berlin Wall was destroyed, only one wall was destroyed. 2. Not all walls are connected to each other: Though the Berlin Wall was very long, it was not so long that it joined up with all other walls in the world. If this had been so, theres a chance that demolishing the Berlin Wall would have ended walls forever, and today wed be living in a world without walls. But it was not to be. 3. Some walls are not even in Germany: The Berlin Wall was in Germany, with no part of the wall extending beyond the countrys borders. On the other hand, the same cannot be said of all walls. For example, the continued existence of walls like the Great Wall of China, which was and is in China, further proves that the fall of one wall in Germany never truly threatened walls in general. 4. People are always building walls: Beginning well before the Berlin Walls demolition, people have built walls to ensure separation between areas. The need for separate spaces, such as rooms, continued despite the destruction of the Berlin Wall, and even today, work on thousands of new walls across the world is underway. The continued construction of walls was a major factor that ensured that the fall of the Berlin Wall did not spell doom for all walls. 5. Reagan demanded that Gorbachev tear down this wall, not tear down all walls: Perhaps history would have played out differently had Ronald Reagan, in his famous 1987 speech at the Brandenburg Gate, called for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down every single wall in the world, but this was not how it happened. The president limited his request to this wall, referring to the Berlin Wall. 6. There are many kinds of walls: The Berlin Wall was a specific type of wall known as a border wall, but there are other types of walls as well. The urgent political and social forces that precipitated the demolition of the Berlin Wall failed to exert the same influence on retaining walls, seawalls, or glass partition walls. Partly for this reason, countless such walls stand to this day. "
0,"Saying that the American people are fed up with a disastrous Web site that doesnt work and never will, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) and a phalanx of congressional Republicans today unveiled their own health-care Web site, EmergencyRoom.gov. At EmergencyRoom.gov, every American can access the one tried-and-true health-care system that has worked in this country for decades, he said. While Healthcare.gov has frustrated many users with its difficult-to-navigate design, Rep. Cantor said that at EmergencyRoom.gov, Health care is just three easy steps away. One: enter your zip code. Two: see the list of emergency rooms. Three: get to the nearest one before you die. The Virginia Republican wasted no time touting the cost savings of EmergencyRoom.gov, comparing it favorably with the notoriously expensive Obamacare site: Unlike Healthcare.gov, which private contractors built at a cost running into the hundreds of millions, EmergencyRoom.gov was built for nine hundred dollars by my intern Josh. And in contrast with Healthcare.govs maze of forms, links, and phone numbers, he said, EmergencyRoom.gov has just one phone number: 9-1-1. In what may be the strongest selling point for the new site, Rep. Cantor said that the wait time on EmergencyRoom.gov is virtually nonexistent, not counting the twelve to thirty-six hours spent in the actual emergency room. "

Billy Coldane, who traveled from Bullitt County, Kentucky, to attend the War on Women, was just one of many Republicans who said they were disgusted by the Partys decision. The Party is saying theyre doing this because of an act of God, but postponing the War on Women is the exact opposite of what God would want, he said. Sometimes I wonder if Republicans are really serious about defeating women. He worried that postponing the War on Women because of a little hundred-mile-per-hour wind might be seen by the Partys enemies as a sign of weakness: Theres rotten weather every December and you dont see Obama postponing the War on Christmas.

0,"Well, that was a close call. According to his representatives, Harrison Ford is stable and recovering in the hospital after eating an extremely spicy chili pepper. The Star Wars actor was dining in an upscale French restaurant when he stole a large red pepper off a passing tray and gulped it down whole, causing his head to explode into a fiery mushroom cloud. Although it is unclear why Ford wanted to eat the pepper, we do know that it took several seconds for him to realize how hot it was. At first, he simply smacked his lips in satisfaction, not realizing that a red thermometer line was slowly creeping up his body from his feet toward his head accompanied by the sound of a rising slide whistle. Then, Ford shrieked like a boiling teapot, and he belched a jet of fire out of his mouth that struck the restaurants snooty matre d and incinerated the poor bystander into a pile of ash with a pair of blinking eyeballs. With increasing panic, Ford ran onto the wall and traveled around the room in circles, his footprints leaving a trail of fire behind him, and leapt through a closed window to try to extinguish his blazing head in the cool water of a horse trough outside the building. Unfortunately, the water instantly evaporated into steam as he plunged his head in, providing no relief whatsoever. Witnesses said that at this point, Ford mistook an open barrel of turpentine for water and dived inside, a decision that only exacerbated the situation because the fluid caused his entire body to burst into flames. Ford then howled like an angry bobcat and a plume of fire blasted out of his buttocks, propelling the A-lister into outer space. Seconds after leaving orbit, Ford collided with Saturns rings, causing them to quickly spin around the planet. The Hollywood legend then proceeded to bounce off into an asteroid field, rapidly ricocheting from asteroid to asteroid, making them all light up and ring like pinball machine bumpers. Eventually, Ford plummeted down to Earth as a glowing white comet, landing in Antarctica and melting the entire continents ice cap with a loud hiss. As the ice melted, it revealed a beautiful beach with palm trees and tiki huts, and all the penguins took advantage of their new tropical paradise by donning Hawaiian swim trunks and going surfing. Rescue workers eventually found Ford at the bottom of a man-shaped hole in the center of a mile-wide impact crater. After they aided him in climbing out, onlookers said that the Blade Runner star looked frazzled, but that he managed to hold up a tiny white sign saying Help, signaling that he was still conscious. A tweet from Fords son confirmed that the actor avoided serious injury and is on the mend: Heres wishing you a speedy recovery, Harrison! Get well soon. "
0,"The third and final Presidential debate ended in dramatic fashion tonight as President Obama punched Republican nominee Mitt Romney in the face, knocking him unconscious before a national television audience. As Mr. Romney lay motionless on the floor at Lynn University with 35:06 remaining in regulation, moderator Bob Schieffer declared the debate over, calling Mr. Obamas punch a clean shot. The Presidents uncharacteristic explosion of anger came after Mr. Romney repeatedly needled him about going on a global apology tour on behalf of the U.S. As the former Massachusetts Governor continued his harangue, TV viewers witnessed Mr. Obama glaring at his Republican opponent, a vein visibly throbbing on the Presidents forehead. Still, few observers were prepared for the sight of Mr. Obama leaping across the table and cold-cocking Mr. Romney, dropping him to the floor. Moments later, Vice-President Joe Biden jumped onstage to congratulate Mr. Obama with a jubilant high-five. You literally cleaned his clock, Mr. Biden said. I only wish Id done the same thing to that punk Ryan. After the debate, the usually mild-mannered Obama was at pains to explain why exactly he had struck Mr. Romney in the face: I guess I just couldnt take it any more, and I sort of snapped. It wasnt optimal. But he was being such a dick. Minutes after Mr. Romney was carried out on a stretcher, the debate was declared a victory for Mr. Obama by all the major networks except Fox News, who called it a draw. "
0,"Coining a phrase that seems destined to become his new campaign slogan, Mitt Romney needed only three words tonight to accept the Republican Presidential nomination: I bought it. Those words had a special meaning for Mr. Romney, who had to spend seventy million dollars in the G.O.P. primaries to defeat a serial adulterer, a former pizza executive, and a crackpot in a sweater-vest. It has been an up-and-down convention for Mr. Romney, who was largely ignored at Tea Party rallies early in the week but later picked up a key endorsement from his wife. Tonight, however, was a time to reflect, as he put it, on money well spent. Our opponents say that America is in decline, that it is no longer number one, he said. I say our democracy is the best that money can buy. Mr. Romney braided his speech with the theme of I bought it, reminding his audience that in order to take the White House, I have millions to go before I sleep. He made an emotional appeal to a group he called the single-issue billionaires, imploring them, Let me know what you want. Eliminate the E.P.A.? Bomb Iran? Mitt Romney is open for business. The audience roared its approval. Mr. Romney made one reference to his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.): Dont let his crazy rock-and-roll playlist fool you. Hes serious about the important things: cutting taxes for the rich and ending Planned Parenthood. Ultimately, he ended his speech with a rousing call to arms that brought the Republican audience to its feet: The road to the White House will be hard, and strewn with challenges. But together, theres nothing we cant buy. "

0,"With an official announcement on his campaign Web site, Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has joined a crowded field of people who will never be elected President in their lifetimes. While Paul and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are the only officially announced Republican candidates with a zero-per-cent chance of ever winning the Presidency, a burgeoning roster of totally pointless candidacies is waiting in the wings. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are just a few of the men thought to be considering squandering time and money pursuing an office that they will never occupy in a billion years. On the Democratic side, only former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley has stepped forward as someone who could only be elected to the White House in an alternate universe. Minutes after his announcement, aides to Senator Paul said that they believed that he would emerge as the top choice of voters who are determined to waste their votes in 2016. Theres no one out there who has a more remote chance of being elected, unless Trump decides to run, one aide said. "
0," The Vaticans plan to call the retiring pontiff Benedict XVI Pope Emeritus hit a snag today, in the form of a threatened lawsuit by an Oakland-based rapper who has been recording under that name since 2006. I dont care who he is, I aint let nobody mess with my brand, said Mr. Emeritus, who prior to 2006 recorded under the name Notorious P.O.P.E. While the Vatican said it was unaware that Mr. Emeritus had already claimed the name seven years ago, the Oakland rapper scoffed at that idea: They should have done what I did before I picked it out: Google it. Furious at what he is calling a clear case of trademark infringement, Mr. Emeritus said that he has no intention of stepping aside for the former pontiff: Hes the one who should step aside. Call himself P. Biddy or something. This is wack, yo. According to a source close to the Vatican, Benedict is likely to choose another name for himself rather than risk a legal tussle with the aggrieved rapper: The last thing the Church needs right now is another lawsuit.

0,"Its time to celebrate, because the U.S. surgeon general is getting a major moment in the sun. The Department of Health and Human Services announced this morning that starting next week, all cigarette packs will feature an expanded health warning label where Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy will get to write about anything thats on his mind! Cigarette packs featuring the first installment of the new serialized warning label are in production today and will hit convenience store shelves later this week. The HHS released images of the surgeon generals full column this morning: Awesome! Heres hoping the surgeon generals future dispatches turn out to be as amusing as this thought-provoking debut. Either way, its great that hes finally getting a space to spread his wings. Write on, surgeon! "
0,"Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) shared more folksy stories of her childhood on Wednesday, telling reporters that she used to wear a bucket on her head for no apparent reason. Id be walking outside our house and see a bucket lying there, and Id say to myself, Thats a perfectly good bucket, I think Ill put it on my head, she said. It wasnt because I needed a hat or anything. I must have had, oh gosh, a half-dozen hats or so. I just wanted to wear a bucket. Ernst said that during her youth, she was known for poking a hole in a large piece of corrugated cardboard and wearing it as a poncho. I cant for the life of me tell you why I did that, she said. I just liked the look of it, I guess. Nobody paid much attention to it. People sure dont notice your cardboard poncho when youre wearing a bucket on your head. When asked why she was sharing these stories, Sen. Ernst considered her answer carefully. I think people like to get to know their representatives in Washington as people, she said. And it helps to know that one of them used to wear buckets on her head, corrugated cardboard ponchos, and scuba flippers instead of gloves. Did I tell you I used to wear scuba flippers instead of gloves? To this day Ill be darned if I know why I did that. "
0,"Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) was harshly critical today of President Obamas nationally televised address about Syria this week, telling CNNs Wolf Blitzer, The Presidents decision to think before attacking another country flies in the face of American foreign policy. The United States of America has been involved in countless armed conflicts since this great nation was founded, Mr. McCain said. Many of those would never have happened if wed stopped to think about them first. Sadly, the President seems not to have learned this lesson of history. Calling the President an Ivy League law professor who never met a thought he didnt like, Mr. McCain said that he was urging Mr. Obama to please take thinking off the table. The stakes for America couldnt be higher right now, he said. Our global reputation for rushing into war with no advance planning is hanging by a thread. Mr. McCain said that he is attempting to schedule a meeting in the Oval Office, where he plans to deliver a strong and clear message to Mr. Obama: Mr. President, what you are doing is playing into the hands of the enemy. Thinking solves nothing. "
0,"Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, told reporters today that his reported purchase of the Washington Post was a gigantic mix-up, explaining that he had clicked on the newspaper by mistake. I guess I was just kind of browsing through their website and not paying close attention to what I was doing, he said. No way did I intend to buy anything. Mr. Bezos said he had been oblivious to his online shopping error until earlier today, when he saw an unusual charge for two hundred and fifty million dollars on his American Express statement. After investigating with the credit-card company, he was informed that he had been charged for the purchase price of the entire Washington Post, which, he said, was pure craziness. No way in hell would I buy the Washington Post, he said. I dont even read the Washington Post. Mr. Bezos said he had been on the phone with the Posts customer service for the better part of the day trying to unwind his mistaken purchase, but so far theyve really been giving me the runaround. According to Mr. Bezos, I keep telling them, I dont know how it got in my cart. I dont want it. Its like theyre making it impossible to return it. "
0,"News that Karl Roves PAC, American Crossroads, has bought ads attacking Hillary Clinton has sent the Democrats stock soaring in Las Vegas, where oddsmakers now say she is virtually guaranteed to be the next President of the United States. People were bullish on Hillary before this, said Tracy Klugian, a leading Las Vegas oddsmaker for over forty years. But the Rove thing makes it a lock. After American Crossroadss historic string of defeats in 2012, Serious gamblers wait to see who Rove is supporting and then bet the house on the other side. The oddsmakers only concern, he added, was that Roves involvement in the race will dry up all interest in betting on Republican candidates for 2016: Right now Im offering Marco Rubio at ninety thousand to one and I aint getting a bite. While acknowledging that theres no sure thing in the world of gambling, Mr. Klugian said that for professional gamblers, betting against Karl Rove is as good as it gets. Hes the LeBron James of losing, he said. "
0," Media advisers to former Governor Jeb Bush are hoping to exploit nostalgia for what is widely seen as the greatest era in American history, the years 2001 to 2009. Tracy Klugian, who heads the newly assembled Bush media team, said that he and his staff are poised to tap into the nations longing for a time when everything in this country seemed to be going right. A centerpiece of the marketing strategy will be evoking memories of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Its been a long time since the United States has invaded another country for no reason, he said. People are sentimental about those simpler times. Additionally, Klugian and his fellow Bush marketers hope to remind Americans of a chapter in our history that showed what this nation was made of: Hurricane Katrina. A lot of people are nostalgic about the way the government didnt panic about Katrina and instead took its time to come up with a response, he said. I think when we look back on those days, we all say, Heck of a job. Finally, Klugian said, the Bush team hopes to rekindle Americans memories of one of those most exciting times in recent history, the financial meltdown of 2008. Seeing the financial system teeter on the brink of Armageddon was a thrill ride we havent experienced the likes of since, he said. I know Im not alone when I say that I miss those days. All in all, Klugian said that he and the Bush team cant wait to roll up their sleeves and start reminding America of the glories that were the years 2001 to 2009. When you have a great story like the Bush story, its hard to know where to start, he said. "
0,"The so-called polar vortex caused hundreds of injuries across the Midwest today, as people who said so much for global warming and similar comments were punched in the face. Authorities in several states said that residents who had made ignorant comments erroneously citing the brutally cold temperatures as proof that climate change did not exist were reporting a sharp increase in injuries to the face and head regions. In an emergency room in St. Paul, Harland Dorrinson, forty-one, was waiting to be treated for bruising to the facial area after he made a crack about how the below-freezing temperatures meant that climate-change activists were full of shit. Id just finished saying it and boom, out of nowhere someone punched me in the face, he said. This polar vortex is really dangerous. The meteorology professor Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, issued a safety warning to residents of the states hammered by the historic low temperatures: If you are living within the range of the polar vortex and you have something idiotic to say about climate change, do not leave your house.

0,"As the Supreme Court prepared to hear two cases involving same-sex marriage this week, Justice Antonin Scalia said that he would not allow his votes to be influenced in any way by his lifelong fear of gays. As Justices of the Supreme Court, we have a sacred duty to check our personal feelings at the door, he told the Fox News Channel. In my case, that means putting aside my longstanding and profound fear of homosexuals. Justice Scalia added that he was committed to safeguarding the rights of all Americanseven those I personally find terrifying. I take my role as an impartial arbiter very seriously, he said. So when I hear a case, I put all feelings of abhorrence, disgust, and revulsion completely out of my mind. The Justice said that when it came to the issue of same-sex marriage he would rely on the Constitution, which makes no mention of gays whatsoever. Remember, when the framers wrote the Constitution, there were no gays in America, he said. They didnt come here until the nineteen-sixties. All in all, he said, advocates of same-sex marriage should rest assured that he will listen to this weeks arguments with an open mind: Im going to apply the same robust sense of fairness that Ive brought to cases involving blacks and women.

0,"Arguing that their recent trip to Cuba had made them Americas No. 1 national-security threat, a group of Republican lawmakers today called for tougher sanctions on the entertainers Beyonc and Jay-Z. We must send a strong message to Beyonc and Jay-Z that the United States of America will not tolerate this kind of provocation, said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Florida), who blamed President Obama for permitting the crisis to escalate dangerously. While the President has allowed himself to be distracted by North Korea, Beyonc and Jay-Z were engaged in threatening activities right in our own hemisphere, he said, charging the President with being soft on Beyonc. Echoing his sentiments, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called for the toughest economic sanctions possible to isolate the growing threat posed by Beyonc and Jay-Z. But while economic sanctions may be politically popular, White House spokesman Jay Carney cautioned that they would probably have little to no effect: Right now, Jay-Z and Beyonc have more money than the U.S. government does.

0,"When it comes to womens reproductive rights, battle lines have been drawn. With the controversy surrounding funding for Planned Parenthood reaching the forefront of the national dialogue, many companies have decided that remaining silent is no longer an option. Thats why, this week, Dunkin Donuts sent a clear message by announcing that it will be performing one abortion. Message received! We feel strongly about womens health and want to stand in solidarity with the millions of women across the country who deserve the right to choose, said a press release from the donut and coffee shop chain. Thats why were giving one Dunkin Donuts customer a complimentary abortion, which will be performed by a licensed physician in one of our more than 8,000 U.S. locations. Well be taking all measures to ensure the environment will be sterile and completely safe for the procedure, the statement continued. In addition, the patient will receive a free egg and cheese sandwich and a medium coffee. Wow! Talk about a powerful statement. The move has already struck a chord with many internet users: How do you feel about this game-changer from Dunkin Donuts? Use #DunkinAbortion and weigh in with your thoughts! "
0,"Pope Emeritus Benedicts return to the Vatican began on a sour note today as the current Pope, Francis, reprimanded him for rolling his eyes sarcastically during meetings, observers said. The trouble started when the former Pope showed up at a meeting Francis scheduled to discuss plans for his Christmas mass, a meeting that Benedict wasnt even invited to, a Vatican source said. It was awkward, the source said. Francis started talking about making an appeal to the worlds poor, and then Benedict started sighing in this really loud and obnoxious way. After about ten minutes of suffering through Benedicts sighing and eye-rolling, Francis totally called him out on it, the source said, adding, What Benedict was doing was totally disrespectful. Plus, he is supposed to be retired, so he shouldnt have been wearing his Pope costume. Reached at his apartment at the Vatican, Benedict downplayed the incident, saying he was just trying to be helpful. Look, Francis is insecureI get that, he said. Hes new at being Pope and its not surprising that hes making so many mistakes. Once he checks his ego at the door, I think hell thank his lucky stars that old Benedict is around to back him up. Sources said that Benedict ignited tensions upon his return to Vatican City earlier this week when he posted a sign outside his residence reading Home of the Original Pope. "
0,"Two days after voting against the Paycheck Fairness Act, a law that would help women to obtain equal pay, the four female Republicans in the United States Senate co-sponsored a bill that would slash their salaries to seventy-one per cent of what their male colleagues earn. The senatorsKelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)said that the best way to take a stand against big governments intrusive attempts to mandate equal pay for women was to take a twenty-nine-per-cent pay cut themselves. The days of the federal government forcing us to earn as much as male senators are over, Ayotte said. We will not stop fighting until we make twenty-nine per cent less. Fischer said that after voting down paycheck equity for women across America, the female Republican senators realized that they themselves were burdened by the tyranny of equal pay in the U.S. Senate. All we are asking for is the same freedom from equal pay that other American women enjoy, Ayotte said. Though the bill was just proposed on Wednesday morning, Murkowski said that it already has the unanimous support of male Republicans in the Senate. "
0,"On the eve of Facebooks I.P.O., founder and C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg published the following letter to potential investors: Dear Potential Investor: For years, youve wasted your time on Facebook. Now heres your chance to waste your money on it, too. Tomorrow is Facebooks I.P.O., and I know what some of you are thinking. How will Facebook be any different from the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s? For one thing, those bad dot-com stocks were all speculation and hype, and werent based on real businesses. Facebook, on the other hand, is based on a solid foundation of angry birds and imaginary sheep. Second, Facebook is the most successful social network in the world, enabling millions to share information of no interest with people they barely know. Third, every time someone clicks on a Facebook ad, Facebook makes money. And while no one has ever done this on purpose, millions have done it by mistake while drunk. We totally stole this idea from iTunes. Finally, if you invest in Facebook, youll be far from alone. As a result of using Facebook for the past few years, over nine hundred million people in the world have suffered mild to moderate brain damage, impairing their ability to make reasoned judgments. These will be your fellow Facebook investors. With your help, if all goes as planned tomorrow, Facebooks I.P.O. will net a hundred billion dollars. To put that number in context, it would take JP Morgan four or five trades to lose that much money. One last thing: What will, I, Mark Zuckerberg, do with the eighteen billion dollars Im expected to earn from Facebooks I.P.O.? Well, Im considering buying Greece, but that would still leave me with eighteen billion dollars. LOL. Friend me, Mark "
0," A new poll released Thursday reveals that a broad majority of Americans describe themselves as deeply unhappy to have been reminded that the former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin exists. Palins call for the impeachment of President Obama, a ploy to remind people that she still roams the earth, appears to have backfired, the poll shows. With seventy-two per cent of respondents saying that they were upset or very upset to be reminded of her existence, Palin is one of three non-officeholders whose recent utterances have traumatized Americans. According to the poll, eighty-one per cent were upset to be reminded that Ann Coulter exists, while a hundred per cent felt that way about the existence of the former Vice-President Dick Cheney. "
0," With a stop in Iowa on Tuesday, the Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton officially embarked on a nineteen-month marathon of looking concerned. Sitting with patrons at Jones Street Java House, in Le Claire, the former Secretary of State listened intently, sipped from a cup of coffee, and nodded her head at appropriate junctures, flawlessly renacting a brief scene from her first campaign video. After about twenty minutes of virtually nonstop displays of empathy, a Clinton aide said, we decided to shut it down. Hillary is staring down nineteen months of sipping coffee and nodding her head, the aide continued. We want to make sure she paces herself. After her Iowa visit, Clinton is scheduled to bring her looks of concern to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other early primary states. "
0,"Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is steadily rising to the top of the 2016 Republican Presidential field because voters are connecting with his strong and consistent opposition to knowledge, an aide to Walker said on Thursday. While Republican candidates of the past, such as Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann, have capitalized on G.O.P. voters hostility toward verifiable facts, the aide said, Compared to Scott, those two look like rookies. Walker has burnished his anti-knowledge credentials in Wisconsin by proposing a three-hundred-million-dollar cut in the University of Wisconsins funding and by deleting the phrase the search for truth from the values outlined in the universitys mission statement. That truth thing was a masterstroke, the aide said. Our polling shows that voters who oppose knowledge also have negative feelings about truth. But Walkers longstanding opposition to knowledge may have faced its toughest test during a visit to London, on Wednesday, when an interviewer asked him if he believed in evolution and he refused to answer. He tried to trick Governor Walker into admitting that he knew something, and Scott didnt take the bait, the aide said. I was watching him do that and I was like, Nailed it. Moments like that, the aide said, show why Walker will win the White House in 2016. The American people are sick and tired of a President who knows things, he said. Theyre ready for Scott. "
0,"Responding to fresh charges that he knew about the controversial lane closures on the George Washington Bridge last fall, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie today asked for the publics patience while he makes up a new story. Today you have heard some allegations that are shocking and explosive, he told reporters at a hastily called press conference. All I ask is that the people of the great state of New Jersey give me sufficient time to invent a new story that explains my way out of this. Governor Christie said that he had spent the past few hours in closed-door meetings trying to come up with a new narrative that absolves him of any guilt in the bridge scandal, but while he was definitely denying the allegations, so far, we dont have a winner. Weve been tossing around everything from my not remembering events correctly to my having a bad reaction to medication, he said. We even floated the idea of my being under too much pressure and having to blow off steam. As I said, we dont have a winner yet. But I want to reassure the people of New Jersey that I am working very hard on this. The Governor said he understood that things dont look very good for me right now, but he urged the public against rushing to judgment, adding, I will get back to you with a well-crafted and plausible story as soon as possible.

0,"In a defiant statement, a spokesman for the fast-food industry today lashed out at fast-food workers outrageous and unacceptable demand to be considered human beings. Arguing that granting fast food workers anything beyond a grim, scraping existence would put a serious dent in our profits, the Fast Food Restaurant Council spokesman Tracy Klugian said. Considering our workers human would be ruinous to the fast food industry as we know it. But Mr. Klugian was quick to point out that the controversy was about more than money: Its about dignity and respecttwo things this industry has zero tolerance for. As fast food workers mounted protests across the country, the industry spokesman urged them to abandon their reckless quest for human status at once. They have to ask themselves, why did they want to work in the fast food industry to begin with? he said. Anyone who walks into one of our restaurants should realize that its no place for humans. "
0,"A riveting scene unfolded in Congress today as a tearful Speaker John Boehner took to the floor of the House to tell his colleagues, I dont want to live in a world where seven million people get affordable health care. Tears streaming down his cheeks, Rep. Boehner appeared unable to maintain his composure as he delivered a speech interrupted by blubbering and sharp intakes of breath. What kind of a world is it where anyone can go on the Internet and get health care they can afford? he said. Not a world Id care to live in, or leave to my children. Its not right and its not America, he said, breaking down. Later, dabbing his eyes, a still-sobbing Boehner apologized to reporters for losing it up there. I dont like to get so emotional, he said. But when seven million people signed up for Obamacare, a part of me died. "
0,"Fox News announced on Wednesday that it is terminating its coverage of the Ebola virus effective immediately, because, in the words of the host Sean Hannity, Our work is done. Hannity commended the work of the Fox Ebola team, which provided non-stop coverage of the virus during the month of October, but added, This story is officially over. Foxs decision to bring its Ebola coverage to such an abrupt close raised eyebrows in media circles, but Hannity offered an explanation for the move after his broadcast concluded. Theres like, what, one case of Ebola in the United States? the host said. At most, two or three. The point is, the chances of any of our viewers catching Ebola are next to zero. Were not in the business of scaring people for no reason. Lets all move on. Hannity added that if there is an Ebola outbreak in the U.S., Fox would offer in-depth coverage of the crisis, probably in the fall of 2016. "
0,"According to a format negotiated between the Republican National Committee and the television networks, future Presidential debates during the 2016 campaign will strictly forbid questions about things the candidates said or did, the R.N.C. confirmed on Monday. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the R.N.C., said that the deal addressed the candidates concerns about the previously broadcast debates, which he called abusively fact-based. In some cases, moderators were asking candidates questions about statements they made two or three weeks earlier, Priebus said. This new format will eliminate that kind of ancient history. Priebus said that the new format would satisfy not only the candidates but also Republican voters, many of whom have complained about moderators out-of-control obsession with verifiable information. This is a Presidential debate, Priebus said. If people want facts, they can watch Jeopardy. In the new format, the time previously allotted to questions about things the candidates said or did will now be devoted to questions written by the candidates themselves and read, verbatim, by the moderators. Carly Fiorina would very much like to answer the question, How has your experience as the most successful C.E.O. in U.S. history uniquely prepared you to be its greatest President? Priebus said. This new format will let her speak to that. "
0," Telling Congress, Its O.K., I dont mind doing everything myself, President Obama prepared to sign a passive-aggressive executive order on Tuesday. While the President did not disclose details about the executive order, he told reporters, Im sure Congress is busy with a lot of other things and doesnt want to be bothered with stuff thats important to me. Really, they shouldnt give it a moments thought. Im happy to do the work of the entire government myself. After news of the Presidents passive-aggressive executive order reached Capitol Hill, House Speaker John Boehner prepared a narcissistic reply. Instead of signing more executive orders, President Obama needs to recognize that everything that happens in this government must begin and end with me, he said. At the White House, President Obama reacted to the Speakers narcissistic statement with a strongly worded passive-aggressive response. I hope that I havent troubled John Boehner in the slightest by sitting at my desk twenty hours a day doing the work of the entire country, he said, sighing heavily. The last thing in the world that I want is anybodys help. "
0,"Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanfords stunning upset in a special congressional election on Tuesday served as an inspiration to liars across the state and beyond, prominent members of the lying community said tonight. In America, liars are always made to feel bad about ourselves, as if what were doing is wrong, said Harland Dorrinson, fifty-seven, a liar from suburban Charleston. Mark Sanfords victory tonight is a victory for the lying lifestyle. Carol Foyler, thirty-six, a liar from Myrtle Beach, echoed those sentiments: For the millions of dishonest children across America, tonight Mark Sanford has given them hope that someday, they can be somebody. At his victory rally in Charleston, the former governor acknowledged the liars in the audience and said that his victory sent an important message: Every lie, no matter how big or small, has value. As your Governor, I abused your trust. And as God is my witness, as your congressman, I will abuse it again, he said, to thunderous applause. Mr. Sanford, who had been behind in the polls in the waning weeks of the race, owed much of his last-minute surge to the support of the lying community, exit polls showed. According to those exit polls, Mr. Sanford held a three-to-one lead among voters who described themselves as liars, cheaters, or sleazebags. Furthermore, the polls showed, those same voters felt that Mr. Sanfords opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, did not have the lying experience necessary to serve in Congress. "
0,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump was crying foul on Monday after Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders allegedly dispatched an army of vegan thugs to attack a rally of peace-loving Nazis in Cincinnati. According to Trump, he had begun to address a group of orderly and civil Nazis at a downtown arena when his audience was suddenly set upon by an unruly mob of angry vegans, many menacingly clad in Birkenstocks and sustainable garments. The Sanders supporters, singing an alarmingly militant version of Simon & Garfunkels America, marched into the arena and began intimidating and threatening the Nazis, Trump said. Make no mistake about who is starting the violence at these rallies, Trump said. Its the vegans. Carol Foyler, a Nazi from suburban Cincinnati, said that she feared for her life when one of the vegans ripped a Trump sign from her hands and tried to recycle it. Harland Dorrinson, a Kentucky Nazi who drove to Ohio to hear Trump speak, said he would never have attended the rally if he had known there would be troublemaking vegans there. One of them tried to swing an NPR tote bag at my head, the terrified Nazi said. Watch:Meet the father of Times Square fixture the Naked Cowboy. "
0,"It seems like just about every day theres another awful thing happening somewhere. But heres one story that will completely brighten your day: Its been over 150 years since the Irish Potato Famine ended. Its confirmed: There is still good in the world! Sure, every time you turn on the news theres another story about escalating violence or terrorism or poverty, but at least Ireland has been steadily producing potatoes for the past 163 years. Ready for even better news? Ireland has so many potatoes that it actually exports them now! Still feeling down? Well, picture this: Abraham Lincoln was just a U.S. representative from Illinois the last time the Irish had anything approaching a problem with their potato crop. The Wright brothers werent even alive yet, and there were only 31 states in the Union. Thats how long the Irish have had healthy, beautiful potatoes. If that doesnt bring a smile to your face, we dont know what will. And heres an extra jolt of feel-goodery: The amount of time since the Irish Potato Famine happened is actually INCREASING every day. That means that in a few years, it will be 167 years since the Irish Potato Famine. And just a few years after that? It will be 173 years since the famine. We dont know about you, but we cant wait until the Irish Potato Famine is even further in the past! So, next time you see something in the news that gets you down, just remember that there hasnt been a potato crisis in Ireland in well over a century and a half. No matter how bad things get in the world, you can at least feel better knowing that Irish families have potatoes on their dinner platesso many that they probably cant even eat them all! Share this story to spread the good feels! "
0,"The following open letter to America was published today by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum: My Fellow Americans: I am writing to you today to endorse Mitt Romney for President of the United States. Now, some of you may recall that during the campaign, I took a slightly different position on Mitt Romney. In fact, I said that Mitt Romney was the worst person in America to run against Barack Obama for President. Well, theres nothing wrong with changing your mind. In fact, as Mitt Romney himself has proved, changing your mind is the surest path to the Republican nomination. LOL. Why do I no longer think Mitt Romney is the worst person to run for President? Well, I started thinking about that Jet Blue pilot who went off his nut a few weeks ago and had to be tackled by passengers. That dude would definitely be a worse person to run for President than Mitt Romney. Say what you will about Mitt Romney and how he made his fortune by putting thousands of people out of work and how he invented Obamacare before Obama did and all, he has never jeopardized the lives of people on an airplane (that I know of). That is probably because he flies everywhere on a private jet, staffed entirely by undocumented workers. I also started thinking about Michael Vick. He was involved in some of the most despicable acts in recent memory, involving the deaths of multiple dogs. Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has only endangered the life of one dog, his own, and he didnt actually kill the dog, he just literally scared the shit out of it. So if you compare Mitt Romney to someone who has actually been responsible for the killing of dogs and not just scaring them to death, I would have to say Michael Vick would be slightly worse than him (although in some ways slightly better, since Michael Vick did not create Obamacare or have gays on his staff). In conclusion, my fellow Americans, Mitt Romney is a total douche. No ones arguing that he isnt. But if you compare him to either the insane Jet Blue guy or a heartless dog-killer like Michael Vick, Mitt Romney is no longer the worst person in America to run for President. I should add, however, that if anything should happen to Mitt Romney between now and November, such as him getting trapped in his Swiss bank vault with all his ill-gotten money and tragically suffocating to death, I stand ready and willing to be your nominee. Plus I am an actual Christian who does not believe in magic underpants. Vote for Romney, Rick Santorum "
0,"Prepare to be enraged. While most charities do work that is uplifting and positive, theres a new charity that is doing something truly awful. The charity is called Skys The Limit, and its mission is infuriating: providing convicted sex offenders with skydiving lessons absolutely free of charge. Just terrible. According to the organizations website, Skys The Limit has over 40 schools across the country and offers fully compensated classes for any person convicted of a sex-related misdemeanor or felony. The offenders are given a brief orientation covering the basics of skydiving before theyre taken to an altitude of 10,000 feet and paired with an instructor to do a tandem jump. After landing, theyre given a video of their dive that is shot from three camera angles and even a parachute decal for their carall at no cost. The charity is shockingly well-funded, has tax-exempt status as a nonprofit organization, and has already paid for hundreds of sex offenders to enjoy the excitement of skydiving for the first time. But it gets worse. Charity Navigator, a popular charity-rating site, gives Skys The Limit a four out of four star rating, citing its transparency and high percentage of donations going toward its programs. All of this is paid for by anonymous donors who could be giving their money to numerous other charities that actually do some good in the world. Yikes. If youre one of the many people out there who thinks sex offenders shouldnt even be getting a discount on their skydiving lessons, this news probably has you pretty upset. Unfortunately, as long as Skys The Limit isnt doing anything illegal, theres little that can be done to shut it down. We have to ask ourselves, what kind of society do we live in when children go hungry while sex offenders skydive for free? At this point, we can only hope that as awareness spreads, donations will dry up and sex offenders will end up having to pay to go skydiving like everyone else. "

The man, who was born in Calgary before drifting to Texas, has been spotted in Washington, D.C. in recent years exhibiting erratic behavior, sources said. In 2013, he gained entry to the United States Senate and was heard quoting incoherently from a childrens book before he was finally subdued. More recently, he was heard ranting about a plan to dismantle large components of the federal government, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the nations health-care program. Despite a record of such bizarre episodes and unhinged utterances, observers expressed little concern about his plans to get into the White House, calling them delusional. "
0,"Now that the government shutdown is over, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) plans to read the Affordable Care Act, he told reporters today. Its definitely been on my must-read list for a while now, Sen. Cruz said of the law often referred to as Obamacare. Things have just been so hectic around here lately, I couldnt get to it. The Texas Senator said that he started reading the law this morning and observed, So far, its pretty dry. Its not a page-turner, thats for sure, he said. But its caused so much controversy, it must have some pretty juicy stuff in it. Ill keep reading it and see what I find. Sen. Cruz said that when he finishes reading the Affordable Care Act, he plans to read the United States Constitution. People kept bringing it up the last few weeks, he said. So Im kind of curious to see what all the fuss is about. "
0,"Serial junkies, you might want to sit down for this one. Whether youre a longtime fan or just a casual listener, weve got some pretty big news. The second season of Serial has had no shortage of surprises thus far, but in just a few days, were going to get our biggest one yet. Thats right: The next episode will finally discuss the pie smell that lifted Bowe Bergdahl into the air and floated him away from his military post, and its going to be a doozy. Yeah, you read that right. After over six weeks of waiting, host Sarah Koenig is finally going to investigate the long, snakelike trail of steam that floated Bergdahl all the way from his bunker toward a pie located in the Afghan desert. According to NPR, the 60-minute episode will dissect the smells every movement, including its journey from the pie to the bases fence, and then to Bergdahls bed, where it ultimately formed into a finger, tapped him on the shoulder, and beckoned him to follow it. Unfortunately, Koenig says, after the warm smell slithered into his nostrils, thats where things start to get a little fuzzy. A teaser clip indicates that the vapor wrapped itself around Bergdahls head, turned his nose upward, and started lifting him slowly into the air. Then, as he floated headfirst toward the pie with his buttocks pointed upward, his limp body supposedly slipped past several unwitting guards, back over the barbed-wire fence, and into enemy territory. Immediately after his disappearance, he was captured by the Taliban and held for nearly five years. Needless to say, fans are hungry for answers: Well, heres what we do know: According to military sources, after Bergdahl went airborne, he floated over three miles off the base, licking his lips the entire time. At one point, the solider may have even put on a bib and pulled out a fork and knife in anticipation of his meal. Everything else? Looks like well have to wait until Thursday to find out. The pie smell episode of Serial will be available this Thursday. Until then, follow along with the hashtag #SerialPieSmell. "
0,"Faced with a barrage of new questions about the Affordable Care Act, President Obama cut short a White House press conference today, telling the stunned press corps, You know what? Everybody can keep their damn insurance. Glaring at the reporters, the President continued, You heard me. If your insurance is crappy, then you just go ahead and keep itthe crappier, the better. Lets pretend this whole thing never happened. A vein in his forehead visibly throbbing, the President added, You know, I really wish I hadnt spent the last three years of my life on this thing. I shouldve just gone around invading countries for no reason. That wouldve made everybody happy. Well, live and learn. As the reporters averted their eyes from the President, many of them looking awkwardly at their shoes, he concluded his remarks: All those people out there who want to repeal Obamacare? Well, guess what: Ill make their day and repeal it myself. Really, its my pleasure. But I swear that this is the last time I try to do something nice for anybody. "
0,"The White House today announced that it was offering a substantial cash reward for information leading to the location and safe return of President Obamas mojo. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced the search with an air of urgency: We will use every resource at our disposal to ensure the return of the Presidents mojo, and that goes double for his groove. Mr. Carney said that as of late Wednesday afternoon no one at the White House knew the Presidents mojo was missing, but minutes into last nights televised debate it became clear that something was terribly, horribly wrong. Even if the White House is successful in locating Mr. Obamas mojo, Mr. Carney acknowledged, it could take days or even weeks to get it working. In an effort to reboot his campaign, President Obama plans to announce some bold initiatives for his second term, including killing Osama bin Laden again. "
0,"President Obama used his weekly radio address on Saturday to reassure the American people that he has played no role whatsoever in the U.S. government over the past four years. Right now, many of you are angry at the government, and no one is angrier than I am, he said. Quite frankly, I am glad that I have had no involvement in such an organization. The Presidents outrage only increased, he said, when he recently became aware of a part of that government called the Department of Justice. The more I learn about the activities of these individuals, the more certain I am that I would not want to be associated with them, he said. They sound like bad news. Mr. Obama closed his address by indicating that beginning next week he would enforce what he called a zero tolerance policy on governing. If I find that any members of my Administration have had any intimate knowledge of, or involvement in, the workings of the United States government, they will be dealt with accordingly, he said.

0,"With each passing day, ISIS reaches new heights of ruthlessness and brutality, and the terrorist groups most recent campaign might be its most devastating yet. According to the CIA, ISIS has invested over $25 million attempting to recruit Elvis Costello. This is absolutely horrifying. Over the past 18 months, the Islamic State has attempted to secure Costellos undying allegiance through a sustained targeted recruitment campaign. The organization has sent Costello thousands of propaganda materials, including high-production recruitment videos that address the Grammy-winning recording artist by name and offer him high-ranking military positions in the event that he elects to become a member of ISIS. They have also emailed Costello hundreds of personalized messages promising eternal rewards in heaven if the celebrated songwriter martyrs himself for the glory of Allah. It appears that ISIS will stop at nothing to recruit the rock-and-roll icon. Just take a look at this photograph that ISIS released earlier this week: Sparing no expense in the campaign to radicalize Elvis Costello, ISIS has even constructed a $6 million recording studio in Syria that officials named The Imperial Bedroom, a tribute to Costellos 1982 album of the same name. The studio is stocked with state-of-the-art recording equipment, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared in a recent video to personally inform Costello that he would have exclusive access to the studio in exchange for his loyalty to the Islamic State. It looks like the situation is truly dire. Hopefully, ISIS can be stopped before it fully radicalizes Elvis Costello. Until then, the media barrage continues to intensify as ISIS tries everything in its power to turn the former Attractions bandleader to its violent extremist cause. "
0,"Tensions over the so-called fiscal cliff reached a boiling point today as House Speaker John Boehner accused President Obama of acting like he won the November election. Our message is clear: Mr. President, we are ready to negotiate with you, Mr. Boehner told reporters. But this nonsense of acting like you won the election has got to stop. Lashing out at Mr. Obamas delusional arrogance, Mr. Boehner added, I dont know what planet he thinks he won an election on, but this whole the American people elected me act is getting a little old. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed Mr. Boehners sentiments, stating, The Presidents budget proposal sounds like the ravings of a man who thinks he won fifty-one per cent of the popular vote and three hundred and thirty-two electoral votes. When he decides its finally time to return to Realityville, he knows where to find us. Sen. McConnell denied earlier reports that he burst out laughing when he heard Mr. Obamas latest budget proposal, telling reporters, Actually, it would be more accurate to say I peed myself. That business about raising taxes on the rich waspardon my Frenchfreaking hilarious, Sen. McConnell said. Im glad that losing the election hasnt made the President lose his sense of humor.

0,"Thousands of Iraqis poured out into the streets to celebrate in the early hours of Sunday morning, as the threat of a third Bush Presidency was declared over at last. Iraqis, on edge about the prospect of another Bush in the White House since former Governor Jeb Bush entered the race last year, had been watching returns from the South Carolina primary with a mixture of anxiety and cautious optimism. Moments after the first evidence of Bushs dismal finish began trickling in, however, Iraqis roared with glee as spontaneous festivities erupted across the country. Observers were stunned to see Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds dancing together in the streets, putting aside their enmity to celebrate an outcome that they never dreamed possible. You must understand, we Iraqis have been living with the fear of a third Bush Presidency for months now, Sabah al-Alousi, a Baghdad shoemaker, said. Now we can begin to think about a future, for ourselves and our families. Asked about the possibility of a Trump Presidency, he waved off the question. This is the greatest day for my country, he said. I will let nothing spoil this day. "
0,"The Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruzs constant references to Jesus Christ in his speeches and campaign ads are sparking a strong interest in atheism among millions of Americans, atheist leaders report. Since Sen. Cruz (R-Texas) announced his candidacy two weeks ago with the words God isnt done with America yet, a substantial number of Americans have begun seriously questioning the existence of God, said Carol Foyler, the executive director of the American Society of Atheists. Its been amazing, Foyler said. Were getting calls from people who are curious about atheism for the first time in their lives. And when we ask them what got them thinking about it, they all say the same thing: I just heard Ted Cruz talk. Foyler said that her group often notices a surge in atheism after natural disasters or other traumatic events that rattle peoples faith, but, she added, Weve never seen anything like Ted Cruz. After Cruz aired an Easter weekend campaign ad in which he spoke of the transformative power of Christ, Foyler said, Our phones were ringing off the hook. As an atheist, I naturally dont believe in the power of Christ to transform people, she said. But I definitely believe in the power of Ted Cruz to transform people into atheists. Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist and outspoken atheist, said that Cruzs ability to convert millions to atheism was nothing short of extraordinary. Ted Cruz has created more atheists in two weeks than I have in decades, Dawkins said. "
0,"With just forty-three days to go until the election, Mitt Romney is in a race against time to offend the few voters he has not already alienated, his campaign manager said today. So far, Mitts efforts to make voters dislike him have gone exactly as planned, said the campaign manager Matt Rhoades. But lets not kid ourselvesweve still got a few supporters out there and weve got to find ways to piss them off. As Mr. Romney embarked on a bus tour with the goal of spreading additional unease about his candidacy, his campaign manager reflected on a program of systematic alienation that has so far worked like clockwork. We really got the ball rolling at the Olympics, Mr. Rhoades said. I seriously doubted that Mitt could turn a visit to London into a show of international ineptitude, but he was like, Matt, trust meI can do this. Mr. Rhoades also credited the addition of Rep. Paul Ryan to the ticket for being invaluable in scaring off potential voters: Mitt knew he could get booed off the stage at the N.A.A.C.P., but it takes someone special to get booed off the stage at the A.A.R.P. The campaign manager acknowledged that there were a few hiccups in the plan to turn off voters, but that the Romney team worked quickly to fix them: At the Convention in Tampa, Clint Eastwood was planning to go out and read a prepared speech endorsing Mitt. I pulled him aside and said, Clint, that will ruin everything were trying to do here. Shout at a chair instead. And then we were golden. The secret video showing Mr. Romney at a fundraiser was another coup for the campaign, Mr. Rhoades said, adding, We actually shot that video ourselves and then leaked it to Mother Jones. It was the simplest way we could think of to take forty-seven per cent of the votes off the table. Mr. Rhoades admitted that he is gratified by how well the campaigns plan to offend different constituencies has worked so far, but with only six weeks to go until the election, they are leaving nothing to chance: This week, were releasing a video of Mitt swinging a cat by its tail.

0,"In an urgent memo to the field of G.O.P. Presidential candidates, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, praised them for their relentless personal attacks on Hillary Clinton, but warned that their hatred for the former Secretary of State might be peaking too early. Priebus called the candidates ongoing evisceration of Clinton magnificent, but expressed his concern that no human beings, even an impressive group like yourselves, could possibly sustain such a high intensity of throbbing hatred for an entire year and a half. Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint, he wrote. You need to leave some hate in the tank. In the conclusion of his memo, Priebus advised the candidates to take an occasional day off from hating Clinton so that they could return to despising her with renewed freshness and vigor. Responding to the R.N.C. directive, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that he understood Priebuss concerns, but assured him that, at the end of the day, they were groundless. Anyone who doesnt think Im capable of spewing an infinite stream of vitriol and bile doesnt know what Im made of, he said, pointing with pride to his long record of hating President Obama. "
0,"Goodbye, Norma Jeane. At 9:42 this morning, with friends and family gathered around her hospital bed, American pop-culture icon Marilyn Monroe would have peacefully passed away at 89 years old. Today, the blond bombshellwho changed an entire eras attitudes toward sexuality and fatally overdosed on barbiturates over 50 years agowould have seen the conclusion of a long and unparalleled career, the loss of which millions worldwide would almost certainly be mourning. Celebrated through the 50s as Hollywoods golden girl, her glamour and success were undercut by her addictions and personal demons, though if these had not led to her untimely death in 1962, one can only assume that she wouldve overcome them and been happy and productive in her ensuing five decades, leaving behind a legacy of triumph instead of tragedy. Monroe earned her place alongside baseball and apple pie as a true emblem of Americana, and if her loss hadnt already been grieved half a century ago, theres no doubt that Americans would be grieving today, the day of her death. Rest in peace, Marilyn. Heaven has a new star. "

Make no mistake: I will not sit idly by when stuff happens if theres stuff we can do about that stuff, Bush told supporters in Iowa. In a Bush Administration there will be a zero-tolerance policy on stuff. Pressed for specifics, Bush said that, in addition to preventing stuff from happening, he would also work tirelessly to stop junk. If I see junk happening that will harm the American people, I will not put up with that junk, he said, adding for emphasis, or stuff. Citing an example, he said that as President he would demand that Russian President Putin stop the junk he is doing in Syria. I would be like, If you think you can do that kind of junk and were just going to lay back and not do stuff about it, you are sorely mistaken about that stuff, he said. Striking a resolute tone at the conclusion of his speech, Bush told his supporters: Read my lips: no junk stuff. "

A police force, a fire department, a hospitalall the usual stuff, with the exception of one thing: Every single person who lives in this place is a Ronald McDonald impersonator. Sounds crazy, right? Wrong. Welcome to some place in Japan where thats probably the deal. Yup. Its most likely called Piero Toshi, or, as theres a good chance its colloquially referred to, Ronald Village. An entire city of men, women, and children, all going about their daily lives in the likeness of the famous fast-food clown Ronald McDonald. To you, it might sound like something out of an episode of The Twilight Zone. But to the people of some city in Japan where this is presumably the whole shtick, its all theyve ever known. Wow. What a fascinating community that probably exists somewhere in Japan, like maybe up in the hills somewhere? Sure seems within the realm of possibility. To an outsider, mornings in the city are a surreal scene, with the town square most likely abustle with dozens of people cheerfully galumphing to work in those signature yellow overalls and bright red shoes. Chances are a young Ronald McDonald can be seen helping an older Ronald McDonald across the street. And you gotta think that three child Ronald McDonalds are waiting for the bus to pick them up and take them to school. This is the strange and peculiar reality of somewhere, if not in Japan, then maybe in Norway? No, Japan seems more likely. Lets go with Japan. By all accounts, these Ronald McDonalds are normal folks, aside from the fact that theyve sequestered themselves and devoted their lives to impersonating the most famous fast-food mascot of all time. At least, that seems like a thing you could hear about existing in Japan, and you wouldnt really question it because it seems believable. After all, theyve already got that robot restaurant, so why not this? This definitely feels like some shit Japan would for sure have going on somewhere. So the next time youre in Japan, make sure to pay a visit to this unique city of Ronald McDonald impersonators that almost certainly is a thing. What an amazing world we live in! "
0,"A largely forgotten man sought attention on Wednesday night before returning to obscurity on Thursday, according to reports. The man, whom many Americans had difficulty placing, was making a desperate bid to remind people of his existence, experts believe. His efforts were somewhat successful, as his widely reported outburst caused people across the country to rack their brains to try to remember who he was. After briefly attempting to recall where they had seen the man before, many people gave up and moved on with their days, but for others, the desperate mans remarks left a bitter aftertaste. There is no excuse for making comments like those, no matter who you are, Tracy Klugian, forty-seven, of Springfield, Missouri, said. Who is he again? Still others showed concern for the man, and expressed hope that, instead of future bids for attention, he would find fulfillment in crafting or some other harmless hobby. "

Obviously, we have instructed our moderators to goad the Democrats into attacking each other as personally as possible, Zucker told reporters at CNN headquarters. But if ten, fifteen, twenty minutes go by, and theyre just talking about the issues and so forth, were going to Trump. At the time the debate is slated to start, the billionaire is scheduled to eat dinner with his wife at a Manhattan restaurant, where CNN has already set up a camera crew and sound truck, for when we decide to pull the rip-cord, Zucker said. As news professionals, we have an obligation to show our audience what they want to see, Zucker said. So the Democrats should be aware that, as far as tonight goes, they are on a very short leash. Zucker confirmed that if CNN winds up cutting away to Trump for the remainder of the night the network will make a four-minute highlight reel of the Democratic debate available as a Web-only feature.

0,"Dear American, For the past few weeks Ive been under constant attack. My opponents would have you believe that if Im elected, youll be stripped of your Social Security benefits and will be scrounging for food in dumpsters with all the desperation of a feral cat. Of course, thats true. But what they dont tell you is what Id replace Social Security with: an amazing new program I like to call Perrycare. Under Perrycare, youll receive all the food, clothing and shelter you need, and it wont cost a dime in taxes. How is that possible? Simple: youll be praying for all those things. As a Perrycare recipient, each week youll receive in your e-mail box a Perrycare PrayerMail, giving you an easy-to-recite prayer for the bread, milk, cat food, or whatever else you need to survive. Its like a Groupon from God. Perrycare is more than a replacement for that infernal Ponzi scheme that has bamboozled Americans with regular monthly checks for seventy-five years. It is part of my larger plan to return prayer to its rightful place in American life. I get down on my knees every night and I promise you, if I am elected your President, I will bring this entire country to its knees. I expect that some of my opponents will laugh at my plan, especially that lawn gnome Ron Paul and Michele (Crazy Eyes) Bachmann. Fine, let them laugh! Laughter is the best medicine. And if I am elected, there will be no other medicine. That brings me to my Perrycare medical plan, which will replace Medicare once I consign that Ponzi scheme to the electric chair of history. I dont have enough time to go into the whole plan right now, but here it is in two words: single prayer. Your next President, Governor Rick Perry "
0,"Saying that things just didnt work out, the billionaire Koch brothers have decided to put Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker up for sale. The Kochs, who earlier had purchased Gov. Walker with great fanfare, announced their plan to sell the politician in a terse statement from Koch Industries headquarters in Wichita. Scott Walker is a fine individual, and we wish him well, the Kochs statement read. We are confident that he will be a good fit for some other billionaire industrialists. Republican insiders, however, called the Kochs plan to sell Walker highly optimistic, and noted that the market for the Wisconsin Governor was, at this point, virtually nonexistent. The Kochs, who reportedly had been frustrated by Walkers poor performance in the polls, finally decided to sell the Wisconsinite after last weekends odd pronouncement, in which he seemed to support a border wall with Canada. According to a Koch associate, Ignorance has always been a part of Scotts appeal, but that Canada thing was just too much. After their plan to sell him was announced, the Kochs immediately pulled Walker off the campaign trail for fear that he might say something that would further reduce his dwindling market value. In Iowa, an aide to Walker said that the Governor was still processing the news that he had been put up for sale. It takes a while for Scott to understand things, the aide said.

Richard III is more than an important historical figure to me. Hes a role model. Mr. Murdoch said that he plans to put Richard III on display at the News Corporation headquarters in New York, where he will serve as an inspiration to all our employees when Im not there. But Mr. Murdochs shocking purchase of Richards bones has ignited howls of protest from British historians like Alistair Grindle, who warns that the media magnates motives may be far from pure. It would not surprise me one bit if Murdoch attempted to reanimate Richard IIIs DNA and use him to seize control of the British government, says Mr. Grindle. The last thing this world needs is Rupert Murdoch and Richard III working together. For his part, Mr. Murdoch said he was baffled why his purchase of Richard III had proven so controversial: This is far from the first time Ive bought a British leader.

0,"A U.S. intelligence agency was so busy spying on three hundred million Americans that it failed to notice one dude who was working for it, a spokesman for the agency acknowledged today. I guess we were so busy monitoring the everyday communications of every man, woman, and child in the nation that we didnt notice that a contractor working for us was downloading tons of classified documents, the agency spokesman said. Its definitely embarrassing, for sure. Despite having an annual budget in the neighborhood of ten billion dollars, the agency had no idea that a dude who was working for it five days a week was getting ready to send those classified documents to a journalist who would then tell everybody in the world. Maybe if we hadnt been so busy keeping our eye on those other three hundred million people, we would have noticed that this one guy who was working right under our noses was up to something totally fishy, the spokesman said. But you know what they say about hindsight. As for where that guy who leaked the documents was planning to go next, the spokesman admitted, We dont have a clue. I know what youre thinkingan intelligence agency probably should know that Hong Kong has an international airport and that its departures board lists flights to Moscow and whatnot, the spokesman said. I dont know what to say. Maybe we need a bigger budget or something. "
0,"President Obama has imperiled his second term by lying to the American people, one of the nations foremost lying experts said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press. The accusation carried weight, observers said, coming as it did from a legendary figure in the high-stakes world of competitive lying. He was harshly critical of Mr. Obamas fibbing, calling it amateurish at best, contrasting the Presidents lack of lying experience with his own half-century of dishonesty. The American people deserve a President who is a world-class liar, he said. Sadly, they do not have that President. Speaking from experience, he said that he had learned the hard way just how difficult lying can be: Just when you think youve gotten away with it, theres someone with a hidden camera catching you telling the truth. He said that it was possible that the President might grow as a liar in the remaining three years of his term, but he was not optimistic. Lying isnt something you can just pick up on the job, he said. Maybe President Obama would be better off leaving it to us professionals. "
0,"In a blockbuster documentary to be broadcast tonight, the Fox News Channel alleges that Obamacare is little more than a thinly veiled scheme to force Americans to live longer. The documentary, called The Ugly Truth About Obamacare, claims that President Obama is cynically using the health-care law to achieve his true objective: raising the life expectancy of Americans without their consent. In America, how long you live has always been your own business, says the documentarys narrator, Sean Hannity. Under Obamacare, though, its the governments businessa government that wants you to live as long as humanly possible. The documentary lays out a nightmare scenario of Americans being saddled with sky-high life expectancies for years to come. In perhaps the most chilling prediction of the documentary, Mr. Hannity warns, If Obamacare goes into effect, Americans will be forced to live as long as people in Finland, Denmark, and other socialist countries. Speaking with reporters today, Mr. Hannity said he hoped that the documentary would be a wake-up call about the secret agenda behind Obamacare. President Obama is playing God with American lives, Mr. Hannity said. And if he stubbornly insists on making those lives longer, that could be grounds for impeachment. "
0,"President Barack Obama received a stern lecture on foreign policy today from a man who almost started a war with Great Britain in July. When it comes to dealing with foreign countries, President Obama doesnt have a clue, said Mitt Romney, who during a summer visit to London caused the biggest international incident between the United States and Great Britain since the War of 1812. Only I have what it takes to bring peace to the Middle East. Mr. Romneys statement about his foreign-policy prowess drew an official response from British Prime Minister David Cameron, who in a tersely worded statement, said, Hah, good one. But the G.O.P. nominee pressed on with this theme during several campaign stops today, saying that his trial by fire at the London Olympics had prepared him for foreign-policy challenges ahead. Dealing with something as straightforward as the Middle East will be like a day at the beach compared to a volatile tinderbox like England, he said. Mr. Romney also laid out his plans for bringing a lasting peace to the Middle East: Right now, the region is chaos. Entire countries are in uproar, and they are focussing their anger on America. The only way for us to fix that is by attacking Iran. In other political news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a four-year high, making President Obama the crappiest socialist in history. "

The hundred-million number, while robust, falls short of the hundred and twenty million Mothers Day messages collected by the N.S.A. in May.

He added, On the whole, mothers take Mothers Day more seriouslyif the e-mails we read by mothers whose children forgot are any indication. General Alexander said that the agency collected in the neighborhood of two to three million such e-mails from angry mothers this year.

0,"Get ready for a scientific breakthrough that will blow your mind. It may have seemed like a pipe dream a few years ago, but a team of molecular biologists from the University of Chicago announced this week that theyve finally done the impossible: Theyve successfully created a gorilla without arms or legs. We have long hypothesized that creating a gorilla without limbs was theoretically possible, but isolating the correct genetic markers had proved quite elusive, said Ben OShaughnessy, lead researcher on the six-year, $40 million project. For a number of years, it seemed like this was something wed never see in our lifetime, but now we know we can genetically engineer a gorilla to have no limbs. Named Randi, the 3-year-old, 175-pound western lowland gorilla was created by scientists targeting the signaling center that controls the tissue outgrowth for the arms and legs. While the creatures survival was tenuous for the first years of its life, the research team finally felt Randi was ready for public viewing on Monday. It was a long process of trial and error for us, OShaughnessy said. For years, we saw a number of failed attempts: a gorilla with just one arm, a gorilla with three legs, a gorilla without a head, and, of course, several limbless gorillas that died within the first three months. Randi is a miracle of modern science, OShaughnessy added. Truly, a beautiful amalgam of science and nature. Science FTW! Although researchers still have some work to do, the medical community is already abuzz with the implications of this huge milestone. We cant wait to see how they use this research to create new treatments that will save lives. One thing is clear: The field of medicine will never be the same. "

0," After a challenging week for the legislative body, the approval rating of the United States Congress has shrunk to a point where it is no longer detectable by the technology currently available, a leading pollster said on Friday. Davis Logsdon, who heads the highly regarded Opinion Research Institute at the University of Minnesota, said that his polling unit has developed highly sensitive measurement technology in recent years to gauge Congresss popularity as it fell into the single digits, but added that as of this week, Congress is basically flatlining. At the beginning of the week, you could still see a slight flicker of approval for Congress, he said. Thenbam!the lights went out. Logsdon said, however, that people should resist drawing the conclusion that Congresss approval rating now stands at zero. They may have support in the range of .0001 per cent or, say, .0000001 per cent, he said. Our equipment just isnt advanced enough to measure it. Logsdon said that the swift descent of Congresss approval rating below detectable levels has surprised experts in the polling profession. A couple of years ago, when they shut down the government, I wondered, What could they possibly do to become less popular than this? the pollster said. Now we know. "

A picture of ISIS Lamb Chopwhich is based on the late ventriloquist Shari Lewis beloved puppet but features a disturbingly lifelike and fleshy human assbegan circulating online this morning in what can only be described as a horrific and senseless attack on all of humanity. The militant Islamist group quickly took credit for the puppet in a statement posted on social media. Many details regarding ISIS Lamb Chop puppet are still unknown, but the altered Lamb Chop appears to be an exact replica of the one used by Shari Lewis on her 1990s PBS show, Lamb Chops Play-Along, with the lone exception of its shockingly realistic human ass. It has yet to be determined how members of the Islamic State were able to achieve such verisimilitude with their addition to the Lamb Chop puppet, but officials have confirmed that it is an extremely realistic-looking ass. News of the Lamb Chop puppets impeccably rendered human ass sent shockwaves throughout the world, with millions taking to social media to express grief and outrage regarding ISIS giving the cherished puppet such a realistic ass that looks like it belongs to a human and not a lamb. Others urged users not to share the picture of ISIS Lamb Chop puppet due to its disturbing and graphic nature. Today was another chilling reminder that ISIS willingness to inflict pain and suffering on innocent people around the world knows no bounds. Lets just hope our security forces are better able to prevent them from carrying out attacks like this in the future. "

Harland Dorrinson, who heads the largest association of random shooters in the nation, said that Trumps Fifth Avenue plan lacked many of the key ingredients necessary for a credible random shooting. Theres no weapons cache, no twisted manifesto to be found later by authorities, Dorrinson said. To anyone in the random-shooting world, Trumps plan fails on so many levels. Moreover, he said, Trump has not put in the many years of solitary seething that most random shooters deem mandatory. Before you do a random shooting, youre supposed to be quiet and keep to yourself, he said. Trump is always shouting at thousands of people. Dorrinson added that although many random shooters have been in the Trump camp thus far, the candidates vague random-shooting plan is now giving them pause. Donald Trump made it sound like a random shooting is just the easiest thing in the world, he said. At the end of the day, random shooters find that hurtful.

Expanding on this theme, the President said, America is made up of all kinds of people: young and old, weak and strong, smart and dumb. And when the really dumb ones get up and act like total clowns, I still love them, because they are part of America. In fact, a really big part. In a call for unity, the President concluded, Lets all work together for the United States of America. And if that means putting aside our differencesincluding our sometimes vast differences in intelligenceso be it. "
0,"In a development that offers a faint glimmer of hope for Iraq, both Sunnis and Shiites are finding common ground in the view that former Vice-President Dick Cheney seriously needs to shut up. In the days following the publication, this week, of a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece about Iraq that Cheney wrote with his daughter Liz, hatred of the former Vice-President has, to the surprise of many, become the first thing that Sunnis and Shiites have agreed upon in centuries. Iraqi observers in recent days have reported seeing both Sunnis and Shiites reading the Cheneys op-ed then tearing it to shreds in a rage. Cheney is an ass! a Sunni merchant reportedly exclaimed in a Baghdad market on Thursday, to the resounding cheers of several Shiites nearby. Historically, its been challenging to find anything that Sunnis and Shiites agree on, said Sabah al-Alousi, a history professor at the University of Baghdad. Thats why their apparent consensus that Dick Cheney needs to shut the hell up is so significant. Visiting Baghdad on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the joint Sunni-Shiite calls for Dick Cheney to shut his pie hole were a cause for optimism. If Dick Cheney winds up being the one thing that brings Sunnis and Shiites together, the United States owes him a debt of thanks, he said, adding that the two sects view of the former Vice-President was also shared by the Kurds.

0,"Adding his voice to the eleventh-hour debate about the government shutdown, Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) today proposed reopening just enough of the government to hold new hearings on Benghazi. Across this great nation of ours, people are suffering, he told Fox Newss Megyn Kelly. Suffering, Megyn, because they still dont know what really happened in Benghazi. Noting that the government shutdown had furloughed investigators who could be looking into Benghazi, he said, If theres something in our government more worthy of funding than that, I cant think of it. Senator Paul said he knew that he would draw the ire of fellow Republicans by suggesting that the government be partially reopened, but added, Sometimes, you have to put politics aside when there is something more important at stake, and I think any reasonable person would agree that there is nothing more important than getting to the bottom of Benghazi. For the two weeks of this shutdown, the American people have had no new information about Benghazi, he said. Its time to stop the madness. "
0,"One day after he was roundly criticized by both parties for his comments about Libya, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney attempted to burnish his foreign-policy credentials today, telling reporters that no one has spent more time overseas than my money has. My money has served in banks from Switzerland to Bermuda, and from Bermuda to the Cayman Islands, Mr. Romney said. I challenge my opponents money to equal that record of service. Doubling down on his latest theme, Mr. Romney promised that on Day One of my Presidency, I will ensure that American money is safe and secure in secret vaults and underground caves around the world. Mr. Romneys recent foray into foreign policy may have hurt him in a new poll, in which a majority of likely voters agreed with the statement, Mitt Romney is starting to make his trip to the London Olympics look like the pinnacle of modern diplomacy. An official statement from the Romney campaign did not refer to his latest comments, but indicated that between now and the election Mr. Romneys schedule would demphasize events where he might be called upon to open his mouth.

0,"The 2016 Republican presidential primary race has not been going as expected for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, from plummeting poll numbers, to a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, to several lackluster debate performances. And with the New Hampshire primary in full swing, the latest news out of the Bush camp adds to that list of woes: Jeb Bushs campaign bus broke down on a train track, and a train is rapidly approaching. Not good, Jeb! Six months ago, if you had predicted that Jeb Bush would be in fifth place nationally and sitting helplessly on train tracks in his campaign bus, turning the ignition over and over while yelling Come on! Come on! as a freight train barreled down on him, most pundits would have said you were crazy. But the former presumptive frontrunner is indeed in dire straits today, as even his repeated honking of the buss horn hasnt slowed the approach of the train. To make matters worse, Jebs competitors continue to shine. Ted Cruz earned a victory in the Iowa caucuses, while Donald Trump is leading polls in New Hampshire and is not currently stuck on train tracks with a 120-car freight train just 30 seconds away from smashing his bus into complete oblivion. In a campaign dominated by political outsiders and an upending of conventional thinking, Jeb Bushs $150 million in fundraising has done little to sway public opinion or get his stalled bus out of the way of 180,000 pounds of crushing force created by a AC4400CW locomotive. Hardly presidential! Can Jeb recover from this latest setback in time for tonights polls? Back in August, it seemed easy to imagine Jeb putting the bus in neutral, then gathering his whole campaign staff to try to push it across the tracks seconds before the train would have sent them all to kingdom come. But today, such a recovery is hard to envision for the struggling campaign. If he cant rebound from this train-track debacle, Bushs White House bid may end even before Super Tuesday. Only time will tell! "
0,"Humanity has been trying to binge-watch effectively for thousands of years, but due to uncomfortable seating, lackluster viewing options, and poor snack choice accompaniments, had been unable tountil recently. 1. Anthropologists believe that members of the close human relative Homo habilis were attempting a Pleistocene-period version of binge-watching when they improvised an early form of television by trapping a weasel inside a hollow tree stump and watching through a small eyehole until it turned into a skeleton. 2. To take their minds off the 1066 Norman conquest of England, the Anglo-Saxons invented the tuba, put it on a stool and all gathered round to sit in chairs and look at it for hours. 3. In 1590, Shakespeare fans were despondent after learning there was only one play out by him, Two Gentlemen Of Verona, and, insatiable for Shakespeare, they forced actors to perform the play 4,872 times in a row without stopping until he wrote a new one. 4. Back in 1812, binge-watching was actually considered one of the most dangerous options for a date night, as hundreds died after calling their girlfriends over to their canoe and paddling out into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to spend all night watching naval battles between the United States and British forces. 5. Throughout the 1920s, Prohibition laws led to a rampant increase in binge-watching, which at that point consisted of going into a public square with a partner, putting your mouth near their eyes, and loudly telling entertaining stories. 6. In 2014, binge-watching was done standing behind your television for some reason. "

In a brief appearance before the press, Speaker Boehner talked about his gradual realization that filing a lawsuit requires effort and, yes, work. I came to the conclusion that while suing the President would be the best thing for the American people, it would also require that I do something, he said, struggling to retain his composure. And that would be a betrayal of everything I stand for. Mr. Boehners decision drew praise from fellow Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), who called it courageous. I know this was a very difficult decision for John, McConnell said. But at the end of the day you have to be true to your core values. "

It really will work better for us, Obama said in a press conference Tuesday morning. In addition to the doorman, theres a guy at the front desk, and, if anyone comes to see you, the desk guy will call up to your apartment first to make sure its O.K. The senior doorman at the Obamas new building, Alex Kornash, seemed unfazed about providing security for the President. Ive been a doorman for twenty-three years, Kornash said. Someone doesnt belong here, you tell them to go away. Whats so hard about that? The 2,140-square-foot, three-bedroom condominium that the Obamas will call home includes many amenities, including central air-conditioning, a washer/dryer and all new stainless-steel appliances, according to its real-estate listing. In addition, when the President makes one of his frequent trips, theres someone to take in the mail and water the plants, he said. Since the Presidents announcement of his move, there has already been considerable interest in the White House, mainly from foreign buyers, sources said. "
0,"By easing tensions with Cuba and now Iran, President Obama is recklessly squandering Americas precious supply of enemies, the leader of a conservative think tank said on Tuesday. Our adversarial relationships with Cuba and Iran took years of frostiness and saber-rattling to maintain, Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the Washington-based Institute for Infinite Conflict, said. Thanks to the President, decades of well-crafted hostility have been thrown out the window. According to Dorrinson, fears abound in conservative circles that the President might be capriciously casting about for other powder kegs to defuse during his remaining time in office. If his shameful record is any guide, hell probably try to disarm North Korea, Dorrinson said. Thats the doomsday scenario. Regardless of his future actions, Obamas detente with Cuba and Iran will likely tarnish his legacy forever, Dorrinson said. On this Presidents watch, America lost two of its most enduring foes, he said. Hes going to have to live with that for the rest of his life. Watch: Life as an aspiring standup comedian. "
0,"Reverend Pat Robertsons controversial remarks in which he advised that it was acceptable to divorce a spouse with Alzheimers drew a harsh rebuke from God Almighty, who held a press conference today to tell him to shut the fuck up. The bearded King of the Universe, dressed in His trademark flowing white robe and carrying a lightning bolt, spoke to reporters at New Yorks Hyatt Grand Central for forty-five minutes in a press conference specifically called to denounce the televangelist. Ive held my tongue while hes jabbered on and on about me punishing this group and that group with floods and earthquakes and such, but this was the last straw, He said. Enough already with that moron. In addition to debunking Reverend Robertsons Alzheimers statement, the Almighty categorically denied using natural disasters in the past to punish gays, Haitians, and other targets of Reverend Robertsons scorn. Oh, please, He said. Thats just weather. On another topic, God attempted to put distance between Himself and the Presidential candidacy of Governor Rick Perry of Texas: Rick Perry is qualified to be President in the same way that Olive Garden is qualified to be Italy.

0,"In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of the United States declared on Tuesday that lying by politicians is protected by the First Amendment because it is an expression of their religion. By a 54 majority, the Court struck down an Ohio law that would make it harder to lie in political ads, arguing instead that any attempt to restrict or punish lying by politicians is an unconstitutional infringement on a religion they have practiced for decades. The Courts decision won praise from politicians of both parties, with many saying that the Justices recognition of lying as a religion was long overdue. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts argued, For politicians, lying is a religious observance akin to attending a church or a synagogue, except that they do it seven days a week. "

Delighted customers mobbed the restaurants to try the zesty new sauce, with many chicken fanciers ordering their sandwiches with extra hate. Its so spicy it makes your mouth feel like its on firelike a gay couple in hell, said Harland Dorrinson, who sampled the sauce at a Chick-fil-A in Orlando. But even as Chick-fil-A prepared to call its new hate sauce an instant hit, it faced a challenge from an upstart rival, Wing-n-nuts. The rival chain, based in Falls Church, Virginia, chose today to introduce a new product targeting Chick-fil-A patrons, the Chicken Bacon Bigotwich. We think were going to take a big bite out of Chick-fil-As customer base, said Wing-n-nuts corporate spokesperson Carol Foyler. Their founder is anti-gay. But ours is anti-gay, anti-immigrant, and anti-woman. When word gets out about that, therell be lines around the block. "

0,"As controversy swirled around the Department of Justices move to obtain journalists phone records, the White House picked up a vote of support today from an unexpected source, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un of North Korea. I honestly dont see what the fuss is all about, Mr. Kim said in an official statement today. Of course its the governments right to know what people are doing at all timesand journalists would be right at the top of the list. Mr. Kim also offered a vigorous defense of the I.R.S. policy of auditing the tax returns of organizations that oppose the government: Again, this is something I wouldnt lose a wink of sleep over, and I know Dad felt the same way. In what was an otherwise laudatory statement about the activities of the U.S. government, Mr. Kim offered one small critique: They could save themselves the work of conducting audits and obtaining phone records if they would just get rid of journalists and anti-government groups in the first place. But, you know, baby steps. All in all, news of the I.R.S. audits and phone-records scandals have given the mercurial dictator hope that North Korea and the United States might have warmer relations in the future: We have a lot more in common than I thought.

After it became clear to park rangers yesterday that the famous lion might not live through the night, Cecil was treated to a big steak dinner before taking one last roam around the savanna at his home, Zimbabwes Hwange National Park. Park rangers say that Cecil then went to sleep for the final time, and at 11:55 p.m. last night, he was pronounced dead. Its already become very clear just how much Cecil meant to people. Fans have flocked to the park by the thousands to pay their final respects, and impromptu memorials for the beautiful big cat have been sprouting up all around the globe. The hashtag #RIPCecilTheLion is currently trending worldwide on Twitter, and tweets of grief from Cecils countless celebrity fans have been rolling in all morning: Were right there with you, Jimmy. While this is incredibly tragic, its comforting to know that Cecil the Lion died in peace. He may no longer be the king of the jungle, but wherever he is now, he surely just became royalty.

0,"Heres some news from the scientific world guaranteed to make waves. After a decade of dead ends and false starts, a team of geneticists at Stanford University announced this morning that they finally discovered a reliable way to make coyotes wider, smaller, heavier, more slippery, and quieter. Wow. Science FTW! When you can manipulate how genes are expressed, you can do incredible things, and these coyotes are proof, said Dr. Alanna Shah, whose 2002 research proposal kicked off this monumental undertaking. Every one of them is not only significantly heavier than the average coyote, but far more slippery, wider, smaller, quieter, rounder, and pointier too. Working with modified eggs, fertilized in vitro and gestated in a host mother, Dr. Shah and her team were able to breed a healthy litter of the modified coyotes, six in total. Shahs team will be tracking the growth and behavior of the coyotes closely to ensure that they continue to widen, grow more heavy and slippery, and stay small, glossy, bitter, orange, and soft into full adulthood, but so far, all signs point to success. But even with this incredible breakthrough under her belt, Dr. Shah is already looking ahead. This isnt where our work stops; this is where our work starts, she said. Its no longer so far-fetched that we could one day see coyotes that are flatter, stockier, saltier, rustier, hotter to the touch, bolder, and more Rubenesque. And thats just for starters. Simply awesome. It just goes to show that when technology, ingenuity, and inspiration come together, truly incredible things can happen. What do you think? Are you excited to find out what comes next? And how cool would it be to see one of these coyotes in your own backyard? Tweet/Facebook us to let us know! "

Randy is just a normal high school biology teacher, except, oh yeah, he just so happens to smell exactly like legendary singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. Yep, you read that right. Randys odor is a dead ringer for Leonard Cohens scent, so much so that whenever people smell him, they start looking around frantically for Leonard Cohen, because the smells are practically identical! Crazy! This is probably the freakiest story youre going to read all day. So, the next time you think you smell Leonard Cohen, make sure you double-check just who it is thats making the smell before you start bragging about it on social media.

Hoping to give the child a peaceful and fulfilling goodbye, hospital administrators bent over backwards to honor his last wish. The result is heartwarming: Will decided to use his last few breaths to inflate Gerard Butlers twin-sized air mattress! Beautiful. Medical professionals were on hand as Will was moved into a special wing of the hospital to complete his last request. No one present could keep it together as Wills parents held his tiny hand while he struggled to blow up the 300 stars Coleman air mattress. In a touching final gesture, they helped their son close the opening valve just before he passed. What an incredible act from an incredible young man. Will didnt want to go to Disney World, said his father, Mark. He didnt even want to meet Gerard Butler. He just wanted to blow up his favorite actors air mattress. He was always thinking of other people. Well miss you, Will. Butler acknowledged the poignant moment in a tweet yesterday: Wow. Wills is such an uplifting story. Now, whenever Gerard Butler goes camping or needs to put up a houseguest for a few nights, Will Robertsons memory will live on. He may have been taken from us far too soon, but no one can deny that he made an impact. "

0,"The Supreme Courts decision to preserve Obamacare subsidies has drawn sharp rebukes from Republican Presidential hopefuls, who warn that the victory for health care might eventually pave the way for similar advances in education and the environment. The Supreme Court has decided, apparently, that every American should have access to quality health care, said Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas). What if it decided to say the same thing about education? I dont mean to be an alarmist but, after today, I believe that anything is possible. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) also blasted the Court, telling reporters that a government that protects health care is one small, dangerous step away from protecting the environment. The nightmare that I have long feared is now suddenly upon us, Paul said. Mark my words, we are on a slippery slope toward clean air and water. On the campaign trail in Iowa, the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee raised another doomsday scenario, telling his audience, If the Court thinks people should be allowed to see a doctor when they want, they probably also think that people should be able to marry anyone they want. My friends, that is not what God intended when He created America. Speaking from New York, candidate Donald Trump offered his own scathing critique of the Supreme Court. You look at them in their robes, and you say, Those robes look freaking cheap, he said. When Im President, were getting more expensive robes. "

Hundreds of congressmen complained of headaches, dizzy spells, and extreme fatigue after putting in what sources called a six, maybe seven-hour day. With the nation headed over the fiscal cliff, there was no indication when Congress might reconvene, since many of its members had to be hospitalized after what was described as their near-total physical meltdown. According to Dr. Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota Medical School, Being forced to listen, compromise, and act like adults for minutes at a time was more punishing than these people could bear. Dr. Logsdon said that the gruelling ordeal of doing their jobs would likely keep members of Congress in the hospital for weeks. I dont see these people getting back to work until February at the earliest, he said. And thats great news for this country. Happy New Year, America. "

I couldnt agree more, said Mr. Putin, looking as though he had just smelled something bad. My hatred of this man knows no bounds. According to the agreement, economic coperation, cyber security, human rights, the war in Syria, and the New England Patriots owner Robert Krafts missing Super Bowl ring are among thirty-seven different topics that the two men will never again discuss. Additionally, at all future summits, if either Mr. Obama or Mr. Putin enters a room the other man will be obligated to leave immediately. The two men reached agreement on an unprecedented number of points, including never contacting each other via telephone or e-mail and keeping a minimum of five hundred feet away from each others residences.

At a presentation for Facebook employees at the companys headquarters in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg announced plans to build a $24 billion Facebook laser shield, a global network of satellites capable of identifying and incinerating Google drones in midair. Zuckerberg delighted his audience with a brief animated demonstration showing a Facebook satellite locking in on a Google drone and obliterating it with a green laser. Unfriended, bitch, said Zuckerberg, to a roaring ovation from his employees. Within an hour, Google responded with a stern warning of is own, vowing, Any act of aggression against Google drones will not stand. To that end, the company announced that it was prepared to shoot down Facebooks laser satellites with a long-range super cannon called Google Gun. "
0,"In what some critics are calling the most radical tactic ever employed in a State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama risked alienating congressional Republicans last night by repeatedly using facts. Mr. Obama stirred controversy throughout the speech with his relentless references to facts, data, and things that have actually happened, all long considered the third rail of American politics. As the President made reference to tax rates and unemployment numbers, as well as sixteen separate mentions of Osama bin Laden, congressional Republicans blood began to boil. After the speech, a furious Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, Its been a longstanding tradition in our politics not to use facts in a State of the Union address, a tradition the President chose to ignore in an outrageous way tonight. I wont stand for it, and the American people wont stand for it. We want to work with the President for the good of the American people, added House Speaker John Boehner. But hes going to have to take facts off the table. Thats a deal-breaker for us. The President did not mention any of his G.O.P. Presidential rivals by name in his speech, but at one point said that government should be leaner, a blatant jab at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "
0,"Whether or not you eat meat, one thing everyone can agree on is that when animals are slaughtered for food, it should be done in an ethical manner that minimizes suffering and preserves the creatures dignity. Thats why one Nebraska-based farming company is introducing a humane new approach to slaughtering animals that could change the industry forever: letting the cows get in a few shots before they kill them. Yup. Fairview Farms Inc., an Omaha slaughterhouse that raises and processes hundreds of cattle a year, is earning the praise of animal rights organizations and the meat industry alike for its unique new approach to ethical killing. Shortly before a cow is slaughtered, the animal is brought into a small outdoor pen where a Fairview employee in a padded protective bodysuit is waiting. There, the animal is permitted to kick or headbutt the employee as much as it pleases during a two-minute window. If the cow doesnt immediately seem interested in doling out punishment to its human handler, its encouraged to do so through a couple whacks to the ribs with a Wiffle ball bat, or, if that fails, a firm pinch on the tail with a pair of pliers. After the cow has knocked around its handler for a while, the employee lies down on the ground in faux defeat, and enthusiastic mooing sounds play over a loudspeaker to give the animal the illusion that its being cheered on by its bovine peers. Then, the cowstill blissful from having battered a humanis led into a metal squeeze chute where a heavy steel bolt is driven into its brain with a powerful blast of compressed air, killing the animal instantly and painlessly. It slows down our facilitys output a bit, but we just want to make sure the cows get to have a little fun before they die, says Fairview Farms CEO Ben Jacobson about the humane new slaughtering practice. When theyre kicking you around, theyre like little kids on Christmas. And we think thats the least we can do for them to make their final moments special. Wow! Even if you dont eat meat, youve got to admit that this is a pretty awesome and thoughtful way to show these animals respect before theyre slaughtered. Truly, theyre going out on a high note! "
0," Serving notice that he intends to go toe-to-toe with the controversial real-estate mogul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker used the official announcement of his Presidential candidacy to assure Republican voters that he is as horrible as Donald Trump. Donald Trump has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past few weeks by spewing bigotry and venom, Walker told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. I want to make it clear that when it comes to those things, I take a back seat to no one. Concluding his speech with a line that triggered a standing ovation, Walker said, To those who thought Donald Trump was the only sociopath in the race, let me say this: not anymore. Prior to his announcement, aides to the Wisconsin governor had privately fretted that by establishing his identity as an arrogant and ill-informed merchant of hatred, Trump had appropriated Walkers brand. In the hopes of proving that Trump has no monopoly on odiousness, aides have released a point-by-point comparison showing that on such key issues as workers rights and health care, Walker is just as terrifying as the former reality-show host. Acknowledging that Trump has dominated media attention for now, Walkers aides believe that the governor will eventually reclaim his rightful mantle as the worst person in the race. Sooner or later, the Trump candidacy is going to fall apart and voters are going to be looking for another dick to vote for, one aide said. Scott Walker wants to be that dick. "

Pretty amazing development for a twenty-something who at the time was still living at home and spending all day playing Angry Birds. But there I was, receiving the cheers of millions of North Koreans, who usually dont get that excited unless theyve caught sight of a pork sandwich. (LOL) Here is why I am writing to you today: on Tuesday, you will go to your caucuses and choose from among a field of Republican Presidential candidates. And let me tell you, the idea of any of these people getting nuclear weapons scares the shit out of me. This is just one of many differences between your country and mine. In North Korea, we lock up the criminally insane. In America, you let them debate on TV. Right now you have people running for President I would not trust to take care of my plants. So who do I recommend you vote for on Tuesday? In a word, me. If you think about it, I am the most Republican candidate of all. In North Korea, we have no taxes. We have achieved that through a conservative policy of no jobs. Also, we have no wasteful big government programs providing food, shelter, or safe drinking water. And am I pro-life? Well, try this on for size: I believe that life begins at conception and ends at starvation. Now, I know what youre thinking: Im too young to be President, since Im under thirty-five. Well, who would you rather have running your country, someone whos under thirty-five, or someone whose I.Q. is under thirty-five? (LOL) I think when you look at all the facts, voters of Iowa, youll realize that Kim Jong-un is the Republican who most deserves your vote. And if youre still not convinced, remember this: at least Im not Mitt Romney. Peace out yo, Your Supreme Leader "

0,"In what some experts are calling a strong indicator of improvement in the economy, Republicans in recent weeks have begun renewing their claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. While most economists agree that any significant improvement in the U.S. economy is generally accompanied by an uptick in G.O.P. questions about Mr. Obamas place of birth, there is now an econometric tool for measuring the increase in those claims: the so-called S. & P. Birther Index. The Birther Index, established in 2008, measures the occurrences of such words as birth certificate, Kenya, and wasnt born here in Republican statements about the President, and has proven to be a surprisingly reliable tool for tracking improvements in the economy. Harland Dorinson, the economist who devised the S. & P. Birther Index, said that as the economy recovers the index also shows a strong surge in statements questioning the Presidents Christianity. As unemployment started going down, we saw an increase in references to Mr. Obama being a Muslim, he said. This is generally a very bullish sign for the economy. But Mr. Dorinson was quick to add that while the surge in references to Mr. Obama being an Islamic socialist born in a mud hut in Nairobi is encouraging, the economy is not out of the woods yet. We wont be fully in a recovery until the Republicans start calling him a Wiccan, he said. And if they start saying hes a Satanist who practices human sacrifice and drinks the blood of children, then itll be time to pop open the champagne. "

This exciting new slogan is just one piece of our over-all rebranding strategy, Zucker said. Going forward, we want CNN to be synonymous with the threat of imminent death. He added that the network expected to see strong ratings growth as a result of having the words Holy Crap, Were All Gonna Die on-screen twenty-four hours a day. Part of Zuckers new strategy was on display during Tuesdays edition of the networks signature program, The Situation Room, in which a visibly ill-at-ease Wolf Blitzer appeared dressed as The Grim Reaper.

Today, I would like to offer every woman in Missouri my deepest apology. If your uterus could talk, Ill bet it would have some choice words about old Todd right about now. For the last forty-eight hours, Ive been getting an earful from a lot of you. Youve said that Im an ignorant, dangerous man. Youve said that I should be put away someplace where I can do as little harm as possible. To that I say, I couldnt agree more. And that place is the U.S. Senate. I know what some of you are thinking: if we send Todd to the Senate, wont he be able to do more damage than he did in the House? Well, think again. In the House, I was a member of the Science Committee. Scientific matters that impact the entire nation were entrusted to a man who thinks that lady parts have E.S.P. Electing me to the Senate will get me as far away from science as possible. But heres the most important reason to keep me in Washington. As long as I am in Congress, I will be on C-SPAN, where you can monitor me around the clock. If I look like I am about to go off, you can notify the authorities and have me quickly subdued. Its democracys version of the electronic ankle bracelet. On the other hand, if I lose, Ill come back to Missouri and be released into the general population. The choice is yours, Missouri.

0,"Taking a victory lap after their candidates win in the first Presidential debate Wednesday night, Romney campaign insiders today attributed his success to his strategic use of relentless lying. We worked for hours on this during the practice debates, said the campaign manager Matt Rhoades. We were, like, Mitt, if you find yourself on the verge of saying something true, bite your tongue. Mr. Rhoades said that the nominee was allowed to say his real name and acknowledge that he used to be a Governor, but other than that, he was on a very short leash, truth-wise. While Mr. Romneys talent for lying was in evidence during the Republican primary debates, it was nothing like the mad skills he displayed Wednesday night, the campaign manager said. All the hard work and practice lying really paid off, Mr. Rhoades said. Plus hanging out with Paul Ryan. "
0,"With just one week to go until the midterm elections, a new poll indicates that billionaires are likely to retain control of the United States government. The poll, conducted by the University of Minnesotas Opinion Research Institute, shows that the proxy candidates of billionaires are likely to win ninety-eight per cent of next Tuesdays races, with the remaining two per cent leaning billionaire. Although the poll indicates that some races are still too close to call, the fact that billionaires funded candidates on both sides puts the races safely in their column. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the poll for the University of Minnesota, said that next Tuesday should be a big night for oligarchs and that both houses of Congress can be expected to grovel at the feet of their money-gushing paymasters for at least the next two years. Calling the billionaires upcoming electoral romp historic, Logsdon said, We have not seen the super-rich maintain such a vise-like grip on the government since the days immediately preceding the French Revolution.

0,"Aides to President Obama said today that he was visibly shaken after receiving support from House Speaker John Boehner for his Syria campaign, adding that the Speakers vote of confidence was making him rethink the whole thing. An aide to Mr. Obama, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that he was in the Oval Office with the President when he got the call from Mr. Boehner: As it became clear that Boehner was going to support him on this, he looked more and more stunned. He was trying to stay calm and all but you could see that he was really taken aback. After putting down the phone with Mr. Boehner, the President reportedly told aides, Boehners supporting it. Thats so weird. This is still a good idea, right? Moments after the President had seemed to settle down, the aide said, he received a phone call from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who also offered his support for the Syria plan. That one really rattled him, the aide said. He was like, I think I need to take a long walk. The calls from Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor have created what the aide called the biggest crisis of confidence this President has ever experienced. I checked in on him later in the day, just to see if he was O.K., the aide said. He was cradling his head in his hands saying, I just dont know. I just dont know anymore. While the Presidents plan to attack Syria remains on the table, the aide indicated that the situation is very fluid: If Rand Paul calls today and says hes in, the whole thing goes away. "

Vesuvius erupting, you can bet I would have made a run for it. He said another option open to residents of Pompeii would have been to fight the volcano. Archeologists estimate that the population of Pompeii was about eleven thousand, he said. You cant tell me that if eleven thousand people put their minds to it they couldnt beat one volcano.

This is a huge step forward! While we can understand why our critics are upset with the lack of inclusion among this years Oscar nominees, we think these people simply dont understand that every single Oscar trophy is actually a statuette of an African-American man who slipped and fell into a cauldron of melted gold, said Academy spokesperson Allen Reed during a press conference this morning. Furthermore, the black man depicted in the Oscar statuette is not dead. This is a statuette of a proud, living black man who is completely encrusted in gold.

Any hope that the former Massachusetts governor would recover from such missteps was shattered after the Olympics Opening Ceremony, when he blasted former Beatle Paul McCartney for not being prepared to sing Hey Jude. He did not seem ready to sing that song, which was certainly disconcerting, Romney said. Maybe he should have gone with a song that he had done before. The Republican candidates visit did little to win over the British people, as a poll showed that a majority of Britons wanted the Opening Ceremony to conclude with the Olympic torch lighting Mr. Romneys head ablaze.

Breaking Bad, Running (Season 5, Episode 1) Via AMC When this previously acclaimed show opened its fifth season with Walt declaring that the only safe place to cook meth was the White House and that he and Jesse were running for president and vice president, longtime fans lost interest. 3. Home Improvement, The Other Wilson (Season 8, Episode 14) Via Disney/ABC The wise next-door neighbor Wilson was a fan favorite, so its understandable that when Home Improvement hit its eighth season, producers tried to add a second Wilson living on the other side of Tim Taylors house. Most critics agreed that this was too much of a good thing. 4. Alf, Alf Goes To Hell (Season 3, Episode 6) Via Warner Bros. Viewers immediately soured on the idea to send Alf to hell, but the stubborn show writers refused to allow Alf to leave hell until 39 episodes later. By then, it was too late for the show to recover in the eyes of fans. 5. Happy Days, Fonzie For The Defense (Season 5, Episode 27) Via ABC Fans and critics widely agree that the moment Happy Days jumped the shark was this tired season five episode where Fonzie has jury duty. 6. Heroes, God Is The Real Hero (Season 2, Episode 9) Via NBC For many viewers, the action-packed superhero series took a wrong turn in the season two episode God Is The Real Hero, in which the character of God was introduced as a superhero whose powers easily eclipsed those of the rest of the heroes and the shows faith-based message overwhelmed the story.

0,"Well, this was almost a real tragedy. Harrison Ford is currently in the hospital recovering from injuries he sustained while attempting to kiss an attractive woman that turned out to be a pile of live dynamite in a dress. According to reports from witnesses, the dynamite exploded right as the silver-screen legend was in the middle of giving it numerous loud, wet smooches. While details of the incident remain hazy, what we do know from health-care officials is that Harrison Ford was sitting alone at a table in a trendy L.A. cocktail bar Sunday night when he spotted what he thought was a beautiful woman wearing a sequined ball gown and a pearl necklace on the other side of the room. Eyewitnesses claim that Fords jaw fell all the way to the floor with an audible thud. His eyes then launched out of his head and draped themselves across his table like two long, limp sausages before recoiling back into their sockets like rubber bands. The Indiana Jones star then howled like a wolf and repeatedly slammed his face into the table as hard as he could before howling like a wolf once again. While he was howling like a wolf, the A-list actors head reportedly stretched out so that it looked like an actual wolfs face. Ford then levitated up out of his chair and floated across the room to the pile of dynamite in a dress with a dreamy expression on his face. He produced a bouquet of flowers from behind his back and attempted to present them to the pile of dynamite. Ford then began kissing the pile of dynamite over and over again. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when the fuse ran out and the dynamite detonated. According to emergency responders on the scene, the Star Wars actor suffered severe third-degree burns and was found repeatedly muttering the words What a woman! Despite his brush with death, Ford is reportedly attempting to stay positive while he heals. A tweet this morning from Fords son indicates that the Blade Runner star is looking on the bright side and committed to making a full recovery: Hope you feel better soon, Harrison! Were all pulling for you! "
0,"Minutes after the Russian mens hockey team fell to Finland 3-1, a devastated President Vladimir Putin told reporters, This must be what an actual election feels like. Reliving the horrible experience of watching his team lose to the Finns, the Russian leader said, As the game went on, I started thinking to myself, My God, I have no idea what the outcome of this is going to be. I had never experienced that feeling before. It was ghastly. Speaking of world leaders who have had to run in free and fair elections, Putin said, I admire their moxie. I really do. But after what I just went through today, I can definitely say its not for me. Photograph by Sasha Mordovets/Getty. "
0,"The novelist Philip Roth announced today that a sandwich he ate last week, a turkey one with lettuce and tomato on wheat, would be his last. Roths retirement from sandwich eating, announced in an interview with a Dutch literary magazine, came as a surprise to the worlds of publishing and sandwiches. In the interview, Roth attempted to soft-pedal the reasons behind his startling decision, saying only, I had my first sandwich when I was three or four. Thats almost eighty years ago. Thats a lot of sandwiches. The response to Mr. Roths renunciation of sandwiches was skeptical, with some readers of the interview questioning whether the acclaimed novelist had not left the door open a crack to sandwiches in his future. When asked by his Dutch interviewer if he had sworn off deli meats, Roth said, I could see a situation at a buffet where theyd have those mini slices of rye bread, and Id make an open-faced thingy with roast beef and maybe a pickle or whatnot. But thats not the same thing as a sandwich. As if to quell any misunderstanding, on Tuesday afternoon Roth issued the following statement through his publisher: Not only have I had my last sandwich, I have made my final public statement about sandwiches.

The new entity, FetaBook, is expected to raise much-needed billions in an upcoming I.P.O. The social network formerly known as Greece announced that it would cancel its upcoming elections and instead install a C.E.O., a twenty-four-year-old hacker from suburban Athens named Ciro Mavromatidis. Speaking from the newly opened offices of FetaBook, Mr. Mavromatidis explained how the social network would be attractive to the investment community in ways that Greece was not. Were keeping all the aspects of Greece that made it a cool brandthe ruins, the Olympics, the olives, he said. Were just losing the things that were a drag on the Greek economy: namely, the Greeks. He said under the new plan, all Greeks would cease to be citizens of Greece and would instead become friends of FetaBook: They wont receive any government benefits anymore, but theyll be able to grow all the imaginary food they want. Mr. Mavromatidis said that by converting from a nation to a social network, FetaBook will enjoy other cost savings as well. We Greeks waste billions of dollars a year smashing plates after meals, he said. Now thats going to be done by an app. "
0,"In a television appearance on Sunday, the leading Senate Republican warned President Obama in no uncertain terms against doing anything in his remaining three hundred and forty days in office. The President should be aware that, for all intents and purposes, his term in office is already over, Mitch McConnell said on Fox News. Its not the time to start doing things when you have a mere eight thousand one hundred and sixty hours left. While acknowledging that the President has eleven months remaining in the White House, McConnell said that he and the President have an honest disagreement about how long eleven months is. The President believes it is almost one year, he said. I believe it is almost zero years. Im not a mathematician, but I believe I am right. As for how Obama should spend his remaining time in office, McConnell said, If the President has trouble doing nothing, we will be more than happy to show him how it is done.

0,"Geneticists at the University of Minnesota believe that they have isolated the gene that makes some people much more prone to failure than others. While the research is preliminary, the scientists said that they were able to successfully identify the failure gene by studying the DNA of males in two generations of the same American family. If we have indeed isolated the gene that makes people failand we believe we haveall of the subjects in our study are carriers, said Davis Logsdon, the geneticist who supervised the research. According to Logsdon, those who carry the gene for failure have absolutely no idea that they have it and thus project the confidence and self-assurance of people whose genetic material does not make them likely to wreak havoc on a massive scale. Not only does this gene cause people to fail, it makes them fail to understand that they have failed, he said. It is a really bad gene. While scientists have not yet found a cure for the failure gene, they consider isolating it a major breakthrough in itself. Once we identify someone as a carrier of this gene, we can try to keep him out of situations where he might do great harm to others, Logsdon said.

0,"Canada, already bracing for the possible inflow of millions of American refugees in November, might have made matters worse by releasing an unacceptably adorable photo of its Prime Minister hugging two baby pandas, Canadians fear. The photo, taken at the Toronto Zoo and showing Justin Trudeau cuddling with two panda cubs, was the last thing this country needed, Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of Canadians for Responsible Immigration, a prominent anti-immigration organization based in Ottawa, said. Canada is already staring down the potential crisis of millions of Americans pouring over its border later this year, Dorrinson said. Did we really have to announce that we have pandas, too? The news photo, which Dorrinson called an unmitigated disaster, is expected to worsen the influx of illegal Americans because, he said, in addition to pointing out that Canada has pandas, it is also reminding people that our Prime Minister is an unusually handsome man, especially for someone in government. In an open letter published online, the anti-immigration leader urged Trudeau to put his country first and cancel a visit scheduled for Friday at the Winnipeg Puppy and Kitten Shelter.

0,"A new Oxfam report indicating that the wealthiest one per cent possesses about half of the worlds wealth has left the richest people in the world reeling with disappointment, a leading billionaire said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum, the hedge-fund owner Harland Dorrinson said, I think I speak for a lot of my fellow billionaires when I say I thought we were doing a good deal better than that. Calling the Oxfam findings sobering, he said that he hoped they would serve as a wake-up call to billionaires everywhere that its time to up our game. Quite frankly, a lot of us thought that by buying politicians, rewriting tax laws, and hiding money overseas, we were getting it done, said Dorrinson, who owns the hedge fund Garrote Capital. If, at the end of the day, all we control is a measly half of the worlds wealth, clearly we need to do moremuch more. In Davos, Dorrinson is huddling with other billionaires in the hopes of setting an ambitious goal for the top one per cent: to own the other half of the worlds wealth by 2025. While he considers this target doable, Dorrinson said that he does not underestimate the challenge of wresting the other half from the vise-like grip of the approximately seven billion people who comprise the bottom ninety-nine per cent. Getting that other half is not going to be a walk in the park, he said. But ten years from now, when Oxfam says that the top one per cent owns everything in the world, itll all have been worth it. "
0,"If youre a regular Home Depot customer, youll definitely want to know about this before you shop there again: The hardware company is in some seriously hot water thanks to the fact that it was just caught selling milk to one customer. Yeah, this isnt good. According to a leak from an internal whistleblower, the company placed a gallon of milk inside a cardboard box, put a barcode on the milk that would make it come up as WHITE HAMMER on a customers receipt, and put the box containing the milk toward the back of a hammer display at a Bridgewater, NJ location. Yikes. How did they think they were going to get away with this? If that doesnt sound bad enough, these leaked emails between CEO Craig Menear and Executive Vice President of Merchandising Ted Decker reveal that the decision to sell milk came right from the top: Wow. As you might expect, Home Depot has been in complete crisis mode since the story broke this morning. The companys CFO and head of PR have both resigned, and the board of directors had little choice but to immediately come out strongly against the choice to sell one gallon of milk. I deeply regret our recent decision to sell milk to one customer, and I take full responsibility for my role in the incident, said Menear in a statement to the press. Rest assured, Home Depot is committed to making sure something like this never happens again, and we will continue to focus on what we know best: home improvement. The companys apology begs the question: Is Home Depot genuinely sorry for trying to sell milk to one customer, or are they just sorry they got caught? Its something customers will now have to ask themselvesand Home Depot might not like the answer. So, yeah. This is really bad news for the nations largest home improvement retailer, and it will certainly be a story to watch in the coming weeks. "

0,"A day after President Obama held a nationally televised town hall about guns in America, a new poll shows that a majority of Republicans would rather actually be shot by a firearm than agree with him. In an indication of the challenges facing the President in persuading Republicans, those surveyed named a wide variety of specific guns that they would choose to be personally shot by rather than seeing eye to eye with Obama. When asked to state their preference, forty-three per cent stated handgun, twenty-seven per cent replied shotgun, twenty-one per cent responded assault rifle, while only two per cent named agreeing with Obama. The poll results are reminiscent of a poll taken last month about climate change, in which a majority of Republicans said they would rather see their habitat destroyed by rising sea levels than agree with President Obama.

The man, his eyes darting about menacingly, alarmed passersby who were gathering at the Super Bowl venue. Harland Dorrinson, who was participating in a pregame tailgating party, said he overheard the belligerent man making several threatening remarks. He said something like, If I go down, Im taking a lot of people with me, Mr. Dorrinson said. He also said that someone was out to get him, but he was going to get him first. He was ranting about how terrible this person was, saying, Everything our high-school social studies teacher said was true, Mr. Dorrinson added. It was the ravings of a madman. Calling the man really scary and dangerous, Mr. Dorrinson said he hoped that authorities would take the troubled individual into custody before the big game begins. Hes clearly angry and out of control, he said. A guy like that shouldnt be in a position where he can do other people harm. "

0,"Representative Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.) stirred controversy today by claiming that several key members of the Obama Administration had links to a shadowy extremist group called the Democratic Party. While Representative Bachmann produced no evidence to back up her charges, she said she had proof that members of this sinister cabal have infested the highest echelons of our government to take away our guns and replace them with gay health care. Representative Bachmann said that the member of the Administration with the closest ties to the organization is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: I have it on good authority that she is related to a former leader of the group. The Minnesota Congresspersons shocking accusations drew widespread calls for her to back down, from such disparate quarters as Senator John McCain (R., Ariz.) and the National Institute of Mental Health. Congresswoman Bachmanns comments are baseless, irresponsible, and beneath contempt, said Senator McCain. Having said that, I think I would have chosen her as my running mate over Mitt Romney. Speaker of the House John Boehner said that he now regretted making Representative Bachmann a member of the Intelligence Committee, calling that decision an example of a good-natured prank that went too far. Despite the controversy swirling around her, however, Representative Bachmann refused to cave: I dont know the meaning of the word surrender. Also, science, math, apple, and cat. "

Within an hour of the videos appearance, Trump took to Twitter to crow about his role in the jihadist promo, and tweaked his G.O.P. rivals for failing to be chosen by Shabaab. Shabaab would never put Jeb in video, Trump tweeted. Knows he is loser! But even as the billionaire boasted about his inclusion in the terror video, the prospect for future collaborations between Trump and Shabaab seemed to dim, due to a series of escalating demands issued by the real-estate magnate. In a cascade of tweets directed at the terror group, Trump insisted that he be paid two million dollars for every subsequent video and that he retain editorial control over the final cut. In a terse official statement, a Shabaab spokesman said that the terror group was discontinuing our relationship with Donald J. Trump. Hes just too hard to work with, the spokesman said.

0,"With his polite and well-mannered performance widely panned in the first Presidential debate, President Barack Obama is under mounting pressure to prove that he can act like an asshole in the second debate tomorrow night, a campaign aide confirmed. In America, we demand that our President remain cool and calm in a crisis but go batshit in a debate, the aide said. Tuesday night is all about that second piece. Rather than unspooling a laundry list of facts and numbers as he did in the first debate, this time Mr. Obama will focus on tearing Mr. Romney a new one. Unfortunately, the aide acknowledged, such classic dick moves as dismissively interrupting an opponent and laughing over his answers do not come naturally to Mr. Obama: Thats why were having Joe Biden work with him.

0,"Experts are calling for a national conversation about post-gala violence, which many say is a growing epidemic among Americas wealthiest gala attendees. Dr. Davis Logsdon, who, for the past decade, has been studying post-gala violence at the University of Minnesota, says that a national conversation about post-gala skirmishes is long overdue. For years, post-gala violence has been Americas dirty little secret, he says. The media havent covered it, and government has offered no solutions. Thats why this moment is such a valuable wake-up call. Dr. Logsdon says that the key to preventing post-gala violence is first understanding its root causes. Galas are very stressful situations, he says. Attendees have spent thousands on gowns and spa treatments, and tens of thousands more on silent-auction items. All of that pressure has to go somewhere. More often than not, it erupts into violence. He credits the national media, especially TMZ, for finally shining a light on one of the nations biggest problems. As regrettable as this incident was, if it results in people talking seriously about post-gala violence, it will all have been worth it, he says. "
1,"The Alberta province health minister wants to know if swine flu shots were 'inappropriately diverted' to the Calgary Flames while thousands had to stand in line for hours for the vaccine. Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert says he doesn't know where the NHL team got the vaccine, adding that Alberta Health Services is the only supplier in the province. Team president Ken King says the club contacted the department and asked for the clinic. Health officials have begun an investigation into the special clinic, which was held for the players and their families last Friday. Liepert says the vaccine would be diverted only with the approval of the chief medical officer of health, but he doesn't know if that was the case. Alberta's opposition parties say professional ice hockey players shouldn't be getting the vaccine ahead of cancer patients and pregnant women. "
1,"The European Parliament will likely vote Wednesday to keep Jose Manuel Barroso as head of the European Commission for five more years, backing the choice of the 27 EU leaders who see the conservative Portuguese as best suited to help steer Europe out of its recession. On Tuesday, Barroso had the support of the parliament's 256 Christian Democrats, who said they will also count on support from the Liberals (84 members) and the 55-member Conservatives group. Barroso needs a simple majority -- 369 votes in the 736-member assembly -- to be reappointed. 'We are confident the vote will go our way,' said Eduard Slootweg, a spokesman for the Christian Democratic group. However, Barroso was not supported by the parliament's 184 Socialists, who complain that he is weak on protecting EU manufacturing jobs amid the worst economic crisis in decades. 'We will not vote for Barroso,' said Martin Schulz, the parliament's socialist leader. He said that, in his first term, Barroso was overly deferential to conservative leaders in France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere who, Schulz said, have done too little to soften the impact of the financial crisis and the recession it triggered. Under EU rules, the government leaders pick a new chief for the European Commission, the powerful executive that drafts EU-wide legislation and ensures EU governments obey them. But their choice must be endorsed by the EU Parliament. The EU leaders settled on Barroso in June after European Parliament elections saw gains for conservative forces in some of Europe's largest economies -- an outcome seen as vindication of policies on company bailouts and fiscal stimulus packages to combat the recession. Barroso was to address the assembly later Tuesday to air his views for the next five years. On Sept. 3, he issued a 48-page document outlining his priorities for the 2010-2015 period. It touches on steps to encourage governments to do more to tackle unemployment, promote sustainable growth and a low carbon economy, and strengthen Europe's role in the world. In general, Socialists want Barroso to halt the flight of companies to low-wage nations and step up regulation of financial markets. Liberals want Barroso to speak up more for the protection of fundamental rights, the rights of refugees and data privacy. Greens see Barroso as weak on climate change. 'In the last two years, Barroso has put a brake on any progressive climate policy,' said Rebecca Harms, a German Green. "

The library is already charged with keeping a copy of every published work distributed in Britain and Ireland. In 2003 that remit was extended to electronic materials such as compact discs and online publications. Now the British Library says it's begun trawling through the Web and making archival copies of sites of historic interest -- including those once maintained by now-bankrupt companies such as Woolworths, Web pages spawned after the July 7, 2005 terrorist attacks in London and Internet coverage of Britain's last general election.

1,"European aerospace company EADS and officials from the seven countries that ordered its Airbus A400M military transporter wrangled anew Thursday over the financing and future of the troubled program. High-ranking defense officials, EADS' CEO Louis Gallois and representatives of the plane-making subsidiary Airbus met in Berlin, a German Defense Ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity in line with department policy. The talks, the fourth round in recent weeks, had been scheduled to last until midday but were still ongoing in the early afternoon. They coincided with a regular summit in Paris between the leaders of France and Germany, two key customers. 'We will find a solution,' French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters. 'It's a decisive project and we'll find a solution quickly.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that 'the negotiations should be continued' on the A400M. EADS has urged the seven nations -- Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey -- to increase their funding for the delayed project by (EURO)6.4 billion (nearly $9 billion). It threatened to scrap the program if no agreement is reached and originally gave the governments until the end of January to make a decision -- a deadline that was missed. France's defense minister, Herve Morin, said on Monday that he hopes the parties can agree to share the financial burden and save the project the by the end of the week. Morin has said the seven countries' defense ministers also will discuss the issue on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, that starts Thursday. The German Defense Ministry has said it is committed to finding a solution suitable for all parties. Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was quoted in a parliamentary newsletter last week as saying that the seven nations were willing to contribute a maximum of (EURO)2 billion ($2.81 billion) in extra funding. However, the Financial Times Deutschland daily reported Thursday that governments were prepared to increase their funding beyond that in an effort to find a solution. It cited unidentified industry sources. Spanish daily El Pais reported that the Defense Ministry in Madrid is proposing buyer nations pay (EURO)2.6 billion in cost overruns. A final agreement on the matter at the meeting in Berlin seemed unlikely as it would have to be agreed by the national governments, a person familiar with the talks said on condition of anonymity, citing the confidentiality of the matter. The four-engine turboprop military plane -- now four years behind schedule -- had its maiden flight in December. The price tag for the 180 planes ordered was fixed at almost (EURO)20 billion in the initial contract in 2003. The A400M is seen as occupying an important niche market between the Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules, which carries only half the payload, and Boeing's C-17 Globemaster III, which is larger, costlier, and less tactically versatile.

1,"Paris Hilton acknowledged Monday that she had cocaine in her purse and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges stemming from her arrest last month at a Las Vegas hotel-casino. She will serve a year of probation and avoid a felony charge under the terms of a plea deal worked out with prosecutors. The celebrity heiress pleaded guilty to drug possession and obstructing an officer. Hilton, 29, must complete a drug abuse program, pay a $2,000 fine and serve 200 hours of community service. Hilton -- wearing a champagne-colored blouse, a black pencil skirt and black platform heels -- told Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure she was in possession of cocaine. When he asked what she did to obstruct justice, Hilton, swaying side to side, responded, 'I said that the purse wasn't mine to the officer,' and acknowledged that she had bought it months earlier. When asked why she didn't fight the charge, her attorney, David Chesnoff said, 'Ms. Hilton accepts the responsibility.' She faces a year in jail if she violates the probation and is arrested for anything other than a minor traffic violation. Bonaventure told Hilton there are consequences to breaking the law. 'The purpose of this at this point is that you change your conduct,' Bonaventure said. 'I assure you the Clark County Detention Center is not the Waldorf Astoria.' The plea agreement does not require Hilton to be assigned a probation officer, meaning she won't have to report to anyone. She originally faced a felony cocaine possession charge that would not have resulted in jail time. Clark County prosecutor David Schubert called the plea deal, 'a fair resolution.' 'Our main concern is that Ms. Hilton stay out of trouble over the next year,' Schubert told Bonaventure. Chesnoff said Hilton would continue to volunteer with animal rights groups and children's hospitals to meet the requirements of the plea agreement. 'I know Ms. Hilton is contrite and accepts the responsibility for her actions,' Chesnoff said. Chesnoff said Hilton would attend an outpatient substance abuse treatment program. Hilton was arrested Aug. 26 inside the Wynn resort, after police say a small plastic bag containing 0.8 of a gram of cocaine spilled out of a Chanel purse she had been carrying as she reached for a tube of lip balm in front of a police lieutenant. Hilton told police the purse and cocaine were not hers, but claimed some items in the bag belonged to her, including rolling papers, $1,300 in cash and several credit cards. She was pulled aside by police after her boyfriend, Las Vegas nightclub mogul Cy Waits, 34, failed field sobriety tests given by a motorcycle officer. The couple was stopped in a black Cadillac Escalade after the officer smelled a 'vapor trail' of marijuana smoke. Hilton was banned from two Wynn resorts on the Las Vegas Strip after the arrest, and her boyfriend was dismissed as a nightclub partner. Hilton briefly faced a marijuana charge in July after a FIFA World Cup game in South Africa, but the case was dropped when a woman who was with her pleaded guilty to carrying the illegal drug. Hilton served 23 days in jail in 2007 for a probation violation after pleading no contest to alcohol-related reckless driving. At the Las Vegas Justice Court, a crowd of gawkers and photographers followed Hilton as she climbed into a black Cadillac Escalade after the hearing. Hilton also attracted a pair of colorful fans. Jake Byrd, 28, wore a shirt with an image of Hilton that read 'Stop the Prosecution' and yelled out to her. Byrd said he had traveled from Chino, California, to show support for Hilton. 'I love Paris Hilton because she's classy, sassy and brassy,' Byrd said. Claude Hudson, 74, was removed from the courtroom after he tried to give Hilton a bag of chocolate candy. He said he recently had been released from jail and had written her several letters from behind bars. During a brief news conference following Hilton's exit, Chensoff said the hotel heiress did not receive special treatment.

Christine Sidenstricker confirms that an explosion has taken place against U.S. troops in Zabul province. She says there is no report of U.S. deaths. The top Afghan official in Zabul's Shah Joy district says a suicide bomber attacked the troops while they were walking in a market. Abdul Qayum says the blast killed two Afghans and wounded 21. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and said the bomber was on a motorcycle. August is already the deadliest month of the eight-year Afghan war for U.S. troops. Forty-five have died. 
1,"NEW YORK - These days, conservatives proudly proclaim their love for the Constitution. Yet many seem unsure whether to revere it or repeal it, plank by plank. Such constitutional nihilism extends well beyond the drive to strike down the health-care law, a jarring move by those long opposed to judicial activism. It reflects a deep discomfort with the country's growth toward a thriving, coast- to-coast democracy. To be sure, these activists insist they only want to show they revere our founding document. Earlier in the year, 80 groups issued the 'Mount Vernon Statement.' 'The federal government today ignores the limits of the Constitution, which is increasingly dismissed as obsolete and irrelevant,' it said. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota and head of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress, recently said she would start another caucus, for 'Constitutional Conservatives.' One expects them to show up on C-SPAN in powdered wigs. But as for the actual Constitution, as we have lived it for two centuries, some are itching to pull out their quill pens and start furiously crossing things out. Some advocates want to rewrite the 14th Amendment, a landmark of the Constitution -- indeed, of human freedom. The amendment guaranteed equal protection of the law and due process to former slaves. Under its provisions, if you were born in the United States you had the rights of a citizen. The amendment was enacted by the Radical Republicans, which meant something very different back in 1868. Now Sens. John Kyl, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have suggested rewriting this core part of the national charter. Children born here are not in fact citizens, they argue, if their parents crossed the border illegally. In addition to punishing innocents for what their parents have done, this would rewrite a central provision of the Constitution for the sake of a temporary solution to a barely existent problem. To punish a few 'anchor babies,' they would redo the handiwork of the great Civil War amendments. Other conservatives decry the 16th Amendment, which authorized the income tax. Until Glenn Beck floated the idea of its repeal last year, it was known mostly to high school students studying for an SAT subject test. After a Gilded Age Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to tax income from property and other sources, it proved necessary to enact a constitutional change to fund the federal government. This was a breakthrough in the drive for a strong country. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said at the time, 'Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.' Most baffling of all, many Tea Party backers want to overturn the 17th Amendment, which created direct public election of U.S. senators in 1912. This was a key political reform of the Progressive Era, and a major step forward for democracy. Those who want to end direct election of senators say the step would return power to the states. Certainly, it would give state legislators more power -- and the lobbyists and party bosses who make governing such a treat in so many capitols. The thought of Albany or Sacramento choosing senators doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Lobbyist power would make us pine for the good old days of earmarks. More fundamental, why would voters want to give away the power to choose their own representatives? The original tea party called for 'no taxation without representation.' This tea party seems to pine for 'taxation with no representation.' As they target past amendments, self-designated constitutional conservatives have one of their own. Rep. Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican in line to become House majority leader next month, is among the backers of a so-called Repeal Amendment, which would give two-thirds of the states the power to nullify federal laws. This amendment, if passed, would mark the dismantling of the strong national government that has helped make the U.S. the most powerful nation in world history. It would turn back the clock not to before the New Deal, but to before the Civil War. Strikingly, these constitutional forays would repeal some of the greatest advances in democracy. A movement born as a populist squall seems oddly uncomfortable with the very mechanisms that give ordinary citizens the loudest voice. It is genuinely heartening that people care about the Constitution. The rhetoric, at least, denotes a craving for a meaningful national identity, a yearning for core values that we should all applaud. But may I suggest to our overheated fellow Americans: Don't stop at reading the Constitution. Try the Declaration of Independence too: 'All men are created equal.' Michael Waldman, former head speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, is executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the author of 'My Fellow Americans.' "
1,"HARRISONBURG, Va. - The Harrisonburg Church of Christ is an unlikely setting for a bedtime horror story, the kind of Southern Gothic tale involving murder and mendacity and money and treachery and, by many accounts, the handiwork of Satan himself. Nestled in a small town in the scenic Shenandoah Valley, the church situated on seven acres is a homey, one-story red-brick affair with a white steeple. There's a grassy yard perfect for hosting dinner on the grounds, a fellowship hall and a gravel parking lot. The people of the nondenominational church are few and mostly conservative and elderly. In the fall of 2008, this modest assembly needed a new minister. Its governing elders - Robert Thomas, a retired lieutenant from the Virginia Department of Corrections, and Gary Rexrode, a retired builder - were delighted to find that a man such as William M. Drumheller III was eager to take the job at $600 a week with free housing in the parsonage.The 66-year-old Virginia native was an ordained minister, held a master's in divinity degree, had served in the U.S. Navy and had run his own medical supply business. Tall, trim and bespectacled, with closely cropped gray hair and a steady blue-eyed gaze, 'Bill' appeared soft of voice but firm of religious conviction, quoting scripture and sprinkling his speech with biblical observations. He laughed readily and shook hands firmly, appearing if not gregarious, then highly personable. The elders hired him immediately, and Drumheller and his wife, Joyce, moved from their North Carolina home into the church's parsonage. The new minister brought to the little congregation his gentle homilies, with titles such as 'Overcoming Discouragement,' and amusing, self-deprecating tales about his golf game and family life. 'We all loved him,' said Cathy Thomas, the elder's wife. 'He could sell snow to an Eskimo.' Then, early this summer, after a series of angry confrontations with the elders, sparked by scriptural interpretations about what becomes of the soul after death, Drumheller noticed that Robert Thomas and Rexrode had added their names to the list of trustees without a vote by the congregation. Drumheller notified the local court, secretly called a meeting of a few trusted church members and orchestrated a coup, stripping both elders of their positions. Drumheller and the new board moved the church's $30,000 of savings into new bank accounts. In a later interview, he referred to the elders as a 'dictatorship' and accused them of having 'coronated' Rexrode's wife, Gilda, as church treasurer. Thomas and Rexrode were so stunned that they hired a private detective to check into Drumheller's business dealings. The investigation unearthed a stunning revelation, which soon made headlines in the Daily News-Record, the local newspaper: Drumheller - never mind his seemingly genteel nature - had beaten his girlfriend's 14-month-old son to death in 1970. There was more, too, lots more, for William Drumheller was not at all the man he had presented himself to be. 'I felt physically ill,' Thomas recalled late this summer, sitting at the kitchen table in his quiet country house a dozen miles outside of town, a cup of coffee and a plate of banana-nut muffins on the table. Rexrode, sitting across from Thomas, gazed out the window and drummed his fingers on the wooden table. On that August day, with its brilliant sunshine still holding the promise of long, languorous afternoons, two things were clear. One, the Harrisonburg Church of Christ was in the hands of the mysterious stranger who had blown into town and enchanted them all. And two, this tale would have no easy, Sunday-school ending. 'We let a wolf into the church,' Rexrode mused, 'and now we can't get him out.' - - - Drumheller's path from prison to the pulpit of the Harrisonburg Church of Christ was long and tumultuous, raising troubling questions about the nature of forgiveness and redemption. The son of a railroad brakeman and the child of divorce, Drumheller was raised mostly by his fundamentalist Methodist grandparents in Clifton Forge, Va. He joined the Navy after high school and 'explored the world and many of its opportunities,' he said in an interview. He married at 19 and had two children, settling in Illinois. The marriage wasn't happy - his wife complained to his father that he drank, couldn't keep a job and was 'being cruel' to their children, his father said in a letter to the Illinois courts pleading for leniency for his son. By 1970, Drumheller was working at a Shell station in the Chicago suburbs when he began an extramarital affair with Mary Breitweiser, a 22-year-old divorcee who worked nights on the assembly line at the Chicago Rawhide Co., he later told a prison psychiatrist. He left his family for Breitweiser and her 14-month-old son, David. Three weeks later, Drumheller became angry when the child wouldn't come when called. He beat him to death. 'I reached around in front of him and swung my hand (in a closed fist) and caught him in the stomach which jerked him off the floor up to me,' he told the court in a written statement. David's 'hands curled in and his legs drew up underneath him.' He lapsed into convulsions and died. The autopsy said the cause of death was 'explosive rupture of the stomach.' The child's lungs also had burst. He had deep bruises on his thighs and buttocks. He had severe brain damage from a blow to the head. Drumheller acknowledged to the court that he had 'chronically' abused the child. He was particularly angered, he told the psychiatrist, because the child would not cry when spanked. The psychiatrist's diagnosis: 'Inadequate personality with strong anti-social features.' A jury convicted him of murder. It sentenced him to 70 to 125 years. But once incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center, Drumheller began impressing nearly everyone he met as a sincere man who had made a horrific mistake, recalls Peter Bumpass, volunteer chaplain at the prison for nearly 30 years. 'Everyone thought the world of Bill. . . . it just seemed like a one-time incident that got out of hand.' An appellate panel reduced Drumheller's sentence, and with Bumpass' enthusiastic support, he was granted parole after 12 years. Drumheller joined Bumpass' church, got a job through Bumpass running a medical supply business, met a woman in the congregation, married and had two sons. His life, which had been condemned to the miseries of prison, seemed to have blossomed anew. But by the late 1980s, this feel-good narrative collapsed. He had an another adulterous affair - this time with a church friend's wife - Bumpass and the woman's husband recalled in recent interviews. Both marriages ended. The congregation, which had believed in Drumheller's rebirth as evidence of the Christian power of forgiveness and redemption, was mortified, Bumpass remembers. 'We certainly felt betrayed,' he said. Drumheller left the church, divorced his wife, and married the woman with whom he was having an affair. By 1989, he was running a Medicare scam, he acknowledged in a guilty plea in federal court. The case was so blatant that it was held up by the federal government as one of the nation's worst cases of Medicare fraud. 'Drumheller obtained names and health insurance claim numbers of nursing facility patients,' June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, testified to a congressional subcommittee. 'He then forged physicians' signatures . . . and filed claims for equipment . . . which he never provided.' Her statement said that former employees of Drumheller gave statements about 'episodes of sexual misconduct and violence' by Drumheller. He got a five-month prison term and an order to pay $59,000 in restitution. Meanwhile, life at home was abusive, say Drumheller's son, Peter, his stepson, Brad Karas, and stepdaughter, Amanda Jones. Peter Drumheller, 28, now works at a construction job in Chicago. Reached by phone, he said his father beat him, his brother and his mother. 'I was so near to death with him so many times,' he said, his voice shaking. 'You'd just have to run and hope he didn't find you.' He said he has been 'on suicide watch' in hospitals because of childhood physical abuse by his father. He hasn't seen or heard from his father in 17 years, Peter said. Brad Karas said he did not live with his mother - Drumheller's third wife - and his stepfather but that the visits to them were often physically violent, even in his teen-age years. 'I had so many fights with him. . . . he punched me in the face,' said Karas, now working at a resort hotel in Hawaii. Jones, now living in southern Virginia, described the end of her mother's marriage to Drumheller: 'He packed up his stuff one day while my mother was at work and left a note. . . . I haven't seen him since.' Drumheller declined interview requests for two months before finally agreeing to talk in October. He said he had accepted personal responsibility for the death of David Breitweiser and had been forgiven by God for it. He declined further comment on the killing. He declined to comment on the fraud conviction and the inspector general's testimony. He said the incidents of abuse recounted by his son and stepson were 'outright, blatant lies, unconscionable to even hear' and were fabricated by vindictive ex-wives. 'If you tell a child a story repeatedly, it's only a matter of time before they start to believe it,' he said. One of Drumheller's ex-wives could not be found, and two others did not return phone calls. The only one who would talk, briefly, was wife No. 4, Juanita Bowers. An administrative assistant in a medical business, Bowers said she met Drumheller at a Richmond bowling alley in 2000. She said they married in 2001, separated in 2003 and she divorced him in 2005. Bowers summed up her reason: 'He never told the truth about anything,' she said. - - - Harrisonburg is a quiet town about a two-hour drive southwest from Washington. It's home to about 45,000 people and two universities, James Madison and Eastern Mennonite. There's a city square with an old brick courthouse at its center, a farmers market and Jess' Lunch, which locals swear serves the best hot dogs in the hemisphere. The Harrisonburg Church of Christ sits a mile or so from the city square, just off South Main Street, between the railroad tracks and an elementary school. Churches, particularly small-town ones, are their own self-contained communities, replete with clans and cliques and power struggles, and the record shows that the 106-year-old Harrisonburg Church of Christ has not been an exception. Pastors tend not to last long; and there are reports of members being kicked out as far back as the 1970s. Just prior to Drumheller's arrival, some parishioners had been chafing at the way Rexrode and Thomas seemed to run the place as if it were their personal property, said member Mike Harlow. The previous pastor, John Doughty, had anointed the two men as elders in 2006, a position of great authority in the Church of Christ. But in 2008, Thomas and Rexrode fired Doughty, saying he didn't keep office hours and his sermons were poorly prepared. Doughty left to start a new assembly across town but wrote an angry letter back to the congregation, saying the elders were guilty of 'heresy' and were 'impostors' as elders. So, when he first took the pulpit in January 2009, Drumheller appeared a breath of fresh air to some in the church, which has perhaps 100 members, although an exact number is not kept. Shane Rickel, Rexrode's son-in-law, said he often complimented Drumheller on his sermons. 'I enjoyed him, and enjoyed playing golf with him,' said Rickel, a home builder. When relationships began to fray in June, those who were suspicious of the elders quickly sided with their impressive new minister. Drumheller had secretly videotaped an angry confrontation between himself, Rexrode and Thomas in a church office. It stemmed from a Sunday-school discussion about the fate of the soul after death. Drumheller wound up snapping 'You're a liar!' at Rexrode, and the two talked about each other's wives, the tape shows. 'Be very careful,' Rexrode warned the minister, jabbing a finger at him. Drumheller retaliated a few days later, accusing the elders of ignoring a 1987 set of bylaws and falsely telling the local court that the church had voted them to serve as trustees. He also showed his allies an edited version of the confrontation between himself and the elders. 'For many years, this congregation has been held captive under the control of Gary and Robert as elders, and by their family hierarchy,' Joan Knight, a church member would soon write to the court. 'Finally our congregation has someone to fight for us and stand with us to restore our church to the order in which it was intended by Scripture. ' She referred to Thomas and Rexrode as carrying out the 'work of Satan.' Thomas and Rexrode countered that Knight and Drumheller's other allies who were critical of them consisted of just a handful of church members, primarily newcomers, who had been unduly influenced by Drumheller. The elders tried to explain to their fellow members that, according to their interpretation of scriptures, they alone were to manage church business. When the elders filed the court documents saying there had been a church 'meeting' to vote in the new trustees, they meant only [begin ital] they [end ital] had voted on the issue, not the congregation. Before they could explain this to the church, the elders said, Drumheller had them stripped of their positions and turned the church against them. Thomas and Rexrode learned of the church coup when they discovered the church bank accounts had been cleared out. They frantically got the new bank to freeze the accounts, and fired Drumheller with a hand-delivered letter. But he ignored it, saying they had no authority, and stayed put in the parsonage. It was midsummer, and Bill Drumheller held sway over the tiny church. - - - Events turned uglier the next week in the fellowship hall. Rickel stormed into a meeting Drumheller was holding with his new church board. 'I let them get about three words out, and I took over,' Rickel said. 'I was unruly. . . . I started reeling off the murder charge, this fraud charge. I don't know if they heard what I said or just noticed the manner I said it. It's kind of forward to go in there and tell everyone that the minister is a convicted murderer. Jaws dropped.' Harlow, co-chair of the church board, was sitting beside Drumheller. Harlow was unfazed, he recalled in an interview. 'I turned to Bill and said, 'Are you a man of repentant heart?' He replied, 'Yes.' I looked back at Shane and said, 'What's your problem?' ' Harlow said the revelation was 'nothing but a character tear- down' and had 'nothing, nothing' to do with church business. Most of Drumheller's supporters, after their initial shock, agreed. 'The attitude was, 'You're just a troublemaker,' ' Rickel said. Rexrode and Thomas were aghast. Drumheller, as if by magic, actually had more support than before. The elders thought the treatment they had received was even more galling because the private investigation had revealed that the murder conviction was apparently only the biggest of Drumheller's transgressions. It turned out that the new pastor's rsum was pocked with omissions and half- truths - leading the elders and their supporters to believe that Drumheller was not just a man who had tragically once lost his temper and repented, but a man of poor character through and through. There was the fraud conviction and the alleged extramarital affairs. Drumheller's resume stated that he had left Bumpass' church in Chicago over a theological dispute about playing instruments during worship services. When told that the minister - the man who'd helped him get out of prison - said it was over an adulterous affair, Drumheller responded. 'That's his story.' When later told that Jim Karas, the woman's husband, also had said it was over the affair, Drumheller declined to comment. The rsum also listed that Drumheller had received his master's in divinity degree from 'Rochville University' in 'Rockville, Maryland.' Drumheller, in an interview, said he thought it was a legitimate online institution. But Rochville - with no campus in Rockville or anywhere else - is widely regarded as a diploma mill and is not accredited by the U.S. Education Department. Vicky Phillips, chief executive of GetEducated.com, a watchdog agency, tested the school's standards last year when she sent $499 and the name of her pooch, Chester Ludlow, to Rochville. 'Chester got full transcripts express mailed to him from a post office box in Dubai,' she said of the stunt, which gained national publicity. 'It said he graduated with distinction in finance. He had a certificate of participation in student body government. He even got a car decal.' A man reached by phone who identified himself as Allen Bradford, a 'student adviser' at Rochville, said 'no one else was available' to discuss the school's standards. He defended their practice of giving academic degrees based on 'life experience.' He said the Chester incident was unfortunate but understandable because, 'We never knew he was a dog.' Armed with their findings, the elders and their supporters began leaving flyers and packets of information about Drumheller on their fellow congregants' cars, even calling them at home. Shirley McInturff, who sided with Drumheller, told other church members that someone came to her house and scrawled 'Hi' in her driveway, which she took as a threat. In turn, some who supported the elders said they were frightened to come to church, lest Drumheller assault them. Thomas shut down the church's website, replacing it with an ominous warning: 'The Church is under Satan's attack.' Drumheller didn't wait long for revenge. On July 13, two days after delivering a sermon titled 'Truth and Love: Walking Together,' he led his followers to excommunicate the two elders, their families and several of their supporters in a blistering, eight-page letter, replete with more than 50 scriptural references. 'There has been a vicious attack against members of this assembly . . . motivated out of what is clearly anger, hatred, malice and vengeance,' the notice read. 'The sheer magnitude of sinful conduct is reprehensible, unconscionable and foremost violently opposed to the teachings of Christ.' The excommunicated were sent no-trespass orders by the church. Jesse Mace, one of the former trustees, thought it was a bluff. The following Sunday, as he and his teen-age children walked across the gravel parking lot, several men saw him and closed the church doors, he said. Drumheller 'was talking to me through a crack in the door and wouldn't let me in. I told him, 'Jesus didn't put no-trespass notices on his church! Jesus didn't put locks on his church!' ' Someone called the police. When the officers saw that Mace had a gun in his glove compartment (he had a permit, he said), he was arrested. The charges were later dropped. 'They put the handcuffs on me,' Mace said later, sitting in a coffee shop about a mile from the church. 'They put me in the back of the car. In front of my kids. I had to go sit in a cell and post bail. . . . His goal is clear. He wants to steal the church's money. The property, it's worth a lot. The man is a complete psychopath.' By August, Drumheller had been the pastor for 20 months. His congregation was in upheaval. - - - The fall turned into a series of court hearings concerning church governance and whether the old bylaws or the new elders should dominate. Drumheller's past record was deemed not admissible. Neither a judge nor a specially appointed commissioner could determine who was in charge of the church, what laws governed it or even how many members the church had. Commissioner Jay Litten, a lawyer in town, ruled in September that 'it is my judgment that the people of the Harrisonburg Church of Christ have adopted no model of self-governance which remains in effect today.' He ruled against the elders' idea that they ran the church because 'the evidence fails to establish that the congregation knowingly turned over governance of the church to the Elders.' It was a victory for Drumheller. Judge James Lane ruled that the church would have an election. Anyone claiming to have been a member with 'significant' contact with the church over the past two years could participate. Lane said he hoped that people would remember that 'they are Christians' and not attempt any shenanigans. 'I hope I never hear another case like this while I'm on the bench,' he said. The fate of the church would come down to a matter of faith. Whom did the worshipers believe - Drumheller or the elders? - - - On an afternoon in late October, with the vote a few weeks away, Drumheller, in a suit and tie, and Mike Harlow, co-chair of the church board, escorted a reporter down the center aisle and past the pews. About a dozen members were seated down front. Drumheller turned on a video camera and sat in a folding chair before the pulpit. He was ready to share his side of the story, but he had a few conditions, which he had set forth in an earlier e-mail. The interview would be taped, and the congregants would be present 'in quiet testimony and support of all who presently attend here,' he wrote. Now, seated in his chair, Drumheller seemed confident, at ease and pleasant. He produced a packet of information that he said buttressed his case. It included a videotape of that meeting he had taped in early summer with Thomas and Rexrode. (He volunteered that he had taped it secretly, without their consent, explaining that it was 'well held in the ministry' that all meetings with congregants and church leaders should be taped, even without their knowledge.) He referred to the elders as 'thugs.' He said they had taken power in 2006 and had since put in place a self-appointed 'dictatorship,' exemplified when Rexrode and Thomas had made themselves trustees and then submitted court paperwork saying the church had voted them in, he said. 'It was absolute tyrannical control over this church building and monies and everything,' Drumheller said. 'The fact that they would never allow the people a voice to speak, it just flies in the face of what the scriptures teach.' Tears came to his eyes when recounting how he had regained his faith after he killed David Breitweiser. On 'that first night where I was quietly sitting in that jail cell . . . I determined then and there, in recognition of the error of my ways, to turn my life around. 'There is literally never a day that I don't in some manner recall or have remorse or regret my actions.' But when asked why he had not told the truth about his past on his rsum, or in his job interview, he began to chuckle. 'Really?' he said. 'You cannot be that naive. I apologize for being forthright [in saying this]. But you cannot be that naive.' It was foolish to believe anyone, even a church, would ever look past child homicide, he said. Nor was the rest of his past relevant. He gave an example. A church member had once told him that he confided everything in his wife. Drumheller said he replied, 'You've got to be kidding me, right?' It was absurd for someone to tell his spouse of his 'previous escapades,' he said, and likewise for his job application in this case. He said Rickel's informing the church about his criminal past 'was disgraceful. It was egregious. It was absolutely despicable.' He said the news media and the elders had 'joined forces' to destroy his career and reputation. The packet that Drumheller put together included a four-page, single-spaced statement that he said summed up his life and career. 'It is now 39 years since I yielded my life to serving God,' it read. 'In that I do not boast or speak with pride seeing that it is not what I have done. Rather, it is what God has done and continues to do in and for me.' - - - The final vote came on a lovely fall afternoon in late November. The gravel parking lot was full and the fellowship hall was packed. More than 80 people sat in folding chairs or at tables, or stood in the kitchen. Two state police officers stood in the hallway. The first ballot would settle everything, for it asked the congregants to vote on whether they wanted the elders to rule the church, or whether they wanted the old bylaws Drumheller said should govern. Litten, the special commissioner, explained the rules, and then everyone voted. It was not close: Elders, 60; Drumheller's bylaws, 21. Shane Rickel led them all in prayer, saying the church had been reduced to a 'heap of ashes.' He prayed that the two sides would rebuild and, possibly, even reconcile. Then the members of the Harrisonburg Church of Christ walked outside into the late afternoon sunshine, gravel crunching beneath their feet. Bill Drumheller was not among them. He had resigned the week before. He and his wife had packed up their belongings and left town, leaving the people of the little red-brick church to wonder what spiritual lessons the Lord wanted them to glean from their time with the mysterious stranger who had come into their lives, dwelt and prayed among them, and then vanished. "
1,"On the eve of the end of the U.S. combat mission in Iraq, extremist groups 'are very much alive,' according to the U.S. Special Forces commander here. Though weakened by the deaths of top leaders and a drop-off in foreign funding, al-Qaida in Iraq's 'cellular structure' remains 'pretty much intact,' Brig. Gen. Patrick Higgins said in his first interview since taking command in Baghdad last fall. Members of al-Qaida in Iraq have increasingly resorted to kidnapping and extortion to stay afloat, the general said. 'The line between terrorism and criminality has blurred so much that some of these guys are just outsourcing,' Higgins said Saturday. 'We've seen indications that some of these guys for a price will put together a (roadside bomb) or do an assassination.' Although al-Qaida in Iraq no longer appears capable of carrying out the type of massive bombings that targeted prominent government buildings last year, the Sunni extremist organization and other groups continue to conduct attacks almost daily. On Sunday, at least seven people were killed in the western province of Anbar in a bombing that targeted a police convoy, Iraqi officials said, the latest in a recent string of attacks on police officers. A day earlier, at least 43 people were killed in two bombings in the southern city of Basra. Ameen Ali, a 24-year-old college student who witnessed the Basra attack, said residents were furious because they think security forces are more concerned with quelling protests over electricity shortages than pursing insurgents. 'Now when I think of what happened, I say to myself: Why should I love or stay in this country?' he said. The recent violence has complicated a period of political uncertainty, as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his chief rival in the March 7 parliamentary elections, former prime minister Ayad Allawi, fight over who is entitled to form the next government. Higgins predicted that Iraqi officials would ultimately form a representative government 'in their own Iraqi way, on their own Iraqi timeline.' But he said the attacks during this period have the potential to be particularly destabilizing. 'They're the same attacks, but they take on a greater sense of gravity,' Higgins said. The general said he worries that Iraqis are thinking, 'Oh look, the government hasn't formed and we have all these attacks going on. If we had a government, we'd have better security.' When the U.S. military draws down to 50,000 troops in Iraq by the end of the month, the U.S. Special Operations command here will remain at about 4,500-strong. Higgins said U.S. commandos have no plans to conduct unilateral counterterrorism operations in the months ahead, and he said their Iraqi counterparts have become more proficient. 'We've got them to a level of what I call good enough-ness,' he said. 'Tactically, they are very sound.' The Iraqi commandos will continue to need U.S. support gathering and analyzing intelligence and putting together cases to support prosecutions, he said. Iraq's main counterterrorism unit reports directly to Maliki, a setup many in the previous parliament protested. As a result, the unit operates with no legal mandate and subsists on funds diverted from the Defense Ministry. Higgins said that model is problematic. 'There is going to be this tin-cup mentality for (the counterterrorism unit) until they're formally, constitutionally recognized as part of the Iraqi system,' he said. -0-< Special correspondent Jinan Hussein contributed to this report.

1,"The whereabouts of a British boy kidnapped from his family's home in Pakistan was unclear Thursday, with conflicting reports about whether he has been found and diplomats scrambling for confirmation. Pakistan's High Commissioner to London, Wajid Hasan, first told The Associated Press that he had information from Islamabad that 5-year-old Sahil Saeed had been found. But within half an hour Hasan backtracked, saying he wasn't so sure. 'Now I've come to know that there's confusion about it so I don't want to make further comments,' he told the AP. In comments to BBC television at around the same time, he said that 'I think that if he has not been found he is about to be found.' Officials say Sahil Saeed was snatched from his grandmother's house in Pakistan's Jehlum city last week after robbers held the family at gunpoint for several hours. Early Thursday Sky News television, citing several Pakistani officials, said the boy had been found. British diplomats in Pakistan and London said they were urgently checking the reports, but police in Jehlum said they could not confirm he had been located. Sahil's grandfather Raja Mohammed Basharat told the AP he had no news one way or the other. 'The government has not given any information to us about the recovery of Sahil,' he said. Basharat said he had also lost contact with his son Raja Naqqash Saeed -- and British media reports said he had left for the U.K. 'I don't know where is my son, as I have no contact with him for the past four days,' he said. It was not clear why Saeed would have left the country without his son. Pakistani officials -- including Hasan -- have suggested that the kidnapping was an 'inside job' possibly involving members of the boy's family. ------ Associated Press Writer Munir Ahmad in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.

1,"Turkey is preparing to put nearly 200 active and retired Turkish officers, including former chiefs of the air force and navy, on trial for allegedly plotting to topple the Islamic-rooted government in 2003. The trial begins Thursday at a special court house in the town of Silivri, near Istanbul and marks the government's increasing confidence in confronting a military that once held sway over Turkish political life. Prosecutors have not made public any evidence or details of the accusations, but the Taraf newspaper has published what it calls leaked copies of documents pertaining to an alleged conspiracy dubbed 'Sledgehammer.' The alleged plans include blowing up at least two major mosques during Friday prayers; assassinating some Christian and Jewish leaders; and shooting down a Turkish warplane and blaming it on Greece, the country's historic rival. Taraf says the conspirators hoped the chaos would lead to calls for a military takeover, and planned to turn stadiums into open-air prisons capable of holding tens of thousands of detainees. The paper says it has provided the documents to prosecutors, who are using them in their case. The military, which has overthrown three governments since 1960 and pressured an Islamic-led government to step down in 1997, has denied such a plot, saying documents used as evidence were from a military training seminar during which officers simulated a scenario of internal strife. Unable to independently assess the evidence, Turks remain divided on the authenticity of the plot and the threat it may have posed. What is clear, however, is that the balance of power in Turkey has tipped significantly in favor of civilian authorities, whose arrests of high-ranking military officers would have once been unimaginable. In late November, the government dismissed three high-ranking officers, two major generals and a rear admiral, from duty pending the outcome of the trial, which could take at least a few years. Also among the suspects is the former head of the country's National Security Council, once a powerful group of top military officials that exerted strong pressure on the government to follow a strictly secular line, including conducting close surveillance of radical Islamic movements. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has dramatically curbed its powers since coming to power in 2002 and turned it into a merely advisory body on security affairs. All 196 suspects are free pending trial and it is not clear how many of them will attend Thursday's session, during which the court will ask every suspect to identify himself. Some officers face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin said Wednesday that a state judiciary board voted unanimously this week to replace the head judge of the court that will oversee the trial because of an ongoing disciplinary probe related to other cases. More than 400 people -- including academics, journalists, politicians and soldiers -- are already on trial on separate charges of plotting to bring down the government. That case focuses on a conspiracy by an alleged gang of extremist secular nationalists called 'Ergenekon,' the name of a legendary valley in Central Asia believed to be the ancestral homeland of the Turkish people. Critics say the cases are built on flimsy evidence and illegal wiretaps, and are designed to silence Erdogan's pro-secular opponents. The government denies the cases are politically motivated. "
1,"His marriage long ago went sour, his home taken in foreclosure, his job lost to incompetence, his finances sunk in bankruptcy. Everything Jason Rodriguez sought ended in failure. Except his alleged plot to kill. The 40-year-old man whose life seemed to just keep getting worse was charged Saturday with first-degree murder, accused of killing one and wounding five Friday at his former office. He said nothing in his brief court appearance Saturday, but his attorney portrayed him as a mentally ill man who fell victim to countless problems. 'This guy is a compilation of the front page of the entire year -- unemployment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, divorce -- all of the stresses,' said the public defender, Bob Wesley. 'He has been declining in mental health. There is no logic whatsoever, which points to a mental health case. It looks like a classic case of stress overload.' Police refused to say anything more Saturday about their investigation into the shooting. But as Rodriguez remained on suicide watch at the Orange County Jail, a portrait of his crumbling life began to emerge. He couldn't pay the child support he owed for his 8-year-old son. He was nearly $90,000 behind on bills, his bankruptcy file showed. A once-promising, but short-lived career at an engineering firm faded into a job at a fast-food chain. Wesley described his client as 'very, very mentally ill' but offered no specifics. His former mother-in-law, America Holloway, said he was a schizophrenic who was constantly paranoid, blaming others for all of his woes and who always thought everyone disliked him. The suspect's own mother struggled Saturday for words to defend her son. She could only muster an apology. 'Sorry for the families involved,' Ana Rodriguez said. 'I'm really very sorry, it is very hurtful.' Police said Rodriguez himself also offered words of remorse as he was handcuffed Friday, explaining he was just going through a tough time. But it offered little solace to victims, all of whom worked at Reynolds, Smith and Hills, where the suspect was an entry-level engineer for 11 months before being fired in June 2007. Identified as the single fatality in the shooting spree was Otis Beckford, 26, the father of a 7-month-old daughter who was standing near the receptionist's desk when the gunman entered the office. Beckford's mother told The Palm Beach Post that she had last talked to him Thursday night, firming up the family's Thanksgiving plans. 'Now, he won't be there,' Icilda Cole told the newspaper. 'Such a shame! I had two children. Otis and my daughter. I have one left. I never thought something like this would happen to him.' Five others were wounded: Gregory Hornbeck, 39; Ferrell Hickson, 40; Guy Lugenbeel, 62; Edward Severino; 34; and Keyondra Harrison; 27. All were in stable condition at Orlando hospitals and were expected to survive. Several employees reached Saturday said the firm has told them not to publicly discuss the shooting. The Legion Place building, where the shooting occurred, remained cordoned off Saturday with police tape, though some workers returned to get purses and other belongings left behind in a scramble to escape. Courtney Moore, a paralegal on the building's 17th floor, returned for her car, and remembered frequently sharing an elevator with Beckford or seeing him in the cafeteria. 'He was always so polite and friendly,' she said. As for Rodriguez, a neighbor said he moved into his mother's apartment about six weeks ago and said his appearance had grown disheveled in recent weeks. Cassandra Mizhir said she found Rodriguez 'creepy' -- whenever she sat out on her back porch to smoke a cigarette, he would stand on his nearby balcony and stare at her. She said he would sit outside the low-slung, seafoam green building in his broken-down SUV, blasting classic rock music for hours. The vehicle remained in the parking lot Saturday, a brochure on claiming unemployment benefits lying on the passenger seat. ---- Associated Press writers Antonio Gonzalez and Tamara Lush in Orlando and Sarah Larimer in Miami contributed to this report.

1,"NEW YORK - The tax compromise that the president, after protracted bargaining with Congress, signed into law Friday represents the worst of each party's principles. Democrats agreed to forgo their insistence on raising taxes to narrow the widening budget deficit. Republicans forgot (again) that they are supposedly the party of smaller government. In effect, each party stuck to the portion of its principles that will be popular with the electorate right now -- and dismissed the part that would be unpopular. The Washington compromise is symptomatic of the disease infecting government at many levels. It is known as short-termism. The better course would have been the simplest one: Let the Bush tax cuts -- on every income group -- expire. Democrats (I am one) have generally supported raising tax rates only on the rich. I never liked that approach because it's an attempt to curry favor with the majority of the public by saying, 'The deficit is not your problem; it's only the problem of wealthy people.' It sends a misleading, as well as divisive, message that, for the majority of Americans, incremental government services, such as stimulus spending or rising health-care expenditures, are free. To make serious inroads on the deficit, we should restore Clinton-era tax rates on every income group. The wealthy would suffer by far the largest incremental burden -- which is proper -- but the middle class wouldn't get a free lunch. The Republican Party has opposed restoring the old rates because, as it has repeatedly demonstrated, it is allergic to all taxes. Since it isn't opposed to government spending, only to revenue, it is hypocritical and exceptionally short-term focused. Republicans claim that higher taxes translate to lower growth. Recent evidence is to the contrary. In the 1990s, the top tax rate was 39.6 percent. The U.S. enjoyed a booming economy, warmed by the balmy breezes of a balanced budget. In the 2000s, George W. Bush cut the top rate to 35 percent. Deficits ballooned, and the economy was mostly lousy. Going back further, the connection is murky at best. In the 1960s, marginal tax rates were extremely high -- 70 percent and in some years even more. The economy roared. In the 1970s, taxes remained high and the economy slumped. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes: By 1988, the marginal rate was only 28 percent and the tax code was greatly simplified. Clearly, those giant tax cuts, plus the elimination of many loopholes, stimulated a boom. Though that decade-by-decade synopsis inevitably simplifies, the evidence suggests tax rates should be as low as possible subject to the constraint that the budget IS roughly in balance in good times, and even in bad times avoids the risk of runaway deficits. But with the government borrowing equal to 9 percent of gross domestic product, and with large entitlement- spending increases looming, we are well into runaway territory already. The evidence also shows that small changes in tax rates don't depress the economy, especially when the outlook for tax rates is consistent and when tax policy is straightforward. Current policy fails on inconsistency grounds -- given the deficit, tax rates are unsustainable. The most serious quarrel with raising rates now is that we are still emerging from a recession. But this isn't Herbert Hooverism -- the U.S. economy has grown in every quarter since mid-2009. It is true that, given the weakness of the recovery, the timing isn't ideal. However, Congress has been passing off the bad coin of the Bush tax cuts for almost a decade. Why should we think that Congress or President Barack Obama will show more courage in 2012 -- a presidential election year? For obvious humanitarian reasons, I support the extension of unemployment benefits. Obama could have proposed an additional extension in return for the lower estate-tax levels so hotly pursued by Republicans. Unlike cutting taxes on people with jobs, extending benefits to those without jobs is truly part of the safety net -- one that, if properly explained, the electorate would get. Finally, lowering the payroll tax, which will drain funds from Social Security, is incredibly shortsighted. It is only weeks since Obama's panel on the deficit highlighted the need to strengthen entitlement budgets. With the private sector recovering, albeit slowly, and public finances worsening, the time to restore our public finances to health is now. And if doing so delays the economy's return to full and robust growth, then let the recovery come more slowly -- and let it be built on sound financing and not on a new pyramid of debt. "
1,"Organizers of a march for immigrants rights in Washington this Sunday are reaching out to African Americans, hoping to bring the two communities together around an issue that has been a wedge between them. The campaign includes ads for the march on urban radio stations along the East Coast, asking for listeners to lend their support. 'Everyone has been hurt by the economy, especially African Americans and immigrants. The truth is, together you can demand real change,' the ads state. The effort is part of a broader strategy among Hispanic, black and Asian civil rights groups to unite on areas of common interest and to get Congress and the Obama administration to enact major legislation on jobs and immigration _ even while the nation's political leaders are focused on health care. 'It is a reflection of a much deeper connection between African American constituencies and immigrant constituencies,' said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, which is helping to plan the march. 'In the last year, there's been a ton of work done on the ground where immigrants and African Americans have worked together on a range of issues _ from the jobs crisis to the foreclosure crisis.' The coalition-building approach is a shift for immigrant rights groups, who held similar marches in 2006 and 2007. Then, disparate Hispanic groups spurred a large protest movement to push for citizenship for the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants, relying little on organizations outside the community. The idea of a racial coalition aims to push an overhaul of immigration law as an 'American issue, not just an immigrant issue,' said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 'Up until at least two years ago, the discussion was really being had amongst ourselves.' Immigration activists took flak _ even from supporters _ after thousands marched on the Mall to demand U.S. citizenship while carrying flags from their countries of origin. This time, organizers want to send a different signal, tying their pursuit of a wholesale overhaul of immigration law to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 'The immigrant community really holds a great deal of respect and admiration for the work that the African American community has done in the civil rights movement, and that movement is an inspiration for the immigrant rights movement,' said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, director of the National Council of La Raza's immigration campaign. Cabrera said his group spent October and November going to Sunday services at black churches across Los Angeles, sharing the stories of illegal immigrants, and they've begun sending their press releases to African American newspapers and radio shows in California. 'We don't get a lot of media requests from them, but we know that they are listening, and we know that they are getting our information,' Cabrera said. 'We are pushing against the conversation that we are taking their jobs.' But the issue of job competition remains, said Vernon Briggs, a professor emeritus of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University, who favors low immigration rates. 'What we have got here is people using immigration as a political issue to unite certain segments of the population, regardless of the economic and labor market impact,' Briggs said. 'In my view, African American workers are the most adversely affected of all groups, but many legal immigrants in the Hispanic community are also severely impacted because they are disproportionately in the low-skilled labor market where the illegal immigrants compete.' Leaders of black civil rights groups push back at that idea. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and National Urban League President Marc Morial will speak at the rally Sunday in support of providing illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship. 'This new generation of leaders recognizes the need to build stronger coalitions,' Morial said. 'It is very important that the nation's communities of color do not simply see themselves as groups competing for crumbs.' Jealous said he plans to talk Sunday about ways that overhauling immigration law will help all workers. 'There is a need for a floor for how all workers are treated,' he said. 'There is a need to ensure that nobody in this country can be forced to work in near-slavery-like conditions. So much of the black experience has been about us fighting over centuries to be part of this country, and for Latinos it's a similar story.' Last year, La Raza and the NAACP launched their first joint ad campaign in support of overhauling the health-care system. The Urban League joined with La Raza and the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development in a program to stem home foreclosures in minority communities. A similar level of cooperation is happening in North Carolina, where the state NAACP and the immigration rights group El Pueblo have formed an alliance in Raleigh. 'We found that the same forces that fight changing the laws to help immigrants, also fight civil rights, they also fight health-care reform, they also fight educational reform,' said the Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP. Tony Asion, executive director at El Pueblo, put it this way: 'If we don't stick together, then we both lose.' "
1,"The regime that ousted Manuel Zelaya in Honduras claimed Tuesday that the deposed president allowed tons of cocaine to be flown into the Central American country on its way t te Unte Sats. `Eer ngh, hre r ou Vnezuean-registered planes land without the permission of appropriate authorities and bring thousands of pounds ... and packages of money that are the fruit of drug trafficking,' its foreign minister, Enrique Ortez, told CNN en Espanol. 'We have proof of all of this. Neighboring governments have it. The DEA has it,' he added. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Rusty Payne in Washington said he could neither confirm nor deny a DEA investigation. Zelaya was traveling from New York to Washington and could not immediately be reached to respond to the allegations. Honduras and other Central American nations have become major transshipment points in recent years for Colombian cocaine, particularly as Mexico's government cracks down on cartels. The drugs arrive in Honduras on non-commercial aircraft from Venezuela and increasingly in speedboats from Colombia, according to the Key West, Florida-based Joint Interagency Task Force-South, which coordinates drug interdiction in region. In its most recent report on the illicit narcotics trade, the U.S. State Department said in February of Honduras that 'official corruption continues to be an impediment to effective law enforcement and there are press reports of drug trafficking and associated criminal activity among current and former government and military officials.' The report did not name names. Drug-related violence appears to be up in Honduras. Homicides surged 25 percent from some 4,400 in 2007 to more than 7,000 in 2008 while more than 1,600 peolewee iled eectin-tye,sugetig ru gnginolemnt accoding to the Central American Violence Observatory. In October, Zelaya proposed legalizing drug use as a way of reducing the violence. He also had pledgd to double the country's police force, which reached 13,500 last year, up from 7,000 in 2005, according to the State Department report. "
1,"Rival groups armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers battled for hours Thursday inside a Palestinian military camp in a remote part of eastern Lebanon, killing one person, security officials said. The Ein al-Bayda camp is one of several bases run by Palestinian militant groups in Lebanon. Most of them are located in the eastern Bekaa Valley near the border with Syria, whose government supports the groups. The bases, which are separate from the country's Palestinian refugee camps, are illegal. Lebanese authorities, however, have left them be for fear that any clash with the groups could be explosive. Thursday's fighting was between rival Palestinian groups and lasted three hours, Lebanese security officials said. The camp is run by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. A senior military official said the fighting stopped after four militants -- three Palestinians and a Lebanese man -- handed themselves over to Lebanese troops. Lebanese forces were seen taking up positions near the base but did not intervene. Police officials said a member of the militant group was killed in the fighting. The security and military officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations. "
1,"Michael Johnson, Nadia Comaneci, Nastia Liukin and Jackie Joyner-Kersee are among 14 Olympic and two Paralympic gold medalists who will travel to Copenhagen next week in support of Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics. Talk show queen Oprah Winfrey will accompany them. The International Olympic Committee will choose from Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo on Oct. 2. 'It's hard for me to be unbiased about this,' said Bart Conner, a Chicagoan and double gold medalist in gymnastics at the 1984 Olympics. 'When you look at the plan and the spectacular city and the legacy plan and the convenience for the athletes against the backdrop of the city, on lots of levels, Chicago gets it and understands what the Olympics is about.' That Winfrey would be part of the delegation is hardly a surprise. She's been an ardent supporter of the bid, and said this month that she'd do whatever organizers needed. When she threw a party on Chicago's famed Michigan Avenue to celebrate the start of her 24th season on TV, she said she hoped it would impress IOC members. 'I love and believe in Chicago, and I think it would be the perfect host city,' Winfrey said on Wednesday. Star power could be key in a decision that is expected to come down to a couple of votes, and Chicago will have no shortage of it. First lady Michelle Obama leads the delegation, and she'll be joined by 26 Olympians and Paralympians. President Barack Obama is still trying to decide whether to appear personally on behalf of his adopted hometown. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Johnson became the only man to win the 200 and 400 meters at the same games; Comaneci's string of seven perfect 10s at the Montreal Games captivated the world; Liukin is the reigning Olympic all-around gymnastics champ; and Joyner-Kersee is among the greatest athletes ever, winning three golds in the heptathlon and long jump. Joining them are fellow gold medalists Michael Conley, the 1992 triple jump champion who grew up near the planned Olympic stadium in Washington Park; Bryan Clay (decathlon); Brandi Chastain (football); Bob Ctvrtlik (volleyball); Donna de Varona and Gary Hall Jr. (swimming); Ron Freeman (athletics); Edwin Moses (hurdles); Kerri Walsh (beach volleyball); and April Holmes and Linda Mastandrea (Paralympic track and field); Noticeably absent is Michael Jordan, who played for the Chicago Bulls and has appeared in videos supporting Chicago's bid.

1,"JERUSALEM - A YouTube video showing a dancing Israeli soldier shimmying near a bound and blindfolded Palestinian woman went viral on the Internet this week, embarrassing the Israeli military and fueling fresh debate about morals and accountability in the armed forces. The army's chief legal officer ordered a military police investigation of the clip, which was posted two years ago but publicized this week on an Israeli television program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an emphatic condemnation. 'The Israel Defense Forces is one of the most moral armies in the world,' Netanyahu said in a statement. 'Humiliation of prisoners and detainees is not the way of the State of Israel, nor that of the Jewish people.' The conduct of Israeli soldiers in the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians had already stirred discussion this week after a military court convicted two former servicemen for using a boy as human shield during Israel's 2008-09 war in the Gaza Strip against the militant group Hamas. The soldiers had ordered the boy to open bags they suspected had been booby-trapped. The conviction, the first for a combat action during the war, served as an indicator of how effectively the military is addressing alleged violations of international law a year after a U.N. fact-finding mission accused both Israel and Hamas of war crimes. The war left as many as 1,400 Palestinians dead, hundreds of them civilians. Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians were killed. The army later conducted several high-level internal investigations and says it has questioned hundreds of soldiers and scores of Palestinians, examined more than 150 incidents and opened 48 criminal probes into alleged violations. Two-thirds of the investigations have been completed, with three indictments submitted to military courts, according to the army. Soldiers have been court- martialed in two of those cases - two in the human-shield case and one who was convicted of stealing a credit card from a Gaza home. A fourth soldier has been indicted for manslaughter in the shooting of a civilian walking with a group raising a white flag. In several other cases, officers have been disciplined, including two senior officers reprimanded for artillery shelling that hit a U.N. compound in Gaza City. Still, there is a wide discrepancy between the number of criminal prosecutions and the reported cases of killing and wounding of noncombatant civilians, as documented by human rights groups, the media and the U.N. fact-finding mission, which was headed by South African jurist Richard Goldstone. Lt. Col. Avital Leibovitz, an army spokeswoman, said the gap reflects the realities of combat as it was waged by the army against militants sheltering in a densely populated civilian environment. 'The majority of the people that were killed were terrorists - we checked each name - and this is an amazing ratio, because in similar war zones you have the complete opposite,' she said. 'We were able to develop different kinds of munitions with a very high rate of precision in order to prevent the targeting of innocent civilians.' 'The fact that we opened offices for non-governmental organizations and Palestinians to file complaints and questioned a large number of people, shows that we are going forward in a very transparent manner, and that we have nothing to hide,' Leibovitz said. Details of some military investigations have been laid out in two reports issued this year by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. But both Israeli and foreign human rights groups assert that the military's investigations are far from transparent and that little has been disclosed about the status of most cases. The army's debriefings, in which officers interview their own subordinates, are unlikely to produce a full picture of the events in question, the rights advocates say. 'A host of groups have quite serious and well-documented allegations, but we don't know which have been investigated, or if criminal investigations are open or closed,' said Bill Van Esveld, a Jerusalem-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. 'In addition to the numbers, which are very troubling, there's a lack of transparency about the criteria according to which they're closing investigations. It's good that they've prosecuted some people, but it's been too little, and too low-level.' Sarit Michaeli, spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights group B'tselem, said that the army tended to investigate soldiers for abuses such as beatings and theft more readily than killings by gunfire or shelling. According to military procedures, cases of suspected wrongdoing are examined first through debriefings within the units involved, and if those produce findings that justify a criminal investigation, the army's advocate general can order a probe by the military police. The military's approach 'that in a situation of armed conflict, hardly any behavior by a soldier is cause for a criminal investigation is one of the root causes of the culture of impunity in the army,' Michaeli said.

1,"The first officer of the Northwest Airlines jet that missed its destination by 150 miles (240 kilometers) says he and the captain were not sleeping or arguing in the cockpit but he wouldn't explain their lapse in response and the detour. 'It was not a serious event, from a safety issue,' pilot Richard Cole said late Friday in front of his Salem, Oregon, home. 'I would tell you more, but I've already told you way too much.' Air traffic controllers and pilots had tried for more than an hour Wednesday night to contact the Minneapolis-bound flight. Officials on the ground alerted National Guard jets to prepare to chase the airliner, though none of the military planes left the runway. The jet with 144 passengers aboard was being closely monitored by senior White House officials, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro told The Associated Press on Saturday. He didn't say if President Barack Obama was informed. Many aviation safety experts and pilots say the most likely explanation is that the pilots fell asleep along their route from San Diego. NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said fatigue and cockpit distraction are factors that will be looked into. 'We were not asleep; we were not having an argument; we were not having a fight,' Cole said, but would not discuss why it took so long for him and the flight's captain, Timothy B. Cheney, of Gig Harbor, Washington, to respond to radio calls. 'I can tell you that airplanes lose contact with the ground people all the time. It happens. Sometimes they get together right away; sometimes it takes awhile before one or the other notices that they are not in contact.' The FAA said Friday letters had been sent informing the pilots they are being investigated by the agency and it is possible their pilot's licenses could be suspended or revoked. Investigators were in the process Saturday of scheduling interviews with the pilots, Holloway said, and audio from the cockpit voice recorder was downloaded at NTSB headquarters on Friday. But they may not glean much from it. While new recorders retain as much as two hours of cockpit conversation and other noise, the older model aboard Northwest's Flight 188 includes just the last 30 minutes -- only the very end of the flight after the pilots realized their error over Wisconsin. The NTSB recommended a decade ago that airlines be required to have two-hour cockpit voice recorders. The standard has been 15- to 30-minute recorders. Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a rule requiring airplanes and helicopters seating 10 or more people to have the 2-hour audio recordings, but gave the industry time to comply. Aircraft made after March 2010 must come equipped with longer recorders, though many manufacturers have already been including them. Existing planes have until March 2012 to comply. The FAA rule doesn't require cockpit video recordings, which the NTSB had also recommended. Pilots opposed the video recordings. Northwest, which was acquired last year by Delta Air Lines, is also investigating the incident. Cheney and Cole have been suspended. Messages left at Cheney's home were not returned. The pilots passed breathalyzer tests and were apologetic after the flight, according to a police report released Friday. Cheney and Cole had just started their work week and were coming off a 19-hour layover, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Saturday, citing an internal Northwest document it said was described to the newspaper. The police report said that the crew indicated they had been having a heated discussion about airline policy. ------ AP Writers Joan Lowy in Washington and Amy Forliti in Minneapolis and AP Airlines Writers Joshua Freed in Minneapolis, Harry R.

1,"Howard Buffett, designated the next chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, was touted by his brother as a guarantor of the firm's values who shouldn't be expected to match the investing record of their father, Warren Buffett. 'That's like asking Sean Lennon if he could go write Beatles songs' like his father, John Lennon, said Peter Buffett, a musician and the youngest of the billionaire's three children. 'I don't think my brother would want to take on the level of intensity my dad brings to it. Who could?' Warren Buffett, 79, amassed the world's third-biggest personal fortune through four decades of stock picks and takeovers at Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire. Most of that wealth, valued by Forbes at $47 billion, will go to charity after he dies. His children will be left with a legacy of ethics and independence that Peter Buffett, 51, says in a new book is worth more the cash. 'It is not about stuff, it's not about accumulation or the bling,' Peter Buffett, whose 'Life Is What You Make It' is published by Random House's Harmony Books, said Mondayin a telephone interview. 'It's about loving your life and doing something for the world around you and not just for your personal gain. Those are the values my parents had.' Warren Buffett's wealth soared as bets on Coca-Cola, Geico and MidAmerican Energy Holdings boosted Berkshire's stock 18-fold over the last two decades. Buffett, who owns a quarter of Berkshire and is its chairman and chief executive officer, makes a $100,000 salary and hasn't had a raise in more than a quarter century. Susan Buffett, Peter's mother, was a Berkshire director and a philanthropist until her death in 2004. In 'Life,' which goes on sale Tuesday, Peter Buffett decries the corruption, emptiness and bad parenting that often accompany great wealth. In contrast, he says that from his early 20s, he was forced by his father's design to live on a budget and find a career. His 'family inheritance' of about $90,000 in Berkshire shares, which he got at age 19, was no more than enough to quit Stanford University and get a start in music. 'It was understood that I should expect nothing more,' Peter Buffett said in the book. 'I used my nest egg to buy something infinitely more valuable than money: I used it to buy time.' Those Berkshire shares would be worth about $72 million today, he said. Peter Buffett moved to San Francisco and found work composing 10-second interludes for the startup MTV cable network. He lived frugally, driving a 'crummy old car,' according to the book. Warren Buffett encouraged his son's pursuit of music and likened it to his own passion for Berkshire, which he'd transformed from a failing textile maker into a $200 billion insurance, energy and consumer goods provider. 'You know, Pete, you and I really do the same thing,' Warren Buffett said, according to Peter's account. 'Music is your canvas. Berkshire's my canvas and I get to paint a little every day.' Warren Buffett hasn't announced plans to retire and in February completed the biggest takeover of his career, the $27 billion acquisition of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. Berkshire plans to split Buffett's executive duties between a CEO and an investment head when he is no longer able to lead the firm. Howard Buffett, 55, a director and a farmer, would be an effective chairman, his father said after the 2006 annual meeting. 'I would hope they will make Howard the non-executive chairman,' Buffett said at a press conference in Omaha. Preserving the values of Berkshire would be 'the big reason for him being there,' he said. Buffett's oldest child is named Susan. In 2006, Warren Buffett committed $1 billion to each of his children to give away in charitable donations. Peter Buffett wrote jingles for clients including CNN, Headline News and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which counts Berkshire as its biggest investor. He composed a two-minute piece for Kevin Costner's film 'Dances with Wolves' and the full score for '500 Nations,' the eight-hour CBS miniseries, according to Buffett's Web site. "
1,"San Silawat has three dogs, two cows and a parrot. He grows rice and spring onions on a small plot of land. But he's hardly a pauper: He's added a second floor to his house and built a blue-tiled patio. His son plays computer games in the front room. His daughter recently bought a Nissan pickup truck. His granddaughter studies nursing in Bangkok. For all his relatively good fortune, however, San is certain about one thing: 'Life is definitely getting worse,' said the 62-year-old farmer, grumbling about the price of gasoline, school fees and a political and economic system he sees as rigged in favor of the rich. Last month, San and six friends from this village in northeastern Thailand piled into a pickup and drove 14 hours to join 'red shirt' protests in Bangkok. During nine weeks of demonstrations, scores of other rural folk from Nonbon and nearby settlements made the same 390-mile trip. Beneficiaries of an economic boom that, in just three decades, has cut the proportion of Thais living below the poverty line from 42 percent to about 8 percent, San and his family represent both the promise and the peril of Asia's dizzying transformation. From China in the north to Indonesia in the south, hundreds of millions of people are now living far better than a generation ago. But the gap that separates them from the rich has often grown wider. As their fortunes and expectations have risen, so too has their frustration. And, as recent turmoil in Thailand has shown, this can mean big trouble. San and his neighbors rallied to the red shirts not because they are hungry, uninformed and desperate but because they are no longer any of those things. Though still very poor compared with Bangkok residents who cheered the red shirts' defeat when government troops moved in on May 19, they are a better-off, better-informed and far more demanding voice in national affairs than their elders. San buys and reads a newspaper every day. 'Farmers in the past didn't ask for anything. They just did their farming,' said his daughter, Tasaneeporn Boran, standing next to her brand-new black Nissan, which she bought in February. 'We now know what is going on,' she said. 'We know what we want and don't want.' What she doesn't want most of all is a 'government that only looks after the rich, instead of ordinary people.' It is a demand that raises alarming questions not just for Thailand's Eton- and Oxford-educated prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, but for governments across Asia struggling to manage rising expectations amid growing, but unevenly spread, prosperity. Thailand's protests began in March not during a recession, but as the economy recorded first-quarter growth of 12 percent, its strongest performance in 15 years. China, meanwhile, saw its economy surge by 11.9 percent _ and has since been hit by a wave of labor unrest, including a strike over wages at a Honda factory in Guangdong, one of the country's wealthiest regions. China's Communist Party has staked its future on a bet that economic growth will reinforce, not undermine, stability. But Thailand's experience shows how easily such calculations can come unstuck. Instead of political calm, growth in Thailand has brought increased tension. When the country set off the 1997 Asian financial crisis and fell into a deep slump, political stability in Thailand actually increased and then plunged as the economy took off again, according to the Worldwide Governance Indicators, compiled by experts from the Brookings Institution and the World Bank. Over the last four decades, Thailand's economy has grown an average of about 7 percent a year, and average real per-capita income has roughly tripled since the mid-1980s. But, according to a recent report on Thailand last year by the United Nations Development Program, the Southeast Asian nation is beset by 'persistent inequality' that defies a widely accepted theory that the gap between rich and poor widens during an initial phase of development but then narrows. Thailand's income inequality is roughly the same as that of much poorer nations such as Uganda and Cambodia and slightly worse than that of China and the United States, both highly unequal in terms of income distribution, according to data in the United Nations 2009 Human Development Report. (Optional add end) Despite the income gap, the people of Nonbon have unquestionably benefited from their country's rapid development. Tasaneeporn recalled growing up in the 1970s with no electricity, no running water and no paved roads. Only one family had a TV. The main economic driver in the region at the time was the U.S. Air Force, which used a big airfield in the nearby city of Ubon Ratchathani to launch bombing runs over Vietnam and Cambodia. Now, a recently widened four-lane highway _ dotted with convenience stores and shopping centers _ connects Ubon Ratchathani, the regional capital, to farmland around Nonbon. Tasaneeporn's brother recently got work in the city at a new luxury hotel. The job gives him a small, steady income _ and puts him in daily contact with people who have far more money. The most vocal red shirt supporters in these parts are not the destitute _ people like Sritta Sorsrisuk, a 71-year-old farmer who has seen two of his six children die. 'I don't care about politics,' he said, sitting in a tumbledown shelter next to his tiny plot of land. But others 'talk about it all the time: red this, red that.' "
1,"The gunmen arrived in the Amazon dusk, circling the house where Sister Leonora was hiding, rifles and pistols poking out the windows of three muddy pickup trucks. A violent death was meant for the diminutive 64-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who has spent decades defending poor, landless workers -- and collecting countless threats from ranchers she blocked from stealing Amazon land. Leonora Brunetto faced the fate of Brazil's renowned rain forest protector Chico Mendes and American nun Dorothy Stang, whose accused killer is scheduled for retrial Wednesday in the jungle city of Belem. But before the gunmen could put her among the 1,200 activists, small farmers, judges, priests and others killed over preserving the rain forest since Mendes' murder in 1988, a car full of landless workers pulled up to defend Brunetto. The gunmen left, opting to take their shot at the gray-haired woman another day. One of those who came to her rescue, though, was shot dead the next afternoon. As in many of the cases, his killer still walks free. Impunity in the Amazon because of a weak judicial system and corruption among local officials is endemic, a problem not only for people like Brunetto, but for the Brazilian government trying to preserve a rain forest the size of the U.S. west of the Mississippi. More than 20 percent of the forest already has been destroyed. Rancher Vitalmiro Moura, who is accused of ordering Stang's murder in 2005, served three years in prison before being acquitted in a retrial. Now prosecutors are trying to get a conviction again in a third trial, which his defense team is seeking to delay. Among hundreds of cases of activist killings, Moura is the only accused mastermind imprisoned while he awaits retrial, according to the Catholic Land Pastoral, a watchdog group that tracks rural violence in Latin America's largest nation. He has said he had nothing to do with Stang's killing and had no involvement with the land dispute that led to her death. Stang prosecutor Edson Souza said bringing killers to justice and stopping the bloodshed is the only way Brazil will halt the destruction of the jungle. 'Without a doubt, leaders like Dorothy are targeted,' Souza said. 'If they get away with killing leaders like Dorothy, the poor rightly assume they could easily be murdered as well.' The main cause of deforestation, the government says, are ranchers who illegally clear jungle to graze cattle and grow soy -- often using threats and violence to remove the poor farmers eking a living there. The Brazilian government aims to give land titles to poor farmers, who some argue are less destructive to the forests because they have small plots and do less clearing. But the process has required people like Stang and Brunetto, who help locals stand up to intimidation against their claims on unused land. The episode in 2007 of gunmen circling Brunetto's safe house was just one of many brushes with death she recounted as she showed The Associated Press around an area of Mato Grosso state where she works, raising the spirits of those who camp on unused property and wait years for titles. A Brazilian who studied to join the convent from age 12, Brunetto used to travel only with armed military police. But she has stopped. 'I have many friends under death threats, but they have no protection,' she said. 'How can I lead people if I have protection and they don't? Besides, it's the people who protect me most.' Mato Grosso -- 'thick jungle' in Portuguese -- was once rain forest but is now the breadbasket of Brazil with its vast soy plantations and cattle ranches. The ranchers and farmers who rule the state live well, employing legions of landless farmworkers for a pittance. Those workers face hunger and disease in makeshift shelters built from scrap wood and black plastic, with no electricity or running water. 'A few with much, and many with so little,' Brunetto said. She spoke at a dusty camp of squatters, who live at the edge of a local farmer's land they say is unproductive -- and thus, according to Brazil's constitution, available for redistribution. 'How can you fold your arms in front of this injustice? I can't.' Brunetto, 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and 110 pounds (50 kilograms), walks through the camps in jeans and leather sandals, firmly shaking hands and giving hugs. She patiently listens as a shirtless man tells her about hothouse-grown plants residents sell for 50 cents each, then turns to a nearly toothless woman who worries about getting enough food to eat. The squatters are star-struck. 'Sister Leonora is a warrior for the people,' said Linda Maria de Jesus, a 59-year-old camp resident who was on the verge of tears at seeing Brunetto. 'She is threatened; she is in a battle just like us. It raises our spirits to have her here.' Brunetto is rarely out of the watchful gaze of one hulking -- though unarmed -- poor farmer or another. They pick her up at bus stations, drive her 100 miles (160 kilometers) then hand her off like a sacred package to another rural worker, who will take her on to her destination. She meets with local, state and federal officials to press the numerous cases of small farmers fighting for land. She helps impoverished, illiterate people work their way through the onerous process of winning a title to a piece of property. 'I'm always looking over my shoulder wherever I go,' Brunetto said after offering the squatters praise for their makeshift plant nursery. Souza, the prosecutor, has seen numerous killers walk free in neighboring Para, the Amazon region's most violent state, where the 73-year-old Stang was gunned down on a muddy dirt road. He argues she was ordered killed by Moura and fellow rancher Regivaldo Galvao because she was blocking them from obtaining land the government had given to a group of poor farmers. The confessed gunman who shot her is serving a 27-year sentence in prison. Two other men were convicted as accomplices in 2005 and given 17-year sentences. Galvao has managed to remain free -- but is scheduled to go to trial at the end of April. Brazil is trying to bring law to the Amazon, mostly through increased environmental agent patrols the government says resulted in the lowest recorded levels of deforestation in 2009. What remains to be seen is what can be done to protect those protecting the forest. 'I cannot lie and say I'm not scared,' Brunetto said. 'But at the same time I know God is with us. My two great protections are God and these people we help.' "
1,"Luis Urzua went to work as a shift foreman at the San Jose gold and copper mine in northern Chile on Aug. 5. A month later, the steely 54-year-old has yet to relinquish his command, pivoting to the challenge of organizing the increasingly sophisticated existence of 33 men facing long-term entrapment underground. In the miner's hierarchical world, a supervisor effectively becomes 'owner of the mine' during his typical 12-hour shift, according to Chile's health minister, Jaime Manalich. 'It is a military discipline,' he said Friday. 'Natural selection is extremely strong in this world. This is an extremely dangerous job.' Urzua is up to the task, according to Andres Llarena, a physician and commander in the Chilean navy who is at the mine helping coordinate medical aspects of the rescue operation. 'He is a leader in his field and has been for ages,' Llarena said. For Urzua, the command challenges began within moments of the mine collapse. According to rescue workers, Urzua quickly ordered his men to huddle while he took three miners on a scouting mission. Correctly deducing that the group was trapped, Urzua instituted a set of rules that would be crucial to the men's survival, including the strict rationing of the mine's limited stash of emergency food - two spoonfuls of tuna and half a glass of milk per man every 48 hours. As rescuers spent 16 days vainly attempting to drill a rescue hole 2,300 feet to the trapped men, Urzua also used his skills as a topographer to chart the miners' underground world, which includes more than a mile of tunnels and caves and a 35-square-yard refuge, as well as a gallery where the men sleep. With a white Nissan Terrano pickup as his office, Urzua drew detailed maps, dividing the accessible space into a work area, a sleep area and a sanitary facility. He also kept the men on a 12-hour shift schedule, using the headlights of trucks to simulate sunlight. When the first letters from the trapped men arrived topside, rescue workers were heartened to see the messages carefully worded and dated, a sign the miners were not disoriented. 'You think they wrote those letters in the moment? No,' Manalich said. 'Urzua had that material prepared. He knew there would be a rescue mission.' The rationing of food was a particularly prescient move by Urzua. When rescuers finally drilled through the roof of the miners' shelter, the workers had run out of food and had not eaten in 48 hours. 'Their health was on a curve like this,' Manalich said, slicing his hand downward. As Urzua's 12-hour shift stretches to a month, the former football coach has such complete control over the situation that during a daily medical conference call Friday, Urzua told Manalich, the health minister: 'Keep it short. We have lots of work to do.' Indeed, as the miners' saga shifts from basic survival to active participation in a complex rescue plan, Urzua has many tasks to oversee. On Saturday, the men began the move to a new shelter, a drier area about 200 yards farther down the shaft. They had already spent days reinforcing the roof. Urzua receives three daily briefings - one from a doctor, another from a psychologist and the third a miner-to-miner update on the technical aspects of the rescue operation. The Chilean government has in place three rescue plans. Known as plans A, B and C, each effort represents a multimillion-dollar gamble _ and each depends on Urzua's ability to organize his crew to help. 'You realize that if we do it this way, there will be some 70,000 liters of water coming down into your chamber,' said Andre Sougarret, the rescue mission's lead engineer, as he briefed Urzua by telephone Friday. For 10 minutes, Urzua and Sougarret discussed plans to construct drainage and holding pools and canals to shunt water away from the miners' living quarters. An audio recording of their conversation would have sounded like a normal back- and-forth between manager and shift supervisor. In fact, Sougarret was standing in a windswept tent, speaking into a Nitsuko phone system the size of a small suitcase, with cables running almost half a mile into the ground, where a weary Urzua prepared for a mission that will determine whether 33 men survive. 'I fully believe they will do it,' said Al Holland, a psychologist with NASA who had traveled to Chile to share the agency's experience with human isolation in extreme environments. 'The miners are quite hearty, quite resilient. ... They have shown every sign that they can organize themselves. They are masters of their own fate.' "
1,"Everton wants to keep United States midfielder Landon Donovan beyond his 10-week loan period and says it has already had promising talks with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Donovan has made a real impact in the English Premier League, winning praise from club manager David Moyes and the Goodison Park fans, who have started a Facebook campaign to keep him. Moyes says there has been contact with the Galaxy, who he thinks might say 'yes' to a longer-term deal. He adds that Donovan, who is expected back for the Galaxy's opening Major League Soccer game on March 27, is keen to stay. But Moyes also says that nothing has been confirmed. Donovan was Everton's player of the month for January and the team has moved into the top half of the standings since he arrived. "
1,"The newest U.S. texting champion has a message for parents across the land -- although they might not want to hear it. 'Let your kid text during dinner! Let your kid text during school! It pays off,' 15-year-old Kate Moore said Tuesday after winning the LG U.S. National Texting Championship. After all, she said: 'Your kid could win money and publicity and a phone.' For the Des Moines, Iowa, teenager, her 14,000 texts-per-month habit reaped its own rewards, landing her the competition prize of $50,000 just eight months after she got her first cell phone. Moore, with a speedy and accurate performance, beat out 20 other finalists from around the U.S. over two days of challenges such as texting blindfolded and texting while maneuvering through a moving obstacle course. In the final showdown, she outtexted 14-year-old Morgan Dynda, of Savannah, Georgia. Both girls had to text three lengthy phrases without making any mistakes on the required abbreviations, capitalization or punctuation. Moore squeaked through by a few seconds on the tiebreaking text, getting the best two out of three. As she anxiously waited for confirmation of her win, tears streamed down her face. The teen dismisses the idea that she focuses too much on virtual communications, saying that while she has sometimes had her phone taken away from her in school, she keeps good grades, performs in school plays and socializes with friends -- in person -- on the weekends. In between, she finds time to send about 400 to 470 texts a day. Among her uses of the text messages? Studying for exams with friends, which she says is better done by text because she can look back at the messages to review. The finalists, all 22 or younger, were among 250,000 people who tried to get spots in the competition. Some won their spots at the Manhattan finals by being the fastest people to text responses to televised ads. It's the third year for the texting competition, sponsored by LG Electronics Inc.'s mobile-phones division. But it's the first time that it was held at a flashy sound stage with an illuminated platform and surrounded by TV cameras. LG, based in Seoul, South Korea, is considering using the footage in a televised special of some kind. Twenty-year-old Jackie Boyd, who came in fifth in the competition, said she usually prefers text messages to phone calls because they get through faster and they're more private -- leaving her unworried about other people listening in. 'You can get more of what you really truly want to say' across with texting, said the Syracuse University psychology major. 'Especially if it's an argument, you don't have to worry about saying the wrong thing. 'And if you don't want to respond, you can always say, 'Oh, I didn't get your text.'' ------ On the Net: LG U.S. National Texting Championship: http://www.lgtexter.com/ "
1,"For half a century, we've been told that saturated fats are bad for our hearts. That belief led to what many now consider the disastrous switch from saturated- fat-filled butter to trans-fat-filled margarine as the bread-spread of choice. It also led to the government's recommendation, through its Dietary Guidelines for Americans, that we limit saturated fat to less than 10 percent of our daily calories. But the latest science has many experts reconsidering saturated fat. A study published in the March issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, for instance, found insufficient evidence linking saturated fat intake to cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease. Another study in that issue suggested refined carbohydrates and being overweight are the true culprits. And they're just the latest to suggest that sat fat has gotten a bad rap. Riding high on the wave of saturated fat's rehabilitation, the famous Atkins Diet has been revamped with an eye toward making it easier to understand and maintain. 'The New Atkins for a New You' (Fireside, 2010) allows dieters to eat more vegetables than the old version did. But the diet's core concept _ that carbohydrates, not saturated fat, are what makes us fat _ remains intact. Atkins old and new aim to rejigger metabolisms so people burn their fat, including stored body fat, instead of carbs. The new book, written by Eric Westman, Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek, guides dieters through four phases, from 'Induction' through 'Lifetime Maintenance.' Atkins followers are encouraged not to count calories and are told that their cravings for carbs will swiftly diminish. Westman says one of the chief differences between the new and old Atkins (made popular in the early 1980s with the paperback release of 'Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution') is the clarification that the most-restrictive Induction phase accounts for just the first two weeks of the diet and that people with less weight to lose might choose to skip that part altogether. In any case, the Induction phase allows dieters to eat some 'foundation' vegetables: leafy, fiber-filled and unstarchy ones such as cauliflower and spinach. As the diet continues, followers can gradually add carbohydrates until they find an amount they can accommodate without gaining weight. Long-term adherence is one of the problems the new Atkins hopes to solve, giving followers options that include adding more fruits, grains and legumes to the mix. The case for Atkins has been bolstered a bit by two developments. First, the nutrition community has largely accepted that low-fat diets tend not to work because people replace the missing fats with extra carbohydrates. Joan Salge Blake, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, notes that the 'Snackwell phenomenon' demonstrated that people assume low-fat cookies are low in calories, too, and they overeat. The second development is the widespread embrace in nutrition circles of the Mediterranean-style diet, which emphasizes heart-healthy fats such as those in olive oil and nuts. Of course, there's not a lot of bacon or butter in the Mediterranean diet, which is favored by the American Dietetic Association. It focuses on a healthful balance of fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and that most empty of all carbs, alcohol. Atkins breaks with current weight-management thinking in two notable ways: allowing followers to incorporate as much (or little) exercise as they want, and encouraging sodium consumption. 'If you don't have a salt-sensitive condition like heart failure, salt in the diet is not restricted on Atkins,' Westman explains by e-mail. Adequate sodium intake, the book notes, helps counter the low-carb diet's diuretic effect. The new Atkins, like the old, emphasizes that 'fat is your friend,' even as it encourages folks to eat protein. If you prefer a lean skinless chicken breast, go ahead and have it _ just add a dash of olive oil or a pat of butter. Wrote Westman: 'On Atkins, bacon is a healthful protein! ... The New Atkins is placing more emphasis on the four phases which gradually reintroduce carbs, to get away from the stereotype that `Atkins is all-you-can-(eat)-bacon.' ' The book cites more than 50 studies that support its approach, and its new, more flexible and friendly presentation will undoubtedly make it attractive to former Atkins-ites and new adherents. For my part, until we fully understand the dietary implications of saturated fats and unsaturated fats, I'm not going to put all my, er, eggs in one basket by going gung-ho with Atkins, new or otherwise. On the other hand, the Atkins approach has made many reconsider the basics and un-demonize some dietary demons. So, for the freedom to enjoy a pat of butter now and then, I thank the authors. "
1,"The lawyer for a sports doctor who has treated Tiger Woods says the superstar golfer is in no way linked to the drug-related conspiracy charges Dr. Anthony Galea faces. Galea, 51, is facing four charges related to the unapproved drug known as Actovegin. He has been charged with conspiracy to import an unapproved drug, conspiracy to export a drug and smuggling goods into Canada. His lawyer, Brian Greenspan, said Friday that those charges are in no way related to Woods. Greenspan says Actovegin is used worldwide and there was nothing unlawful about Galea's use of the substance. Actovegin, which contains calf blood, has stirred up controversy over its efficacy and legality. It's not on the list of banned substances for the World Anti-Doping Agency, unless it's used by intravenous infusion. "
1,"Relations between Israel's Jewish majority and its Arab minority have never been warm, but they appear to have hit a new low that has activists on both sides worried the troubled relationship is beyond repair. In the past month alone, Israeli lawmakers have introduced a series of bills that aim to marginalize Arabs. Rabbis in a northern town have urged followers not to rent homes to Arabs. Extremist Jews marched through this town and set off a violent riot. And a prominent Arab activist has admitted in a plea bargain to spying for the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah. These repeated run-ins have threatened to turn what has long been an atmosphere of distrust into open hostilities as Jews increasingly question the loyalty of their Arab neighbors while jittery Arab residents fear they are being unfairly characterized as a threat from within. 'The Arab community is terrified. They see the legislation, they feel the atmosphere. They see the discourse and they feel insecure. They feel like they need to protect themselves,' said Jafar Farah, head of 'Musawa,' an organization promoting equality for Arab residents. 'And some of these people think they should fight back.' Arabs form about one-fifth of Israel's population of some 7.4 million. In contrast to their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights that give them access to Israeli social services and other benefits. For the most part, however, they identify with Palestinians. They also tend to be poorer and less educated than their Jewish compatriots and often suffer outright discrimination. While relations have always been cool, the situation took a major turn for the worse a decade ago after the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising. At the time, thousands of Israeli Arabs rioted for days in solidarity with the Palestinians, and Israeli police killed 13 Arab citizens while trying to quell the unrest. For Arabs, the 2000 unrest became a symbol of their grievances. For many Jews, the events instilled doubts that the Arab community could be loyal to Israel and raised fears the Arabs could actively try to help the country's enemies. Those fears have been compounded by events since. Israel's ultranationalist foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, led his Yisrael Beitenu party to large gains in last year's parliamentary elections by questioning the loyalty of Israel's Arabs. Last month, Lieberman managed to win Cabinet approval for his proposal to force non-Jewish immigrants to swear a loyalty oath to a 'Jewish and democratic' state. The measure, which won support from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was widely seen as a swipe against Arabs since it wouldn't apply to Jewish immigrants. Another coalition partner proposed a bill that would allow small communities to exclude potential residents, bringing charges of racism from Israeli Arabs. The deputy mayor of the northern Israeli town of Carmiel, Oren Milstein, meanwhile, urged residents not to rent or sell their homes to Arabs, according to local media reports. The politician's office did not return messages seeking comment. In the nearby town of Safed, prominent rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu has warned Jews from doing the same. And last week, several dozen ultranationalist Jews marched through the hilly Arab town of Umm el-Fahm, chanting 'death to terrorists,' touching off clashes between rock-hurling residents and police firing tear gas. 'I'm scared for the future, and I'm scared for my children,' said Saeb, a 37-year-old social worker who declined to give his last name, fearing he would get in trouble with his employer. Many Jews, however, have real concerns that Israeli Arabs pose a potential threat, fueled by a series of high-profile cases involving Arab politicians. Last week, Amir Makhoul, a leading community activist, pleaded guilty to handing sensitive information to Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla group that fought an intense monthlong war against Israel in 2006. He faces up to 10 years in prison. In May, lawmaker Hanin Zoabi triggered harsh Jewish criticism by joining a Turkish flotilla trying to break Israel's blockade of Hamas-ruled Gaza. Zoabi, an outspoken critic of Israel, was nearly attacked on the floor of parliament and called a traitor after the incident. Another lawmaker, Azmi Bishara, fled the country three years ago to avoid facing similar espionage charges. Living in exile, he has since become a frequent participant in Arabic TV panels, heaping scorn and criticism on Israel and its policies toward Palestinians. Ordinary Israeli-Arabs also have moved toward more extreme groups, like the radical northern Islamic Movement, which has close ideological ties to the militant group Hamas. It counts 'tens of thousands' of followers, said its acting leader, Sheik Kamal Khatib. Others have become fervent supporters of Bishara's and Zoabi's Balad Party, which emphasizes Palestinian identity. Many party members and supporters want Israel to be dissolved and ultimately merged with the Palestinian territories. 'We have never been Israeli, and we won't be. We are Palestinians,' said actor Hasan Taha, 27. Such views have fueled Jewish anxiety, which in turn has led to support for hard-line politicians like Lieberman, said Amnon Beeri-Sulitzeanu, co-director of the Abraham Fund, a Jewish-Arab organization seeks to promote coexistence. Beeri-Sulitzeanu said although violence is down from 10 years ago, the situation is far more dangerous because the push to isolate the community was being led by politicians, elected community officials and religious leaders -- not by rabble rousers. 'What we are seeing is unprecedented,' Beeri-Sulitzeanu said, adding there is 'racism and alienation and a very coordinated attempt to marginalize and push the Arab community to the corner.' "
1,"The Obama administration had expected Chrysler's sale to Italy's Fiat to close more than a week ago, and perhaps to have seen the automaker already emerge from bankruptcy protection. But the Supreme Court's decision to delay the sale while it studies an appeal now threatens to derail Chrysler's restructuring plans. Meanwhile, dealers opposing the termination of 789 Chrysler franchises return to court Tuesday. Chrysler is working to reduce its dealer ranks by about 25 percent as part of its cost-cutting actions. But the move, which still needs bankruptcy court approval, is being challenged by a group representing more than 300 dealers, as well as individual dealers. A hearing on the motion that began Thursday with the testimony of about a dozen dealers is scheduled to continue Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) with arguments. U.S. Judge Arthur Gonzalez is expected to rule after arguments conclude. Chrysler LLC flew through five weeks of bankruptcy proceedings and appeared all but certain to be able to complete the sale of its assets to Fiat Group SpA before a June 15 deadline. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a stay Monday in order to review an appeal by a trio of Indiana pension and construction funds which own a small part of Chrysler's secured debt and are opposed to the sale. It is not clear how long the stay will last or if the high court will take up the case. Fiat could walk away from the deal after June 15 and leave the struggling U.S. automaker with little option but to liquidate. Chrysler, which is losing $100 million every day its plants are closed, said it had no comment until it receives further information from the court. A federal appeals court in New York approved the sale Friday, but gave opponents until 4 p.m. Monday to try to get the high court to intervene. Ginsburg issued her one-sentence order minutes before the deadline. The delay may be only temporary. Ginsburg could decide on her own whether to end the stay, or she could ask the full court to decide. Chrysler's ability to speed through the process has partially been a result of the involvement of the Obama administration's auto task force, which provided $4.5 billion in bankruptcy financing and helped negotiate a deal between the company's stakeholders. Under a deal brokered in the days leading up to Chrysler's April 30 bankruptcy protection filing, Fiat will receive up to a 35 percent stake in the new company created by the sale, in exchange for sharing the technology Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler needs to create smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The United Auto Workers union will get a 55 percent stake that will be used to fund its retiree health care obligations, while the U.S. and Canadian governments will receive a combined 10 percent stake. Meanwhile, the automaker's secured debtholders would get $2 billion in cash, or about 29 cents on the dollar, for their combined $6.9 billion in debt. Some of the debtholders balked at the deal, saying as secured lenders they deserved more. A group of investment firms that held about 4 percent of Chrysler's secured debt filed an objection to the sale shortly after the automaker's bankruptcy protection filing, but the group later dissolved, saying it did not have enough members to mount an effective challenge. Later on, the Indiana funds, represented by the same law firm as the dissident debtholders, filed their own objection and eventually appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. They claim the sale unfairly favors Chrysler's unsecured stakeholders such as the union ahead of secured debtholders like themselves. The funds also are challenging the constitutionality of the Treasury Department's use of money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to supply Chrysler's bankruptcy protection financing. They say the government did so without congressional authority. The funds hold about $42.5 million, or less than 1 percent, of Chrysler's $6.9 billion in secured debt. They bought it in July 2008 for 43 cents on the dollar. Consumer groups and individuals with product-related lawsuits also are contesting a condition of the Chrysler sale that would release the company from product liability claims related to vehicles it sold before the asset sale to Fiat. Compensation for such claims would have to be sought from the parts of the company not being sold to Fiat. But those assets have limited value and it is doubtful that there will be anything available to pay out. The appeals come as Congress scrutinizes the Obama administration's restructuring of Chrysler and General Motors Corp. The Senate Banking Committee said it planned to call Ron Bloom, a senior adviser to the auto task force, and Edward Montgomery, who serves as the Obama administration's director of recovery for auto communities and workers, to a hearing Wednesday. Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, the committee's chairman, planned to review the use of TARP funds to help the auto companies and look at whether taxpayers will receive a return on their investment. GM and Chrysler executives faced questions last week from Congress over the elimination of hundreds of dealerships as part of the companies' reorganizations. ------ Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Ken Thomas in Washington and AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report.

1,"Israel wants to build a nuclear power plant, Israeli officials said Tuesday, a move that could bring new attention to the country's secretive nuclear activities. Israel's national infrastructure minister, Uzi Landau, was to publicly announce the idea Tuesday at an international nuclear energy conference in Paris. 'Building a nuclear reactor to produce electricity will allow Israel to achieve energy independence and end its dependence on others,' Landau said in a statement. 'Nuclear technology has many applications that can serve the goal of peace and cooperation.' Israel currently uses coal and natural gas to produce electricity. Landau met several months ago with the French minister in charge of energy, Jean-Louis Borloo, and raised the idea of French-Israeli-Jordanian cooperation in developing a nuclear power plant. The French minister was enthusiastic about the idea, Landau said. It was France which, beginning in the 1950s, helped Israel build its nuclear reactor at Dimona. Israel is believed to have used that reactor to construct a stockpile of nuclear weapons. Israel has never acknowledged being a nuclear power, following a policy it calls 'nuclear ambiguity.' Israel also has a smaller nuclear reactor for research at Nahal Soreq, not far from the country's population center in Tel Aviv. Landau's office says no specific plans to set up a third nuclear power plant have been drawn up so far. The construction of a nuclear reactor could draw international attention to Israel's nuclear activities. Asked if Israel would allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to supervise any new project, Chen Ben Lulu, an aide to Landau, said only that Israel would follow all the relevant rules. Israel has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims to limit the number of countries capable of developing nuclear weapons. The idea of generating nuclear energy has been floating around for years. In 2007, one of Landau's predecessors in the National Infrastructure Ministry, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, said he was working on a plan to build a nuclear power plant in Israel's southern Negev desert. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON _ It's good news that the Obama administration will seek reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. Also welcome is its interest in fixing some of the law's failings, such as the fact that states have been able to game the system with low standards. It's critical, though, that in seeking to repair the law's imperfections, the administration not retreat from its most important legacy: that schools be accountable for their students' achievement. Outlines of the administration's plan concerning NCLB, also known as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, were included in the fiscal 2011 budget proposal released Monday. Two big changes _ both controversial _ are sought: revamping the yardstick used to measure schools' progress, and shifting to doling out federal funds based on competition and performance rather than by formula. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said details of the proposal are still being worked out. Much attention is focused on what would replace the 'adequate yearly progress' standard that requires schools to test students in English and math. The current system can produce warped results; it would be an improvement to measure how much students progress each year rather than just taking snapshots of a given grade's performance. It's encouraging that Duncan is advocating higher standards. But the administration's commitment not to turn the clock back on reform can't be judged until the specifics of its plan are known. We are particularly interested in how it will get school systems to do a better job of delivering on the promise that students most in need will get the teachers most able to help them. It also will be tricky to ensure that an attempt to bring more flexibility to measurements doesn't provide a way to dodge true accountability. Duncan has demonstrated a refreshing willingness to stand up for teacher performance pay and charter schools. So, like many others who see more good than bad in NCLB, we're waiting to see if the administration comes up with legislation that is as tough as its words. "
1,"ACME, Mich. - General Motors Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre said Thursday that while an initial public offering filing isn't likely in the next few weeks, he is eager for the government to sell its shares to investors. GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is preparing to file a registration statement for an IPO this month so the stock sale could be held by November, people familiar with the matter have said. When asked today whether he expects a filing within a couple of weeks, he replied: 'No, I don't.' Whitacre said it could be the biggest IPO ever. The automaker is 61 percent owned by the federal government, which would sell a fifth of its stake in the initial offering and reduce its ownership to less than half, people said. Cutting or eliminating the government's stake will help with employee morale and sales, Whitacre said. 'We don't like this label of Government Motors,' he said in a question-and- answer session after his speech, which closed a four-day automotive conference in Acme, Mich. 'We know it turns off customers. It turns us off.' Whitacre told reporters Thursday that it doesn't matter whether the IPO is held before the mid-term elections Nov. 2. 'I don't think that's really a factor,' he said. 'Everybody would like to make it that, but I don't think that's really a factor.' Steve Girsky, a GM vice chairman, declined to comment on whether GM could still hold an IPO this year. 'There are factors that go into this, one of which is our performance, the other of which is the market performance,' he said. 'One of which we control, the other of which we don't.' In May, GM reported first-quarter net income of $865 million, helped by higher production and smaller discounts. Whitacre said second-quarter results will be 'impressive.' 'If you liked our first-quarter earnings, stay tuned for our results next week,' he said in the speech. Whitacre was making his first appearance at the Center for Automotive Research's annual conference. He repeated a theme this week that the auto industry had come a long way in a year. Separately, GM said Thursday it has concluded the dealer arbitration process and that it will have a network of about 4,500 U.S. dealerships by Nov 1. In June 2009, GM had 6,049 dealerships selling eight brands. A successful IPO for GM, which would be the second in half a century after Tesla Motors Inc.'s offering in June, would gauge the market's interest in auto- related companies, said John Corey, chief executive officer of Stoneridge Inc., a Warren, Ohio-based supplier of electrical components for cars, trucks and farm equipment. Corey is chairman of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a Troy, Mich.-based trade group. 'I hope GM has a successful IPO because it shows people are willing to lend back into the industry,' he said. 'We have to demonstrate we can return our cost of capital, that we can return investment to the shareholders.' "
1,"The dollar's ascent against the euro may be stifling Russian efforts to challenge the greenback's dominance as a reserve currency, with policy makers in Moscow allowing the dollar's share of foreign reserves to swell. Russia's central bank 'changed the currency structure of reserves,' raising the U.S. currency's share by 3 percentage points to 44.5 percent, BNP Paribas said Tuesday, citing Bank Rossii numbers on the final months of last year. The euro's portion fell 3.7 points to 43.8 percent. The figures, part of the central bank's annual report to parliament, aren't official yet, said a Bank Rossii spokesman who declined to be identified, citing bank policy. It's 'very much a case of economic rationalism trumping bellicose politics,' said Neil Shearing, a London-based emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, in an e- mailed response to questions. 'With the euro likely to fall further over the coming quarters and a general retreat to safe havens likely to boost the dollar, expect more of the same.' The euro has dropped 18 percent against the dollar since Nov. 25 on investor concern that policy makers may fail to contain Europe's debt crisis. Central banks have probably lost $300 billion this year on the euro and may consider cutting holdings of the currency, Stephen Jen, a managing director at hedge fund BlueGold Capital Management , said earlier this month. The dollar's share in Russian reserves will probably account for '50 percent, maybe more' of the total by the end of this year, said Julia Tsepliaeva, head of research at BNP Paribas in Moscow, in a phone interview. 'We must be prepared for changes to the allocation of various currencies on the market because the global situation isn't very stable,' Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina told reporters in Moscow Thursday. The central bank has a 'sensible currency diversification,' she said. 'I don't think substantial changes need to be made here.' Russian policy makers have been devising alternatives since the credit crisis erupted that would allow the world's biggest energy supplier to reduce its reliance on the dollar. Officials in Moscow have been backed by Brazil, India and China seeking to limit the dollar's dominance in the $8.36 trillion of global reserves. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has pushed for the creation of regional reserve currencies and in July produced a prototype coin for a 'world currency,' which he said was needed to stabilize the global economy. 'Common sense tells you that Russia's rhetoric doesn't always correspond to reality,' said Nikolai Kashcheev, head of research at the treasury department of Moscow-based OAO Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender. 'What we are seeing now is the central bank trying to balance reserves after skewing them toward euros.' A euro decline to $1.2150 would wipe out gains from reserve managers' efforts to diversify away from the dollar into the European currency, Jen wrote earlier this month. China may have lost $80 billion and Russia $14 billion, according to that note. The euro traded as low as $1.2144 Wednesday. Arkady Dvorkovich, an adviser to Medvedev, said last week that it would be 'absolutely incorrect' to assume the central bank had suffered losses on the scale suggested by Jen and said returns must be calculated over a longer timeframe. Dvorkovich told reporters in Moscow today the euro area economy may stagnate for months or even years. Growth will be 'very slow or even zero,' he said. 'It will be a very difficult time.'

1,"Ford, boosting its factory investments without new hiring, is spending $155 million at a Cleveland engine plant and creating 60 positions to be filled by workers being laid off elsewhere later this year. Production will start next month on a new V-6 engine for the 2011 Mustang, a Ford spokeswoman, Marcey Evans, said in an interview. Ford has cut its North American workforce 47 percent since 2006. Ford is spending $1.8 billion overhauling six engine and transmission plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Bringing back furloughed hourly employees or shuffling them among factories helps the automaker hold down labor costs. 'If sales volume goes up and they don't hire, they will become extremely profitable,' said Van Conway, senior managing director of restructuring firm Conway MacKenzie in Birmingham, Mich. 'If volumes go up 10 percent, there will not be 10 percent more people hired. It will be closer to zero.' The 1,260 jobs being added at the engine and transmission factories getting the new investment will go to workers on layoff or being brought from other sites, Evans said. Those coming to the Cleveland engine plant are among those to be laid off when Ford shuts a nearby castings factory, eliminating 700 jobs, she said. Ford is still retrenching as it recovers from $30 billion in losses from 2006 to 2008. The second-largest U.S. automaker had net income of $2.7 billion in 2009, when the predecessors of General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. Ford has 600 workers on indefinite layoff. It is cutting a shift of 900 workers in July from a Michigan Mustang factory. Ford has 41,000 U.S. hourly workers. 'We have not started new hiring yet,' Evans said. 'But in each instance, these are new jobs to that facility to support production of that new product.' Hiring new workers would help Ford close its gap in hourly labor costs with Toyota Motor Corp. Hourly compensation for U.S. workers including wages and benefits averages about $55 at Ford, compared with $50 at Toyota. Ford's United Auto Workers contract lets the automaker give fewer benefits to new hires and pay them about $14 an hour, half as much as current employees. In addition to Cleveland, Ford is adding new engines at factories in Romeo, Mich.; Chihuahua, Mexico; and Windsor, Ontario, Evans said. It is starting new transmission production at plants in Sharonville, Ohio, and Livonia, Mich., she said. Previously, the Mustang's V-6 engine was made in Germany. The engines and transmissions will power the 2011 Mustang and Super Duty Ford F-series pickup truck, which go on sale in the first half of this year, Evans said. They are among nine new, more fuel-efficient engines or transmissions for 2011 Ford models, she said. "
1,"WASHINGTON -- Electronic cigarettes are pitting regulators against some anti- smoking forces over whether to allow sales now and accelerate smoking-cessation efforts or suspend sales until their true safety and effectiveness can be proven. Proponents of the battery-powered devices urge the Food and Drug Administration to consider them a tool for smokers seeking a tobacco-free alternative. The American Lung Association wants them banned unless proven in clinical drug trials. 'The tobacco-control community is kind of split' on e- cigarettes, Kenneth Warner, dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said in an interview. 'Some people are convinced that anything that has any kind of nicotine or tobacco in it must be subject to the FDA's review and approval. Others think it's almost certainly less harmful than cigarettes.' The FDA is appealing a U.S. District Court ruling that the agency lacks authority to regulate the devices as drugs because they are recreational, not therapeutic. Potential users spend $1.2 billion on smoking-cessation products and $80 billion on cigarettes a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA said e-cigarettes may work with smokers the way methadone clinics wean heroin addicts by giving them a less harmful form of an addictive substance. Most e-cigarettes deliver a flavored, nicotine-filled vapor -- and are sold with starter kits containing atomizers, batteries and cartridges. They are available online starting at about $40. The agency said it has blocked imports of more than 800 e-cigarette shipments since 2008, most from China. 'While nicotine seems to be the primary ingredient in the cartridges, it is simply unknown how many other chemicals are present and in what amounts,' Siobhan DeLancey, an agency spokeswoman, said by e-mail. A 2009 FDA analysis found some nicotine levels exceeded amounts specified in labels, she said. E-cigarette demand is getting a boost from celebrity users like actress Katherine Heigl as well as Internet availability. Heigl puffed on one during an appearance in September on CBS's 'Late Show,' telling host David Letterman the cigarette wasn't harmful. SmokeStik International Inc., the producer of Heigl's e- cigarette, posted a disclaimer on its website after the appearance saying the company doesn't make health or safety claims. The FDA can regulate as drugs cigarette alternatives that carry therapeutic claims, according to the ruling. The U.S. e-cigarette market consists of several dozen closely held companies including Toronto-based SmokeStik, which hasn't received FDA warnings and doesn't market products as smoking-cessation devices. FDA officials warned five companies in September they were making improper health claims. Las Vegas-based E-Cig Technology Inc. violated agency rules by saying on its website that e- cigarettes can 'help you reduce or quit smoking habits,' the agency said in a letter in September. Warning letters were sent to Gamucci America, a unit of Smokey Bayou Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.; Ruyan America Inc. in Minneapolis; Johnson Creek Enterprises in Johnson Creek, Wis.; and E-CigaretteDirect in Parker, Colo. Ruyan America hasn't sold products containing nicotine in the U.S. since May 2009, the company's president, said Bill Bartkowski. E-Cig Technology, Johnson Creek and E-CigaretteDirect didn't respond to e-mails sent through websites, while Smokey Bayou didn't reply to a voicemail left at a listed phone number. E-cigarettes need the same FDA drug review as nicotine gum, patches and other approved cessation aids, said Howard Marsh, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health- care division. Glaxo's Nicorette was the top-selling brand-name drug for nicotine replacement in the year through June, with $144.6 million in sales, or 12 percent of the smoking-cessation market, based on data from IMS Health Inc., a research firm in Norwalk, Conn. 'You've got to be fair to consumers,' Marsh said in an interview. 'They need the reassurance that these products have undergone the same degree of rigor in terms of demonstrating safety and efficacy.' Unless e-cigarette companies can prove the gadgets are safe, 'people should not use them because we don't know what they are,' said Paul Billings, vice president of national policy and advocacy at the American Lung Association in Washington. For Elaine Keller, an e-cigarette user and vice president of the nonprofit Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, the potential for risk is worth the benefit. 'Maybe it's not 100 percent safe, but it certainly is safer,' she said. "
1,"Imagine yourself in the atrium lobby of a hotel with soaring wood-beamed ceilings, a massive stone fireplace and a bar tucked off just to the side. Then imagine rooms that, at 500 square feet, are bigger than some New York City apartments, with fireplaces, seating areas, fridges and microwaves. Move on to the hotel spa, complete with hot stone massages, green facials and soothing music. Next, hit the hot tub that, at 381 square feet, is virtually guaranteed to be the largest you've ever soaked your troubles away in. Where is this perfect haven for a grown-up getaway? Great Wolf Lodge. No, you didn't misread, and I didn't mistype. That indoor water park behemoth outside Williamsburg, whose name is so often uttered with the world-weary sigh of parents who are 'doing it for the kids,' has a lot to offer adults - with and without offspring. Let's face it, the 12-resort chain bills itself as 'family friendly.' That means kids roaming the hallways, waving wands at dragons as they complete tasks on 'MagiQuest,' a Harry Potter-esque interactive adventure. And while many of the littler darlings have Mom or Dad in tow, what's remarkable is the number of tweens and teens, traveling in groups sans adults, who are on the prowl - in the hallways, at the water park, in the arcade or the video-game room. Great Wolf spokeswoman Angie Amberg says the majority of the kids who come to the park are between ages 4 and 12, but with an arcade full of games including Fast and Furious, Terminator Salvation, Superbikes and Dance Dance Revolution, it would be easy to characterize the place as 12-year-old nirvana. All of which means that the parents of these kids can take a seat around the ample bar - and on a recent Saturday night, that's where more than a dozen were. Or they can share a glass of wine at a table overlooking the water park. Or just stay in their room, in front of the fire - with a good book, of course. Great Wolf offers kids the opportunity for a little independence and parents the assurance that they're risking little by giving the kids that independence. 'It just feels very safe and contained,' said Jennifer Foster, who had brought her 14-year-old son and a friend. 'I feel comfortable letting them go off by themselves.' Adding to that sense of security is the fact that, unlike some other resorts, Great Wolf allows only hotel guests to use the water park. It offers the sense - not unlike a cruise ship - of being part of a self-contained society. But Great Wolf also proves itself as a destination for those who want to embrace their inner child, even without children of their own. A group of five 40-something women chatting away in the cavernous adults-only hot tub during a recent weekend giddily share their secret. 'We're here on a girls' weekend to celebrate our friend who is becoming a first-time bride in February,' says Janet Yandle, a teacher from Chester, Va. She points over at the not-quite-blushing bride, Pam Klein, who describes the place as 'awesome' as she dangles her feet in 100-plus degree water. So what's the appeal for this group of four teachers and a nurse? 'It's nice to have kids nearby without having to yell at them,' Yandle says quickly, before adding: 'It feels like you've really gotten away from everything.' Fellow teacher Sue Brown is a repeat Great Wolf Lodger. 'I've been to a lot of spas, and the one here is as nice as any,' she says. 'It's as peaceful in there as it is wild out here.' And she points to the massive, always 84-degree complex that is home to a wave pool, a dumping bucket, a lazy river and slides of varying thrill levels. 'We ought to be ashamed of ourselves,' she laughs, before mentioning that she can't wait to ride the Howling Tornado, the six-story-high funnel ride that is the resort's signature destination for the over 48-inch set. The lines for the Tornado, River Canyon Run and some of the other more extreme slides are dominated by the tween and teen crowd. Sure, there's the occasional dad or mom pretending to chaperone offspring but really there only to relive the glee that inevitably accompanies a rubber tube, an unexpected stomach-lurching drop and the spray of cold water in the face. But just as easily, Mom can opt to grab an inner tube and be gently tossed in the wave pool while teenage sons make their way up the four-story Fort McKenzie to find the perfect perch from which to dump buckets of water on unsuspecting - but delighted - guests below. All this comes at a price: Rooms and suites range from about $200 to more than $400 a night (though that includes water park admission). So the question becomes: What price to put on a getaway weekend that elicits squeals of joy from the kids and ahhs of relaxation from the adults? In a word: priceless. "
1,"Sarah Palin will campaign in Minneapolis on Wednesday alongside Rep. Michelle Bachmann, R-Minn., bringing together perhaps the two most influential Republican women in the country for the first time since each played a leading role in rallying conservative opposition to President Obama's health-care proposal. Republicans in the state gave out 10,000 tickets for a downtown rally that will include Palin and Bachmann as well as Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R), who is considering a presidential run in 2012. Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity will host his Fox News show from the event, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The rally, at 3 p.m. Eastern time, could feature some of the most intense criticism of Obama since the 2008 Republican National Convention, which took place in St. Paul. Many Democrats view Bachmann's and Palin's criticism of Obama and his policies as irresponsible and misleading. Palin famously argued last year that the president's health-care plan would create 'death panels,' a claim that has been widely debunked. And Bachmann recently declared, 'I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views and now I look like Nostradamus.' Bachmann, who was well known for controversial comments even before Palin's emergence in the 2008 campaign, has emerged as a de facto 'tea party' congresswoman, helping organize and then speak at several of the activist network's recent rallies in Washington. But her role in the tea party movement and her aggressive criticism of Obama during frequent appearances on FOX News have made Bachmann a particular target for Democrats, who are seeking her defeat in this fall's elections. State Sen. Tarryl Clark, a Democrat, has raised more than $1 million in her race against Bachmann, a high total for a non-incumbent so early in the election cycle. Bachmann has raised more than $1.5 million, more than all but four House Republican candidates, aided by thousands of dollars in small donations from conservatives outside of the state. Her appearance at a fundraiser following the rally with Palin could help with bigger contributions; donors who give $10,000 (the first $4,800, the legal limit, goes to Bachmann, the rest to the state party) get a picture with Palin. Democrats say the event will combine two of the most dishonest voices in politics. 'One says that President Obama is trying to force America's youth into re- education camps. The other insists that health-insurance reform will create government-sponsored `death panels,' ' Congressional Democrats said in a message to supporters about Wednesday's event. 'The outrageous lies by Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin have become the stuff of legend.' The rally comes in the midst of a political comeback for Bachmann, who was first elected to Congress in 2006. In October 2008, Democrats sharply attacked the Minnesota lawmaker, and some Republicans distanced themselves from her after she said of Obama, 'I am very concerned that he may have anti-American views.' Democrats quickly organized to defeat her, donating more than $1 million to her opponent in four days. In a conservative district McCain won by eight points, Bachmann collected only 46 percent of the vote, winning a three-way race by just three points. Some GOP leaders are still privately wary of Bachmann and are not eager for her to take a high-profile official leadership role in the party. She has over the past year referred to 'gangster government' under Obama and said an idea Democrats were considering to pass health-care legislation sounded 'like a Chavez tactic in Venezuela.' But she cemented her place in the center of the conservative movement by personally calling for activists to come to Washington in November for an impromptu health-care event that turned a huge rally on Capitol Hill. Party leaders felt compelled to attend what she dubbed the 'Super Bowl of Freedom.' 'Representative Bachmann is looked to by many in conservatives as the Sarah Palin of Capitol Hill,' said Ron Bonjean, a former top GOP aide on Capitol Hill. 'She has demonstrated a unique ability to connect with and fire up tea party groups, especially during the health-care debate.' "
1,"Yale University, the third-oldest U.S. college, has agreed to return Incan artifacts taken from Peru a century ago, President Alan Garcia said. Ernesto Zedillo, a Yale professor and a former Mexican president, promised yesterday to return the artifacts, which were excavated by archaeologist and Yale Professor Hiram Bingham from the Machu Picchu citadel in the southern Andes in 1912, Garcia said in statement dated yesterday and posted on the presidential website. 'The Peruvian government welcomes this decision and recognizes that Yale University preserved the pieces that otherwise would have been scattered around the world in private collections or might have disappeared,' Garcia said. Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Peru will insist the items, which include bronze knives, silver jewelry and fragmented pottery, are returned starting in the first quarter, Garcia said. They will be kept at San Antonio Abad University in the southern Andean city of in Cuzco, where Yale researchers will be able to keep studying them, he said. The government began seeking the pieces in the early 2000s. Yale said in 2008 it was seeking 'an amicable resolution that would ensure the continued conservation and scholarly study of the historic collection.' Earlier this month, Garcia said the Peruvian government may sue to force the Ivy League school to return the artifacts. Machu Picchu was built by Inca emperor Pachacutec in the mid-15th century, at the height of the empire. The stone citadel, which lies at an altitude of almost 8,000 feet, overlooks a forest 345 miles southeast of Lima. Machu Picchu is Peru's top tourist attraction, receiving about 850,000 visitors per year. It will be the site of centennial celebrations next year to commemorate the lost city's rediscovery by Bingham in 1911. "
1,"Oil prices fell below $82 a barrel Friday as traders remained cautious ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting and U.S. midterm elections. By early afternoon in Europe, benchmark oil for December delivery was down 54 cents to $81.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added 24 cents to settle at $82.18 on Thursday. Crude has loitered near $82 this week, matching bobbing stock and currency markets, as traders wait to see how big the Fed's Treasury bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, will be to help spur economic growth. 'The price of oil is still moving sideways around the $82 a barrel mark,' said analysts at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. 'The physical oversupply is preventing another rise toward $85 and the interest of financial investors is stopping prices from falling below $80.' Commodities have gained in recent weeks in anticipation the Fed measures will undermine the dollar further and make dollar-based assets cheaper for investors with other currencies. But the Fed must temper its desire to boost the economy with concern that higher commodity prices would spark inflation and eat away at corporate profits. 'Too aggressive a course of quantitative easing would launch commodities prices ever higher,' Cameron Hanover said in a report. 'Corporate profits had been one of the bright spots in an otherwise anemic economic recovery.' 'Almost everything depends on what the Fed does next Wednesday.' Traders will also be closely watching Friday reports about U.S. economic growth, consumer sentiment and manufacturing. Some analysts expect the Fed's move will push oil prices higher despite sluggish U.S. demand. Citigroup raised its three-month forecast to $85 from $74 and its 12-month estimate to $90 from $83. 'The prospect of quantitative easing, and the associated risk rally and dollar weakness, should support prices despite the downward pressure instigated by very high U.S. inventories,' Citigroup said. In other Nymex trading in November contracts, heating oil fell 0.96 cent to $2.2339 a gallon and gasoline dropped 0.67 cent to $2.1072 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4.6 cents to $3.936 per 1,000 cubic feet. In London, Brent crude fell 36 cents to $83.23 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. ------ Associated Press writer "
1,"The pitched battle over health-care reform has unleashed a rash of political vandalism and attacks, with at least 10 Democratic members of Congress reporting death threats, incidents of harassment or vandalism at their district offices over the past week. More than 100 House Democrats met behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon with the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police. The lawmakers voiced what one senior aide who was present described as 'serious concern' about their security in Washington and in their home districts when they return this weekend for spring recess. Usually only members in leadership positions have regular personal protection by the Capitol Police. But at least 10 members have been offered increased protection by law enforcement agencies, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. Asked if members are endangered, Hoyer said: 'Yes. (There are) very serious incidents that have occurred.' Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer e-mailed senators and staffers Wednesday telling them to 'remain vigilant.' He said in an interview that the warning was meant to 'assuage people's fears.' Despite the incidents involving House members, Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief, said there have been no reported incidents involving senators. Still, the violence has unnerved House Democrats. 'Our democracy is about participation,' Hoyer said. 'Our democracy is about differing and debate and animated debate and passionate debate. But it is not about violence.' The vandalism began last weekend, when the House debated the health bill for final passage. In Wichita, Kan., someone broke the window of a storefront county Democratic Party headquarters with a brick that had 'No to Obama' and 'No ObamyCare' written on it. Lyndsey Stauble, executive director of the Sedgwick County Democratic Party, said she came to work Saturday morning to clean up the shattered glass strewn about her desk. 'It was surprising and alarming to know that people, when they have so many opportunities for expression in this country, that somebody would resort to a brick,' Stauble said. Over the next 24 hours, thrown bricks shattered the glass doors and windows of party headquarters from Rochester, N.Y., to Cincinnati. A gas line at the Charlottesville, Va., home of the brother of Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Va., was severed Tuesday after a self-identified 'tea party' activist posted what he believed to be the Virginia Democrat's address on a Web site and urged opponents to 'drop by' to convey their opposition to his yes vote on health care. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., had a brick thrown through her Niagara Falls district office and received a threatening voicemail referencing sniper attacks. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., had the front door to her Tucson district office shattered. And Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., whose last-minute negotiations to bar federal funding of abortion helped secure the bill's passage, received a fax with a drawing of a noose and an anonymous voicemail saying, 'You're dead. We know where you live. We'll get you.' In Washington on Wednesday, the attacks were roundly condemned, with some congressional leaders wondering whether the long fight over health-care reform had unleashed an ugly dimension to the modern political discourse. 'If we fail to learn the lessons of our history, we are bound to repeat them,' House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., said. 'I think all of us learned some great lessons from the '60s and '70s, and there are some lessons that none of us want to repeat, but one thing we know, as Steny Hoyer said, `Silence is consent.' ' House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the violence is unacceptable. 'I know many Americans are angry over this health-care bill, and that Washington Democrats just aren't listening,' Boehner told Fox News Channel. 'But, as I've said, violence and threats are unacceptable. That's not the American way. We need to take that anger and channel it into positive change. Call your congressman, go out and register people to vote, go volunteer on a political campaign, make your voice heard _ but let's do it the right way.' Some Democrats, sensing a political opportunity, suggested that Republicans were fanning the violence with their fiery comments in recent days. Several GOP lawmakers stood on the speaker's balcony at the Capitol overlooking a tea party protest last weekend holding up signs that read 'Kill the Bill.' Below them, protesters were yelling 'No! No! No!' and 'Nancy, you will burn in hell for this!' One of the more threatening incidents involved Perriello, whose older brother, Bo, came home on Tuesday and smelled gas in the house. He discovered that a line to a propane tank on a gas grill in his yard had been cut. A threatening letter was also sent to the home that day. Federal and local authorities were investigating the incident. 'While it is too early to say anything definitive regarding political motivations behind this act, it's never too early for political leaders to condemn threats of violence, particularly as threats to other members of Congress and their children escalate,' Perriello, a freshman who faces a tough reelection fight, said in a statement. 'And so I ask every member of House and Senate leadership to state unequivocally tonight that it is never OK to harm or threaten elected officials and their families with anything more than political retribution. Here in America, we settle our political differences at the ballot box.' Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, both Republicans, condemned the vandalism and threats. Cuccinelli, who has become a conservative folk hero for filing suit over the health-care bill, said the severing of the gas line was 'absolutely, totally unacceptable' and that posting Perriello's address online was 'way over the line.' Some of the violence appears to have been instigated by an Alabama blogger, Mike Vanderboegh, who encouraged his readers to throw bricks at the windows of Democratic headquarters across the country. Vanderboegh, a former leader of the Alabama Constitutional Militia who is headlining an open-carry gun rally in Northern Virginia next month, issued a call to the modern 'Sons of Liberty' on his libertarian political blog to break windows nationwide to display opposition to health-care reform. A vandal threw a brick into the glass doors at the Monroe County Democratic Committee's headquarters in Rochester overnight Saturday, attaching a note that quoted Barry Goldwater: 'Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.' Vanderboegh did not respond to questions Wednesday from The Washington Post, but he took credit for the incident in an interview earlier this week with The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 'I guess that guy's one of ours,' he told the newspaper. 'Glad to know people read my blog.' -0-< Staff writers Ann Gerhart, Paul Kane, Anita Kumar and Rosalind S.

1,"A century and a half later, Americans still don't know quite what to think of John Brown, a fervent abolitionist who launched a bloody attack meant to take down slavery. Certainly, he aimed to be a hero. He believed his plan was the necessary means to a righteous end: Storm a federal arsenal, seize thousands of weapons, arm a gathering guerrilla force and start the revolution that would end the morally reprehensible but perfectly legal institution. Yet the first casualty of his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry was a free black man, a baggage handler who bled to death on the street while Brown's raiders grabbed hostages and holed up at a fire engine house. Within 48 hours, Brown's rebellion was dead, along with at least four civilians, 10 raiders and a U.S. Marine who helped retake the building. Brown's methods have been debated ever since, the grandiosity of his plot and his willingness to kill or be killed a timeless fascination. This year, the National Park Service has declared that his raid was the opening salvo in the country's brutal Civil War, with sesquicentennial commemorations beginning in West Virginia. But in 1959, as America began to contemplate the centennial of the War Between the States, Brown was largely left out of the discussion. Segregation of schools and public lynchings still made headlines that year, and many white Southerners feared civil rights activists would use tales of the raid to agitate. Blacks feared being marginalized, or worse. And so John Brown was pushed aside. 'John Brown was, in effect, a terrorist. Whether you agree that what he was doing was right or not,' says Gerry Gaumer, spokesman for the Park Service in Washington, D.C. 'There are people in the Taliban who believe what they're doing is right. Can you separate John Brown from what's going on in Iraq or Iran or Pakistan or Afghanistan? 'They fervently believe what they're doing is right,' he says. 'But is there a better way?' This month, the Park Service is offering walking tours that retrace Brown's footsteps through the picturesque town at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. Descendants of raiders, soldiers and townspeople will gather in August, then return for the Oct. 16 anniversary to explain their ancestors' roles. Had his own been among the bodies in 1859, Brown might have remained a bit player in the larger drama of the war. But that was not his fate. On trial for treason, murder and inciting a rebellion, he refused to apologize and declared the fight for freedom sanctioned by God and the Bible. Swiftly convicted and executed, he became a potent and enduring symbol -- to the North, a heroic martyr willing to die for equality; to the South, a lunatic killer attacking a way of life. And so he remained for a century or more, a complicated man often dismissed with simplistic labels. Later, people began to talk more openly about slavery and the roles that blacks and other racial and social groups had played in the nation's defining conflict. Slowly, says historian Jean Libby, historians stopped dismissing Brown as a madman and began to put him in the context of his times, times when -- to the undying outrage of Brown and his wealthy supporters -- courts ruled that black people were not citizens but property of whites. Textbook writers, Libby says, gradually began to acknowledge that slaves had come from Africa with culture and history of their own, in need of neither handlers nor teachers. 'Now slavery is portrayed differently,' she says, 'and so is John Brown.' Brown, a Connecticut native, had despised slavery since he was a boy and witnessed a slave being beaten. He spent months plotting to seize 100,000 weapons in what was then Virginia, retreat into the mountains and begin a guerrilla war with slaves who would join him, emboldened by his success. 'He was so ahead of his time,' says Alice Keesey Mecoy, who discovered she was Brown's great-great-great granddaughter in 1976. Libby had come to Mecoy's grandmother, asking to photograph the family. Mecoy found the story 'kind of cool,' but she was 16. Only after her own children had left home did she grow so interested as to make her ancestor's life her full-time research project. This fall, the 49-year-old former accountant and office manager from Allen, Texas, is presenting a paper in Harpers Ferry on the women surrounding Brown. A book is in the works. 'He wasn't only against slavery. He was for equality of all people, men and women, any color, any religion. He firmly felt everyone was equal,' she says. 'And that was such a radical thought for the time.' Brown became part of the popular culture of his times, and that legacy endures: An American reggae band uses the song as its name and Brown's likeness on its album covers. In 2007, a rare daguerreotype of Brown sold for $97,750 at a Cincinnati auction. While many defend Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry, few label the slaughter of five pro-slavery leaders in Kansas three years before as anything but premeditated murder. Brown's raiding party on Pottawatomie Creek hacked the men to death with swords in an execution that University of Maryland professor Martin Gordon calls 'probably the most misunderstood event of his career.' 'Why did he use swords? Not because he's a barbarian, but because he didn't want anyone to hear what he was doing. Rifle fire would wake up the town' says Gordon, president of the Council of America's Military Past. 'This was a very selective act of terrorism, moral justice, take your pick. Criminal action, take your pick,' Gordon says. 'But he wanted to teach the pro-slavery element in Kansas a lesson, so he picked five of their leaders, pulled them out of their house and killed them as silently as he could.' In his own death, Brown became what the pro-slavery New York Journal of Commerce predicted when it published an editorial urging that he be imprisoned rather than hanged for his crimes. 'Monsters are hydra-headed, and decapitation only quickens vitality, and power of reproduction,' the newspaper warned. Escaped slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had tried to talk Brown out of his doomed raid, acknowledged its importance decades later, in an 1881 speech in Harpers Ferry. 'Until this blow was struck, the prospect for freedom was dim, shadowy and uncertain. The irrepressible conflict was one of words, votes and compromises,' he said. 'When John Brown stretched forth his arm the sky was cleared. The time for compromises was gone -- the armed hosts of freedom stood face to face over the chasm of a broken Union -- and the clash of arms was at hand.' ------ On the Web: Harpers Ferry National Historical Park: http://www.nps.gov/hafe/historyculture/john-brown.htm The Kennedy Farmhouse: http://www.johnbrown.org/story.htm Quad-State Sesquicentennial Committee: http://www.johnbrownraid.org/index.php "
1,"Real Madrid finalized a deal to hire Jose Mourinho as coach Friday after reaching an agreement on compensation with Inter Milan. The deal was announced after a meeting in Milan between Madrid president Florentino Perez and Inter counterpart Massimo Moratti. Real Madrid said Mourinho will be officially introduced on Monday at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. He replaces Manuel Pelligrini, who was fired on Wednesday. Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport said Madrid will pay euro16 million ($19 million) in compensation in two installments. Mourinho confirmed he wanted to join Madrid after Inter beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in the Spanish capital last Saturday to win the Champions League. In two years with Inter, Mourinho led the club to two league titles, one Italian cup and its first European Cup since 1965. Before that, he led Chelsea to two Premier League titles. He also won the Champions League with Porto in 2004. Despite having won nine European Cups, Madrid's last Champions League triumph came in 2002. Last summer, Madrid spent large fees on Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema. But the team failed to progress past the first knockout round of the Champions League. "
1,"CBS's Showtime is developing an online video service for subscribers, according to a person with knowledge of the plans, joining rival cable channels that are seeking to reach customers away from TV sets. The service would be similar to the Web access being tested by Time Warner's HBO, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren't public. Showtime, with 18 million pay-TV subscribers and original shows including 'Nurse Jackie' and 'Weeds,' hasn't set a starting date. Premium cable channels are experimenting with ways to offer service online and to mobile customers without cannibalizing monthly pay-TV subscription fees that contribute the bulk of their revenue. Showtime is discussing the planned service with pay-TV operators that distribute the channel, the person said. 'There's nothing to announce at this time,' Johanna Fuentes, a spokeswoman for Showtime in New York, said in an interview. HBO, which along with Cinemax has about 40 million subscribers, in February began offering HBO GO at no additional cost to customers on Verizon Communications's FiOS TV service. 'All the HBO subscribers in the United States are going to have HBO programming on demand across every device,' Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's chief executive officer, said on a May 5 conference call. 'That is a powerful offering.' Starz, owned by Liberty Media Corp., provides shows to Netflix, which offers the cable channel's content online as part of its monthly movie-rental subscription plans. Viacom's Epix, the premium movie channel first offered in October 2009, includes online access for all customers. Two- thirds have viewed movies online, with an average age of 36, according to a survey released today by Epix. Epix, also owNed by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., has distribution with pay-TV systems including Dish Network Corp., Verizon's FiOS, Cox Communications and Charter Communications Inc.

1,"The interim Honduran government has extended a curfew until Wednesday morning after security forces clashed with supporters of the country's ousted president. Information Minister Rene Zepeda says the measure was taken 'to protect national security.' The government had imposed a 26-hour curfew beginning Monday afternoon, closing businesses and schools and leaving the capital's streets nearly deserted. The new decree extends the curfew until 6 a.m. Wednesday. Baton-wielding soldiers on Tuesday used tear gas and water cannons to chase away thousands who were demonstrating outside the Brazilian embassy, where deposed President Manuel Zelaya is holed up. All the nation's international airports and border posts were closed and roadblocks set up to keep Zelaya supporters from massing for protests. "
1,"WASHINGTON - A three-way race for an open Senate seat in Florida will test the ability of a popular governor running as an independent to overcome Republican and Democratic rivals in a campaign that will help determine which party controls the Senate. Gov. Charlie Crist, who left the Republican Party in the face of a challenge from Marco Rubio, a former state House speaker, must peel votes from his old party as well as from Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek, a black Miami congressman, to win the Senate seat. Florida voters will also choose Crist's successor in a gubernatorial contest between two former business executives: Democrat Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer and onetime president of Bank of America's Florida unit, and Republican Rick Scott, a former head of Columbia HCA Healthcare Corp. Scott spent millions of his own money to beat Attorney General Bill McCollum in Tuesday's Republican primary. Intensive spending and advertising boosted Scott, a political novice, in a bruising primary battle with McCollum, who served for two decades in Congress before running for statewide office. The fractious primary race may benefit Sink, also a relative newcomer after serving one term in public office following a career in banking. In the Senate race, Crist is campaigning as an independent after bolting the Republican Party. Republican Rubio is backed by Tea Party activists. This leaves Meek to court the Democratic base in a swing state where Democrats outnumber Republicans, yet independents often settle election contests. 'I am the real Democrat in this race,' Meek told cheering supporters after he defeated billionaire real-estate investor Jeff Greene. 'I am running against two conservative candidates' and am 'the only candidate who opposed offshore drilling' before the April 20 explosion of BP's oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Rubio, 39, who won the Republican Senate nomination Tuesday, said the country is going the wrong way. 'If you like the direction that America is headed, if you think Washington is doing the right thing, there are two other people on the ballot and you should vote for them,' he told supporters after winning his primary. He promised to 'offer a compelling vision of the future' for the nation. Crist said he was an alternative to candidates 'imprisoned by the parties' that support them. 'If you want somebody who is on the hard right, you have a candidate,' he said on CNN's 'Larry King Live.' 'If you want someone on the hard left you have a candidate.' In an election year that will hinge on voter enthusiasm, the Florida Republican turnout was almost 50 percent higher than that of Democrats. More than 1.2 million Republicans cast ballots in the party's gubernatorial primary compared with about 900,000 in the Democratic Senate primary. 'The enthusiasm gap is evident,' said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. The three candidates are vying to fill the Senate seat vacated last year by the resignation of Mel Martinez, a former Republican National Committee chairman. Crist appointed a former chief of staff, George LeMieux, to fill the vacancy. Crist, 54, who served as a state legislator and Florida attorney general before becoming governor in 2006, dropped out of the Republican Senate primary and filed to run as an independent after polls showed Rubio winning the nomination. Crist was an early supporter of the $816 billion economic- stimulus program that President Barack Obama pushed through Congress last year against broad Republican opposition. He also campaigned against offshore oil drilling after the BP rig explosion in the gulf. 'Crist has come up in the polls running as a Democrat,' MacManus said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. Looking at the general election ahead, Crist led Rubio 39 percent to 32 percent in a Quinnipiac University poll of 1,096 registered voters, with Meek getting 16 percent. The poll conducted Aug. 11-16 had a 3-point error margin. Rubio has tacked to the center to try to appeal to more moderate voters, 'but not on issues that are vital to Republicans' such as cutting government spending and taxes, MacManus said in a telephone interview. 'Debt is a big issue here' and 'has showed up in the polls as a huge driver of how people are thinking about things,' she said. Meek, 39, who served in both Florida's House and Senate, succeeded his mother, former Representative Carrie Meek, with his election to Congress in 2003. Former President Bill Clinton stumped for him in the Senate primary, criticizing Greene's use of his own fortune to bankroll his candidacy. Florida's jobless rate -- 11.5 percent last month -- and third-highest mortgage- foreclosure rate after Nevada and Arizona have generated anxiety about the economy among voters. 'People in Florida are very upset at the administration; they are very upset at the stimulus package,' said Dario Moreno, a political scientist at Florida International University in Miami. 'These are the kinds of things that propelled these two outsiders,' he said of Scott and Greene. "
1,"Europe was leaning to the right Sunday as tens of millions of people voted in European Parliament elections, with conservative parties favored in many countries amid a global economic crisis. Opinion polls showed right-leaning governments edging the opposition in Germany, Italy, France, Belgium and elsewhere. Conservative opposition parties were tied or ahead in Britain, Spain and some smaller countries. Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands and five other EU nations cast ballots in the last three days, while the rest of the 27-nation bloc voted Sunday. Results for most countries were expected later in the day. The EU parliament has evolved over five decades from a consultative legislature to one with the power to vote on or amend two-thirds of all EU laws. It has 736 seats and lawmakers serve for five-year terms. With most votes counted in Austria, the main rightist party was gaining strongly while the Social Democrats, the main party in the governing coalition, lost substantial ground. The big winner was the rightist Freedom Party, which more than doubled its strength over the 2004 elections to 13 percent of the vote. It campaigned on an anti-Islam platform, with posters proclaiming 'The Occident in Christian hands' and describing Sunday as 'the day of reckoning.' In the Netherlands, exit polls predicted Geert Wilders' anti-Islamic party would win more than 15 percent of the country's votes, bruising a ruling alliance of Conservatives and Socialists. For many, the Europe-wide elections were most important as a snapshot of national political sentiment. High unemployment across Europe has increased voter dissatisfaction with mainstream national parties, and skepticism over the EU's power to help spur economic recovery. Polls predicted record low turnout and small but symbolically important gains for far-right groups and other fringe parties. 'It shows how divided the center-left forces are at the moment. Normally sitting governments are punished at European elections,' said Jackie Davis, an analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels. Groups like the all-white British National Party could use their EU parliament seats as a platform for their far-right views but were not expected to affect the assembly's increasingly influential lawmaking on issues ranging from climate change to cell-phone roaming charges. The parliament can also amend the EU budget -- euro120 billion ($170 billion) this year -- and approves candidates for the European Commission, the EU administration and the board of the European Central Bank. Still, many voters consider European Parliament members -- who earn euro7,665 ($10,430) a month -- to be overpaid, remote and irrelevant. Polls ahead of Sunday's vote showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats leading the center-left Social Democrats in Germany, which holds national elections in September. Merkel hopes to form a center-right government after the national vote with the pro-business Free Democrats. Voters in Germany are more concerned about the costs of financial intervention than the commitment to job preservation favored by the Social Democrats, said Tanja A. Boerzel, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University. 'The crisis hasn't affected Germany like it has the USA. Most Germans aren't struggling as much,' she said. In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative UMP party has steadily held the lead in polls, with the Socialist Party second. Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People's Party held a two-digit lead over his main center-left rival in the most recent polling despite a deep recession and a scandal over allegations he had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old model. In Britain, dissident Labour legislators said a plot to oust Prime Minister Gordon Brown could accelerate after the party's expected dismal results in the European elections are announced. Opponents say the Labour leader has been so tainted by the economic crisis and a scandal over lawmakers' expenses that the opposition Conservatives are virtually guaranteed to win the next national election, which must be called by June 2010. Polls favored left-leaning parties in some countries, such as Greece and Portugal. In Spain, where the recession has driven unemployment to 17.4 percent, Europe's highest, a close race was expected between the ruling Socialists and the conservative opposition. Poland's governing pro-business Civic Platform party was expected to claim around half of the country's 50 seats, followed by the conservative nationalist Law and Justice party -- a shift to the right for Poland at the European parliament. In Hungary, where the governing Socialist Party raised taxes and cut social programs in a deep financial crisis, the main center-right opposition party, Fidesz, was slated to win at least 15 of 22 seats. Jobbik, a far-right party accused by critics of racism and anti-Semitism, was expected to win one or two. In Sweden, the Green Party was expected to increase its support dramatically. The Pirate Party, which advocates shortening the duration of copyright protection and allowing noncommercial file-sharing between individuals, was expected to get one or two seats for the first time. Romanian police set up checkpoints around the country after widespread allegations of voting fraud. Officials said parties were offering voters from 50-100 lei (euros 12-24, $17-$34) to vote in several towns. ------ Associated Press writers Geir Moulson and Patrick McGroarty in Berlin, Elaine Ganley in Paris, Daniel Woolls and Harold Heckle in Madrid, Danica Kirka in London, Constant Brand in Brussels, Ryan Lucas in Warsaw, George Jahn in Vienna, Derek Gatopoulos in Athens, Barry Hatton in Lisbon, Alison Mutler in Bucarest, Romania, Keith Moore in Stockholm and Veselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, contributed to this report.

1,"Michele Scarponi won the 19th stage of the Giro d'Italia on Friday, and Ivan Basso overtook the overall leader's pink jersey from David Arroyo Duran after finishing second. Scarponi won the 195-kilometer (121-mile) ride from Brescia to Aprica in 5 hours, 27 minutes, 4 seconds, with Basso second and former pink jersey-holder Vincenzo Nibali third with the same time for an all-Italian podium. 'At various times I had the chance to attack, but I decided to stay with (Liquigas teammate) Vincenzo (Nibali),' Basso said. 'That way we could improve our positions together. Michele Scarponi made a great attack and it was our plan to stay with him.' Basso holds a 51-second lead over Arroyo Duran, who was seventh. The race ends Sunday, with Saturday's penultimate stage being a 178-kilometer (110-mile) climb from Bormio to Ponte di Legno-Tonale that is likely to decide the race. 'I think tomorrow for me will be a big battle,' Basso said. 'I know we have to continue the way we did today, work together as a team and stick to our plan.' Basso, Scarponi and Nibali broke away on the third climb toward Passo del Mortirolo, and then took turns in front to maintain their advantage ahead of the chasing pack. "
1,"It's Emmy nominations day _ that one day a year when the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences unveils its candidates for the industry's highest honor, and rabid fans of such shows as 'Lost,' 'American Idol,' 'Real Time With Bill Maher' and 'Two and a Half Men' set aside their differences and join hands to celebrate their shared view on the general knuckleheadedness of the academy in its choices. At an early-morning news conference Thursday _ watch for it on 'Today,' 'Good Morning America,' 'The Early Show,' 'E!' and other places too obscure to mention _ 'Community's' Joel McHale and 'Modern Family's' Sophia Vergara will grip the viewing public for about five minutes as they unveil contenders in the so-called glamour categories, but, in total, the academy unveils nominees in more than 100 categories. This year's clambake is expected to be particularly scintillating, what with so many pressing questions waiting to be answered: -- Will 'Saturday Night Live' finally become the most nominated program in TV history? It's had more than three decades to try to accomplish what doc drama 'ER' did in a short 15 seasons: rack up a record 124 nominations. 'SNL' hit 114 last year with 13 new noms _ which was a record for most nominations in a single awards year for a variety show. A repeat performance Thursday morning would put it over the top. Maybe now we know why the huge push to get Betty White to guest on the show by the end of May? -- Will 'Modern Family' or 'Glee' break the record set last year by '30 Rock' for most nominations ever clocked by a comedy in a single year (22)? -- Will Courteney Cox _ the only 'Friends' cast member never ever nominated on that show (yes, even Jennifer Aniston got a nomination, and Emmy, for best hair flinging and nose crinkling on the show) finally snag a nom for her 'Cougar Town' gig? Will TMZ or Radar be the first to post a quote from Aniston? -- And whither goest Lauren Graham, who starred on 'Gilmore Girls' for seven seasons with nary an Emmy nom because the series aired for most of its run, and all of its good seasons, on WB _ a network the academy was deeply invested in ignoring. Now that she's on NBC, in 'Parenthood,' will the academy throw her a bone? -- Has HBO spent its way to a record-breaker with its World War II project, the Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks-produced miniseries 'The Pacific'? Does $200 million get you 38 nominations, which would smash the record held by 'Roots' for most nominations ever (37) by a miniseries? "
1,"World markets continued to fall Wednesday, particularly in Asia, as investors worried that Europe's debt crisis would spread, as Greece braced itself for another wave of strikes. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 13.04 points, or 0.3 percent, at 5,397.14 while Germany's DAX fell 7.95 points, or 0.1 percent, at 5,998.91. The CAC-40 in France was 2.02 points, or 0.1 percent, lower at 3,687.27. Earlier in Asia, a number of markets slid as investors responded to the sharp declines recorded Tuesdsay in Europe and the U.S. -- Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed 435.51 points, or 2.1 percent, lower at 20,327.54. Not much relief is expected from Wall Street when it opens later -- Dow futures were up 1 point at 10,893 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 futures rose 0.5 point at 1,172.90. The main reason behind the selling pressure continues to be the Greek debt crisis -- the weekend's euro110 billion ($143 billion) bailout package for Greece has done little to assuage market fears that the crisis will spread to other countries like Portugal and Spain. 'Mass protests and strike action in Greece will bring the country to a halt this afternoon, doing sentiment in global markets no favour,' said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. A major casualty of the markets' heightened concerns about possible contagion has been the euro, which earlier dropped to $1.2936, its lowest level for over a year. By mid-morning London time, the euro was flat on the day at $1.2983. Policymakers would have hoped that the weekend bailout agreement would have helped shore up confidence in the markets following weeks of uncertainty. Instead, it seems to have generated concerns about the Greek government's ability to push through massive austerity measures in return for the cash. Wednesday's general strike in Greece is unlikely to assuage concerns that the government led by Prime Minister George Papandreou -- however sincere -- will get the popular backing it needs. Meanwhile, there are ongoing jitters in the markets that Portugal and Spain may be in the firing line next -- both have hefty borrowing levels that need to be brought down this year at the same time as debts have to be repaid. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the IMF, did his best to dampen down speculation that Portugal, in particular, is next in line for a bailout. 'Portugal has been mentioned, but it is already taking measures and the other countries are in a much more solid situation,' Strauss-Kahn told Le Parisien newspaper. For now though, that's not enough to calm down investors who think it's unlikely that the EU or the IMF would be able to fund anyone other than Greece -- one bailout maybe acceptable to the powers that be, but two could be stretching it. As a result, a number of analysts are beginning to think that the European Central Bank will have to get more involved in the crisis to keep Spain and Portugal from being dragged into a debt crisis quagmire like Greece, where market fears led to interest demands so high Athens couldn't borrow any more. The idea being openly discussed is that the ECB may support bond prices -- and the balance sheets of banks holding them -- by buying government bonds even though the bank's constitution says it can't directly bail out profligate governments. Elsewhere, markets will be keeping a close watch on upcoming U.S. data to see if the recovery is on a sure footing -- the payrolls firm ADP unveils its monthly survey later while the Institute for Supply Management publishes its monthly survey into the services sector. The big event this week is Friday's nonfarm payrolls data for April. Earlier in Asia, Australia's index skidded 1.3 percent, while Indonesia's main market dropped 2.6 percent and Taiwan sank 3 percent. China's benchmark Shanghai index, meanwhile, recovered early losses to rise 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan, South Korea and Thailand were closed for holidays. Asian countries, which have pared debt since the region's economic crisis of 1997 and 1998, will likely fare better than elsewhere if Europe's debt crisis worsens, DBS said.

1,"Former Liberian President Charles Taylor's defense lawyers on Monday opposed a request by prosecutors at his war crimes trial to call supermodel Naomi Campbell as a witness, branding the move 'a publicity stunt.' Prosecutors earlier this month filed a motion seeking to have Campbell subpoenaed to testify about claims Taylor gave her 'blood diamonds' at a reception in South Africa in 1997. But Taylor's lawyers said the evidence was 'tangential to the real issues' against Taylor and said prosecutors were trying to introduce it too late in the trial -- 15 months after they closed their case. 'For the prosecution to present such inferential evidence at this advanced stage, as part of an obvious publicity stunt, would bring the administration of justice into serious disrepute,' Taylor's British lawyer Courtenay Griffiths wrote to judges. According to the prosecution motion seeking a subpoena, Campbell told prosecutors through her lawyer she does not want to get involved in the case and is concerned for her safety. Prosecutors want Campbell to testify about Taylor's alleged gift of diamonds along with actress Mia Farrow and another witness, Carole White, who were both at the same reception in South Africa. In a written statement to the court, Farrow said Campbell told her that two or three men woke her up and 'presented her with a large diamond which they said was from Charles Taylor.' White says she heard Taylor say he was going to give Campbell diamonds and saw them being delivered. Prosecutors say Campbell's testimony would provide 'direct evidence of the accused's possession of rough diamonds from a witness unrelated to the Liberian or Sierra Leone conflicts.' Taylor, once one of West Africa's most powerful men, is charged with 11 counts of murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers and terrorism in his role backing rebels in Sierra Leone's 1991-2002 civil war. An estimated 500,000 people were the victims of killings, systematic mutilation or other atrocities in that war, with some of the worst crimes committed by child soldiers who were drugged to desensitize them. It is unclear when judges will rule on the prosecution request. "
1,"Lucy King's passion for the trombone was too big to fit on a college application. So she traveled to the College of William and Mary this month to tell someone about it in person. 'You can't really beat having a face-to-face communication,' said King, 17, a senior from Carlisle, Mass. The public college and other selective schools are rediscovering the admission interview, a ritual that had fallen out of favor in recent years because of concerns about equity and expense. With tens of thousands of applicants at many institutions, colleges are more desperate than ever for any scrap of intel that might distinguish one straight-A student from another. As a new admission cycle begins this summer, colleges are finding there's nothing like an interview to bring out revelatory details. Lucy King talked about the Concord-Carlisle Regional High School concert band. Another William and Mary visitor challenged his interviewer to pick a number from one to 1,000 and then calculated its square in his head. Someone else recounted his feats as a world-champion wooden-duck carver. Students have danced, done comedic impersonations and showed YouTube videos. All of this plays out in six closet-size rooms under the admissions office, where trained college seniors meet with probable applicants for half-hour sessions while anxious parents wait in a reception room upstairs. But interviews don't always help. Some overwrought William and Mary applicants have broken down in tears. One young man asked his interviewer to rate the looks of female students on a 10-point scale. Another decided mid-interview to take a call on his cellphone. A good interview or bad one can help admission committees sift through a crowded field. 'It seems like everybody who applies is the captain of their cross-country team, is a section leader in their orchestra, is in National Honor Society, has 1450 SAT scores, has a four-point-something ridiculous grade-point average,' said Nick Velleman, who interviewed King. 'When everyone is like that, then we start looking for the people who really stand out.' But few institutions have the resources to meet with 10,000 or 20,000 prospective students, one at a time. College interviews were on the wane until recently. By 2007, most Ivy League schools had halted formal campus interviews, with the exceptions of Yale and Harvard. The sheer number of visitors had become unwieldy, and the endeavor seemed unfair to those who lived far away and could not afford travel expenses. 'We felt that students who managed to come to campus were not reflective of the diversity of our applicant pool,' said Maria Laskaris, dean of admissions and financial aid at Dartmouth College. But the interview appears to be making a modest comeback. Some colleges are finding new ways to make personal connections on a large scale. Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth reach more applicants than ever through their global alumni networks. Stanford University launched an alumni interview program two years ago in six cities and is offering its first interviews in the Washington region this year. The effort will reach about 5,000 students, a fraction of Stanford's 32,000 applicants. In 2008, Wake Forest University in North Carolina began offering interviews via webcam, using the Internet telephone service Skype. Debate persists about the value of interviews. Admission officials gently encourage the belief among applicants that a face-to-face meeting will help their chances. But they play down the interview's role in the admission process and fight the perception that it bestows an unfair advantage. Surveys of college officials suggest that interviews typically are less important than grades or test scores but more important than extracurriculars. The share of colleges attaching 'considerable importance' to the interview rose from 9 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2008 on the annual survey of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Many colleges that offer interviews struggle over how much weight to assign them, lest they penalize students who can't meet face to face. 'We need to be judicious in how much emphasis we can put on the evaluation aspect,' said Eric Furda, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, whose alumni interview about one-quarter of applicants.

1,"The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: There are many ways to interpret the election results in Massachusetts last week. Republican Scott Brown's improbable victory can be seen as a repudiation of President Obama's policies. You could say that it reflects nothing more than the shortcomings of the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley. Or it may be an outburst of economic frustration aimed at no party and no politician in particular. But one thing Massachusetts did not represent was a mandate to make a national scapegoat out of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board chairman. Yet two Democratic senators seeking re-election in November, Barbara Boxer of California and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, plus another planning to retire, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, appear to read it that way. They took the occasion of last week's political upheaval to announce their opposition to another four-year term for Mr. Bernanke, whose current one expires Jan. 31. These senators' attempt to burnish their populist credentials by making Mr. Bernanke the fall guy for all the sins, real and perceived, of Wall Street fuels the right-left anti-Fed chorus in Congress that has already produced troubling attempts to subject the Fed to intrusive and counterproductive audits of its monetary policy. Many others in both parties are nervously or opportunistically sitting on the fence. The prospect that the Fed-bashers might actually come up with the votes to thwart Mr. Bernanke sparked a sell-off on Wall Street and prompted more than a little head-scratching among U.S. trade and investment partners abroad. Mr. Bernanke has made mistakes, some that he has acknowledged _ such as the failure to regulate the mortgage market more rigorously before the financial meltdown _ and some that he still does not concede _ such as his support for the Fed's easy-money policies under his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. The Federal Reserve in general and Mr. Bernanke in particular must never be immune from appropriate accountability. Still, he has responded ably and appropriately to the crisis; without his leadership, the nation's economic condition might well be catastrophic, not merely difficult. But the issue now is much bigger than whether Mr. Bernanke gets another term. By threatening his tenure for no apparent reason other than political panic and pandering, his new opponents have turned this confirmation process into a test of central bank independence, which is an indispensable element of modern economic management. If a stampede of spooked senators were to trample Mr. Bernanke's confirmation, the message to markets would be that the value of the U.S. dollar is hostage to short-term politics. That would deliver a huge, possibly lasting, blow to the economy. The White House continues to back Mr. Bernanke, as do key Senate leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. The Fed chairman's supporters predict that cooler heads will ultimately prevail. Let's hope they're right. "
1,"JERUSALEM - Israel's formula for boosting trade to China is to hang at the Expo Museum in Shanghai. It's E(equals)mc2, the Albert Einstein discovery that the government uses to symbolize the virtues of its technology companies. Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz brought a reproduction of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, the original of which is at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, when he visited the Shanghai Expo in May. The Shanghai authorities requested the copy for their museum. 'The manuscript will maintain the image of Israel, a country that exports to China, as a center of innovation,' Consul Jackie Eldan said in a phone interview. 'This gift translates into guan xi, which is important to the Chinese and means good contacts, good relationships.' Israel is looking to Asia as growth in the United States and European Union remains relatively slow. Exports to Asia climbed by more than 50 percent in the first 10 months of 2010 compared with the same period a year ago, almost double the pace for Europe and quadruple the pace for the U.S., the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said in November. Exports make up about 40 percent of Israel's gross domestic product, which was $110 billion in the first half of 2010. Israeli companies need to expand sales beyond a home market that has a population of only 7.7 million. Many of Israel's neighbors, such as Lebanon and Syria, remain technically at war with the Jewish state. About 60 percent of goods are sold to the U.S. and Europe while 20 percent go to Asia, the Bank of Israel said in a September report. 'Our exporters have to be searching for markets in a growing part of the world which is obviously Asia, obviously the two giant economies in Asia,' Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer said. Petach Tikva-based Strauss Group, Israel's biggest food company, announced in October that a unit had agreed to market water-purification products in China. Nice Systems, a maker of digital recording and analysis systems, said in May that it would provide a security system to India's parliament. In business meetings, 'the Chinese thought we had an advantage by being Israelis and they mentioned Albert Einstein,' said Nice Chief Executive Officer Zeev Bregman, who started selling Israeli technology in China with a different company in the early 1990s. 'The Albert Einstein brand belongs to the state of Israel, you know,' he said with a smile. Steinitz pledged during his visit to set up so-called Einstein Centers across China to provide services, information and a physical base for Israeli companies doing business there. Israel claims Einstein in part because more than 43,000 records from the physicist whose work paved the way for the nuclear era are housed at the university in Jerusalem. The German-born Einstein, who became a naturalized American citizen, was offered the presidency of Israel in 1952 by Premier David Ben-Gurion. He declined. The government is weighing spending more on trade promotion activities in India and China, said Boaz Hirsch, deputy director general for foreign trade in Israel's Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor. Negotiations for a free-trade agreement with India are underway, and a government committee, appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is considering ways to boost exports to China. Israel began its serious push into Asia after the global financial crisis, said Eli Bitan, head of Tel Aviv- based Bank Hapoalim's Hong Kong office. Israelis 'have been focused on one type of customer over the last years, which is the U.S., and clearly they have to change their mindset,' he said. Israel must also be careful when selling technologies that might have a military use to avoid upsetting the U.S., said Steven Popper, a senior economist at the Santa Monica, Calif.-based RAND Corp. 'If Israelis are in a position to sell to the Chinese technologies that the U.S. government and the U.S. military consider to be particularly sensitive, they certainly run the risk of harming relationships they have cultivated with the U.S. and consider to be important,' Popper said by phone. China increasingly sees Israel as a different avenue to gain access to the newest technologies, said Nicolas Pechet, managing director of the Global Intelligence Alliance Group, Shanghai. GIA is a global strategic advisory firm based in Helsinki. He cited clean energy as an area with potential. 'China now faces massive challenges with this so it's a match made in heaven for Israeli companies and the Chinese,' he said in a phone interview. 'We'll see huge growth in trade between Israel and China in these segments in coming years.' "
1,"These days, federal safety investigators are scrutinizing Toyota, seeking the elusive causes behind hundreds of reports of unintended acceleration. But a decade ago, the federal safety agency were facing another high-profile technical mystery: More than 100 people had died in Ford Explorers. Was it faulty Firestone tires or was the Explorer itself too prone to rollover? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration eventually sided with the automaker, blaming the tires and rejecting charges that the most popular sport- utility vehicle was unstable. But previously unreported internal Ford documents dredged up in lawsuits since then conflict with the finding that only tires were to blame and call into question the agency's decision not to open a full investigation into the Explorer. The Ford memos show that the company's own engineers had discovered potential dangers in two key Explorer features, its suspension and roof strength, that could make the vehicle especially lethal during a blowout. After an investigation into 50 Explorer crashes in Venezuela, for example, company engineers concluded that they should replace the shock absorbers for customers to 'save lives.' They did, but only in Venezuela. Explorer engineers also twice sought official deviations from the company's own standards for roof strength, a factor that critics say made the cars more lethal in rollover accidents. In response, Ford says that the Explorer complied with all federal safety standards, and that the engineers in Venezuela were only exploring one of many theories for the crashes. But the documents, which Ford has sought to keep from becoming public, indicate that it was hardly a clear-cut case. 'The whole thing just screamed greed,' said La Rita Morales, part of a jury in California that earlier this year awarded an Explorer driver $23.4 million in damages. 'I didn't believe in my heart that a company like Ford would put out a product with question marks over it.' NHTSA officials now say they were aware of the issue with the shock absorbers and discussed the crashes with Venezuelan government officials. But in an echo of the Toyota controversy, which has led to another call in Washington for safety reform, the federal agency declined in 2002 to open a formal investigation into the Ford Explorer, just as it had declined for years to open investigations into the Toyota complaints of unintended acceleration. Even 10 years ago, NHTSA had some reason to be skeptical of the idea that the tires were the sole cause of Explorer accidents. While Ford was pointing the finger at Firestone's tires, the tiremaker was pointing back, blaming the Explorer for rolling over too easily in blowouts. Consumer advocates argued that during a blowout, a driver should be able to 'pull over, not rollover.' An analysis by The Post in 2000 showed that even when the Explorer was equipped with Goodyear tires rather than Firestone products, they had a higher rate of tire-related crashes than other SUVs. The head of the House committee investigating the accidents, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, said that NHTSA data warranted further scrutiny of the Explorer's handling. But Ford officials were adamant. 'It bears repeating: This is a tire issue and only a tire issue,' Ford chief executive Jacques Nasser testified at a House committee hearing in June 2001. Yet according to the documents, Ford's recognition of a problem dates back at least to 1999, when Ford engineers investigating Explorer crashes in Venezuela found a problem with the Explorer's stability. In a hard shift, 'the truck tends to roll over,' according to the report of one of the engineers, Edivia Caballero. She listed the shock absorber as a 'root cause' of the Explorer crashes in Venezuela, along with bad tires and the fact that the Explorer is taller and narrower than other trucks. Ford issued a bulletin to replace the shock absorbers on Explorers in Venezuela, according to the documents. This change of shocks in Venezuela 'will save lives,' according to one Ford e-mail. But the automaker did not offer customers new shocks in the United States. In response, Ford says that the engineers who wrote the memos about the shocks were just speculating about the cause of the accidents. As for why the company, based on mere speculation, would give Venezuelan customers new shock absorbers at an estimated cost of $3 million, Ford says the shock absorbers were changed to accommodate Venezuelan drivers who preferred a firmer ride. 'The roads are different in Venezuela, the drivers load them up more, and they drive very fast,' said Ford spokesman Said Deep. The other potential Explorer problem discussed in the memos is the strength of the roof. Many experts blame the deaths in rollover crashes to a phenomenon known as 'roof crush.' At the time, vehicle roofs were required by federal standards to stand up to 1.5 times the vehicle's weight. It was called the 'strength-to-weight' ratio. Internal Ford guidelines called for a ratio of 1.875 in order to add a margin of safety. That way, even with variations in sheet metal strength and other production variables, Ford roofs could pass the federal standard. Bur Explorer's engineers twice requested and received official 'deviations' from that company standard, first dropping to a ratio of 1.72 and then 1.63. This allowed Explorers with weaker roofs to pass the tests. Then in June 1999, engineers tested another Explorer. The roof strength was lower than they had expected _ it was 1.52 _ just above the federal guidelines, but almost completely without the margin of safety that other Ford vehicles had. It was just over the federal guideline, and by some tests, the weakest of the best-selling SUVs. It was also far lower than current federal standard, which was last year doubled to 3. The engineers at the time appear to have been startled. 'The max load numbers experienced were less than expected,' a Ford engineer wrote to colleagues in 1999. 'We need to make a concerted effort to quickly find out why.' The roof has 'a less than desirable safety margin,' another engineer said. Ford officials noted recently that no Ford Explorer has failed the federal standard for roof crush. They said the lowest of the roof tests were conducted on prototype vehicles and do not indicate how production vehicles would perform. After months of study in 2001, NHTSA dismissed Firestone's complaints that the Explorer had a problem with 'oversteering' in a blowout. In a lengthy report, NHTSA found that in that respect the Explorer was no worse than other SUVs on the market. There would be no formal investigation of the Explorer. 'NHTSA didn't open the investigation because it wasn't asking the right question,' said Richard Denney, an Oklahoma attorney for victims in Explorer cases. 'They do some good work, but they don't have the resources.' As he and other plaintiffs' attorneys have argued to juries, sometimes successfully, the problem in the Explorer is not oversteering but a phenomenon known as 'skate' caused by vibrations in the rear axle _ vibrations that occur for example when a tire blows out. After the controversy, Ford made critical changes to the Explorer. For the 2002 model year, the distance between the wheels was widened by about three inches, making it less prone to roll over. Critically, independent rear suspension was added. NHTSA, meanwhile, continued to grapple with Explorer complaints and crashes. Five years ago, Stephen Forrest, a California engineer who testifies in Explorer cases, called the roofs into question and asked NHTSA to investigate. The agency declined, citing, among other things, limited resources and the fact that none of the vehicles had actually failed the test. Then, in March 2006, the Explorer again seems to have aroused the agency's interest. It asked Ford for information on deaths in Ford Explorers from late 2000 t0 2005. It did not open an investigation. Even after the Firestone tires were recalled, tire-related deaths in Ford Explorers of that era continued. After skyrocketing in 2000 to 81, tire-related deaths in Explorers have averaged 49 over the last five years of records. The statistics were compiled by Randy Whitfield and Alice Whitfield, experts who work with plaintiffs' attorneys. A Ford spokesman did not dispute the counts but said that the federal statistics cited by the Whitfields do not accurately count tire-related deaths. 'The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and others have repeatedly tested the Ford Explorer. All of those tests consistently showed that the Explorer is a safe vehicle,' said Ford spokesman Deep. 'We have always maintained that it is safe.' "
1,"Actress Bijou Phillips says she knew her half-sister Mackenzie Phillips had consensual sex with their father, Mamas and the Papas leader John Phillips. In a statement read by Oprah Winfrey on her talk show Friday, Bijou Phillips says she was 13 years old when Mackenzie Phillips told her about the sexual relationship. Bijou Phillips is now 29 and says the news was confusing and scary. She says it was 'heartbreaking' to think her family would leave her alone with her father. Appearing as a guest on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' Friday, Mackenzie Phillips said their father 'had changed his ways as much as he was able to' and she felt Bijou Phillips was safe. Mackenzie Phillips says she did go get her sister when she 'felt like she wasn't being watched properly.' "
1,"Top-seeded Robin Soderling withdrew from the Stockholm Open semifinals Saturday because of an elbow injury, allowing Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus to advance to the final where he will play Olivier Rochus. The Belgian outlasted Tomaz Bellucci of Brazil 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3 to reach Sunday's final at Royal Tennis Hall. Soderling has been bothered by a sore right elbow since July, when he withdrew from the quarterfinals in Washington. A trainer treated him several times during the second set in the quarterfinals Friday against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain. 'I felt so much pain when I played in Asia. I had an MRI Tuesday and they told me that I have to rest two, three weeks to get well,' Soderling said. Soderling is battling for one of the two remaining spots for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London next month. He has not decided if he'll play upcoming tournaments in Valencia and Paris. 'I haven't withdrawn from any tournaments so far,' Soderling said. 'I'll just wait and see and have more medical examinations.' The 10th-ranked Swede, a surprising finalist in the French Open this year, was the only seeded player left in the tournament. 'I'm sorry for Robin first of all,' Baghdatis said. 'It's not easy to retire, especially when you're playing at home. But obviously I'm happy to get through to the final. I need some points and my ranking is not so good right now. I knew it would not have been an easy match for me today. He was the favourite, playing with the home support and indoors. So I'm just happy to get through.' Baghdatis has played great all week long, not losing a set in his three matches. This is his best ATP Tour result of the year. Ranked 66th, Baghdatis has won two career titles. He's looking forward to playing his practice partner on Sunday. 'Rochus is playing great,' Baghdatis said. 'He's a good friend of mine and we've warmed up together every day this week. It's nice to play a friend in the final.' Rochus, ranked 87th, also has two career titles. 'I played a good match,' he said. 'I stayed positive and didn't give up, that's why I won.' "
1,"It took Tyson Gay just 9.75 seconds to prove that he's healthy, and leave the rest of the track world wondering -- and maybe worrying -- about what he might do next. With a helping wind at his back, America's best-known sprinter ran his 100 preliminary heat in the seventh-fastest time under any conditions Thursday, then exited stage right, not to be seen again at the U.S. championships. About a half hour after he ran, Gay's coaches confirmed he wouldn't be racing again this week. 'But I want to,' Gay said. 'Because I ran a horrible race.' Already qualified for this summer's world championships in Berlin, Gay used this single race at nationals as a warm up. Because of the wind, the 9.75 won't go down as the new American record, even though this was .02 seconds faster than the mark he set last year on the same track. Record or no, over the past four weeks, Gay has made his point: He's ready to take on world-record holder Usain Bolt. Combine this with the 19.58 he clocked in the 200 in May in New York -- only the third sub-19.6 ever in that event -- and it's clear Gay is over whatever ailed him last year when an injury in the 200 at Olympic trials, also on the same track in Eugene, derailed his season. Was he trying to send a message? 'Not necessarily to anybody in particular, but more for myself,' he said. 'I knew it was wind-aided, so of course it doesn't go into the books. But at the same time, it still lets me know that my legs are ready to turn over faster. They're a lot faster when I execute the beginning part.' Gay's eye-opening time came despite a bad start and stood as the biggest -- or maybe the best -- news on the first day of nationals, which lost a star before they even began when Olympic decathlon champion Bryan Clay withdrew with an injury. Olympic champion LaShawn Merritt cruised to a win in 45.23 seconds in his 400 prelim, which was missing Jeremy Wariner, who also has a bye into worlds. Wariner will run in the 200 later this week. Stephanie Brown Trafton added a national title to the Olympic gold medal she won last year in discus. Amy Yoder Begley outkicked Olympic bronze medalist Shalane Flanagan at the end of the women's 10,000 for a mild upset. Gay will leave Eugene with a 9.75-second body of work that included a clumsy move out of the blocks. Moments before the race started, a false start left everyone in the field one flinch away from being disqualified. 'So I had too much going through my mind, instead of worrying about execution,' he said. 'When I got out of the blocks, I felt sloppy, felt someone beside me. I think it was Leroy Dixon, who was winning until about 60. Then I caught up with the field and tried to run relaxed through the finish line.' Gay beat Dixon by .25 seconds and second-place finisher Monzavous Edwards by .23. The 2007 world champion said if it had been up to him, he'd race again this week. But there are coaches and agents and schedules to keep, and it appears his team was satisfied with simply seeing him shake out the cobwebs. The semifinals should still offer some drama, though. Olympic medalists Shawn Crawford and Walter Dix and 60-meter indoor champion Michael Rodgers all moved onto Friday with ease. "
1,"For the first time in his life, Teemu Selanne almost wishes he was off his game. If the Finnish Flash hadn't played so well during the Anaheim Ducks' disappointing NHL season, his future would be much clearer. He could head off to retirement with his wife and four children, comfortablly knowing he had used every bit of his remarkable talent. Instead, the 39-year-old forward has been mostly outstanding, with 47 points in 53 games while fighting injuries during a season that included a bronze medal at the Vancouver Olympics. His resurgence, combined with the Ducks' struggles, are forcing him to waffle on his retirement plans. 'You almost hope you don't play so well like this, so it's easier,' Selanne said with a laugh. 'When I've been healthy, I've been having so much fun.' Though he still seems to be leaning toward retirement, he has sounded increasingly open to a return in recent weeks. That's largely because Selanne has 26 goals -- including his 600th -- and 21 assists, ranking 37th in the NHL with .89 points per game despite missing a significant chunk of the season with a broken jaw and a broken finger. Anaheim finishes the season at home against Edmonton on Sunday, but even Selanne isn't certain it will be his NHL finale. 'This time, I'm not going to set any timetable,' said Selanne, nominated this week for the Masterton Trophy, an award he won in 2006. 'I'm going to tell when I'm ready, and I'm not going to say I'll decide by one time or another.' This waiting game is nothing new to Ducks fans, who waited two months in the 2007-08 regular season before Selanne and captain Scott Niedermayer decided to return from Anaheim's only championship team. The Ducks have been willing to wait for their veterans during past offseasons, although general manager Bob Murray hasn't made any firm pronouncements about the future of his roster or coach Randy Carlyle, who led Anaheim to its only title in 2007. If Selanne skates away, the last few weeks have been a celebration of the remarkable career of the Ducks' franchise goals leader, who broke into the NHL with a 76-goal season with the Winnipeg Jets in 1992-93. Selanne became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals on March 21 against Colorado, and he has tacked on five more in his last four games, passing boyhood idol Jari Kurri (601). When Anaheim honored Selanne for his 600th goal before a game against Dallas last month, the Honda Center crowd repeatedly chanted 'One more year!' But Selanne also has received plenty of reminders why he might want to relax. His jaw was broken by a deflected shot on Jan. 13 against Boston, and he returned after just 2 1/2 weeks with a bulky shield protecting his face. Earlier this season, he missed five weeks after surgery to repair a broken bone in the middle finger of his left hand, also caused by a shot. 'The injuries have definitely made it so tough,' Selanne said. 'When you're not healthy and you spend so much time just trying to get ready to play, that's when you really think about your family and the future. But even when I've been hurt this year, I've come back and played well.' He came back from his jaw injury after eight games, giving him plenty of time to prepare to lead Finland into Vancouver, where Selanne became the leading scorer in Olympic ice hockey history while helping the Finns to a medal in their third straight Olympics. That hasn't made the Ducks' lousy season any easier, however. Anaheim will miss the playoffs for the first time in five seasons. 'I don't know the last time I didn't make the playoffs,' said Selanne, who last missed the postseason with the San Jose Sharks in 2003. 'It's definitely not the way you want to represent yourself, and I know all of our guys feel like we're better than that.

1,"Walter Fredrick Morrison, the man credited with inventing the Frisbee, has died. He was 90. State Rep. Kay McIff, an attorney who once represented Morrison in a royalties case, says Morrison died at his home Tuesday. McIff is from Richfield, Morrison's original hometown. Morrison sold the production and manufacturing rights to his 'Pluto Platter' in 1957. The plastic flying disc was later renamed the 'Frisbee,' with sales surpassing 200 million discs. It is now a staple at beaches and college campuses across the country and spawned sports like Frisbee golf and the team sport Ultimate. Morrison co-wrote a book with Frisbee enthusiast and historian Phil Kennedy in 2001. Kennedy released a brief statement about Morrison on Thursday, wishing his late friend 'smoooooth flights.' "
1,"WASHINGTON -- Some choices look easy. Between Nevada Republican Sharron Angle, an ardent believer in the constitutional right to bear arms anywhere from a national park to a corner bar, and one of Washington's most powerful Democrats, who would the National Rifle Association choose? If you said Angle, that's the easy choice, and probably the wrong one. The NRA's political arm has yet to make endorsements, but gun owners around the U.S. are worried, with evident reason, that the group may be prepared to forsake Angle for her Democratic opponent, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. Angle's devotion to gun rights is unquestioned. In one interview, she coyly wouldn't say whether she was carrying a concealed weapon because she didn't want the bad guys to know. When 'government becomes tyrannical,' she has said, it's the citizenry's right to lock and load. And she fretted: 'People are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying, `My goodness, what can we do to turn this country around?' I'll tell you, the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out.' She later acknowledged that comment might have been 'a little strong,' and that, lest the trigger-happy among her supporters misunderstand her, she meant 'take him out of office.' Reid occasionally flirts with the NRA, as Western Democrats must, but mostly breaks its heart. He helped secure land and funding for a 2,900-acre park for shooting and gamely took down clay birds with his 12-gauge shotgun at the opening in March. He worked to keep insurance premiums from being raised on those who keep a gun at home and supported a carve-out exempting the NRA from new campaign-donation disclosure requirements. The gun owners' bill of particulars against Reid is longer. He supported the confirmation of Attorney General Eric Holder, who strongly favors gun limits. He is currently pushing the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, a vote the NRA is going to score. That should bring Reid's rating, even grading on a curve, to a gentleman's 'C' from the 'B' he received the last time he ran, in 2004. The Gun Owners of America, by contrast, gives Reid an 'F.' So why is the NRA on such a different page? While his headquarters may be in Fairfax, Va., NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre is part of the Washington firmament. And like the Christian Coalition before it, LaPierre's NRA is forgetting the faithful -- who, online, are up in arms about a possible Reid endorsement. LaPierre has a lot to crow about. The NRA just won a ruling from the Supreme Court that states and cities are bound by the Second Amendment. What did the rank-and-file, those weekend minutemen or militia men or patriots in camouflage, have to do with that? At the core, LaPierre has more in common with the heretic Reid than with a sweaty believer like Angle. She's proven to be a strong brew even by Tea Party standards. Before Republicans muffled her, she was for gradually privatizing Social Security, defunding the new health-care system, abolishing the income-tax code and massively cutting the federal government, including eliminating the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, which probably are too busy trying to clean up the Gulf of Mexico to pay much attention to Nevada politics. Even right-wing voters in her state must gulp at her desire to make Yucca Mountain home to the country's nuclear waste. Asked if she'd permit abortion in the case of a teen-ager raped by her father, Angle said no -- two wrongs don't make a right, and the teen-ager should make lemonade from lemons. Such views aren't likely to attract the growing number of independents in Nevada's suburbs and are splitting the state GOP. One pragmatic concern is that if Reid loses and Republicans don't retake the Senate, the NRA leadership would be faced with a new majority leader who wouldn't know one end of a rifle from the other. One likely candidate to replace Reid in that scenario is Charles Schumer, Democrat of -- dare I say it? -- New York. No one should blame NRA leaders for preferring the devil they know to a city slicker who would pry guns from the fingers of law-abiding citizens in a New York minute. Majority Leader Schumer: that's enough to scare the bejesus out of any gun owner, concealed or not.

1,"Gardeners are outdoors taking advantage of this perfect season preparing for fall, and your questions are signaling that the season is right around the corner. Q: I have a bed of sedum sexangular. It came through the snowy winter just fine. After flowering last spring, portions of the plants turned brown and look awful. Should I shear it? When? A: Sedum sexangular (<I>S. sexanulare</I> ), also commonly called tasteless stonecrop, is extremely tolerant of cold conditions. This European native is also quite tolerant of drought but will not endure with poor drainage. In wet situations it's quite susceptible to root rot, and your browned plants might have experienced too much wetness in spring. Improve drainage around your plants by adding a fine-textured gravel (chicken grit) into the soil in the area. Shear back browned and dead stems before growth begins in spring. Clean your shears with bleach, and oil them lightly before using them on any other plants. Q: I have a thick lawn that my neighbors say is the best in the neighborhood. I have done all of the things you recommend except adding compost, but have that scheduled for this fall. After aerating I am planning to spread a few bags of gypsum to try and break up the red clay soil, hard as concrete, that is under the sod. Do you recommend using gypsum? A: Without breaking down the fine-textured clay into a more pervious surface, what you have is a layer of impermeable soil with a lawn that you are supporting from above with fertilizer and irrigation. To encourage deep rooting and create conditions where water can percolate through the clay layer, use a plug aerator to make numerous and deep aeration holes. Soil that is high in sodium and clay will often be impermeable to water. It takes many years of aeration every spring and fall for compost to enrich a clay-based soil so that it is permeable to water. Gypsum in your soil or lawn preparation regimen is an excellent idea. Spread it in a broadcast or drop spreader. According to the text 'Soils' (Prentice Hall, 1983), applications of gypsum (calcium sulfate) for three years increased percolation to 19 inches, from only 10 inches in soil that did not receive gypsum. On the basis of this study, and recommendations from the late plant scientist (and my friend) H. Marc Cathay , gypsum will always improve soil. The recommended rate of gypsum application is about 40 to 80 pounds per thousand square feet depending on whether you are turning it into the soil or broadcasting it over existing vegetation. Q: I need a suggestion for a viburnum about 8 to 10 feet tall and 6 to 8 feet wide. I would like something that has a moderate growth rate and is shade- tolerant. A: Allegheny viburnum (V. rhytidophylloides) will give you flowers and is deer- resistant. It has a leathery leaf, is semi-evergreen and grows moderately fast. After a decade of growth, it will mature at about 10 feet by 10 feet. Q: I am trying to have a chemical-free lawn and have been working on it for the last three years with considerable success. I am about to start my fall treatment and am curious what kind of seed you usually use. A: I consider cool-season, dwarf, turf-type tall fescue to be the best- performing grass for lawns in the D.C. region. It needs at least six hours of sun per day to become lush. There are hundreds of hybrids; choose one that is named and contains at least three varieties. The recommended seeding rate for new lawns is approximately eight to 10 pounds per 1,000 square feet; for established lawns, use about 4 to 5 pounds for the same area. Water is the key to seed germination and growth. Q: I'm a little confused as to the timing of the lawn tasks you recommend _ aerate, compost, overseed, fertilize and weed control? Can I do some of these on the same day? A: You cannot seed a lawn and spread weed control material at the same time; the latter will keep grass seed from germinating. Do pre-emergent weed control in late winter, early spring when the soil is moist but not soggy. All other tasks can be done on the same day in the following order: aerate, sprinkle fine textured compost into holes, overseed and fertilize. (Fertilizing is optional pending a soil test.) Keep the soil moist as long as grass is growing. Remove accumulations of leaves from young grass. Q: I have variegated winter daphne on the north side of my home within the shadow of the building most of the day. They have been there for at least 40 years. I would like to plant two new plants I recently purchased in a location where we can enjoy their lovely odor _ either near an outside deck or preferably in the front of the house. How should I proceed? A: A variegated daphne that has thrived in its location for 40 years is located in the perfect microclimate and soil. Try to re-create the conditions of these shrubs, and find out their botanical name to be sure you use a similar plant. We grew a variegated daphne (<I>Daphne X burkwoodii</I> 'Carol Mackie') for about 15 years before it succumbed to last winter's snow. Carol Mackie is one of the hardier daphnes. A protected, lightly shaded location in soil that is low in organic material seems to be the best environment. _ Lerner is president of Environmental Design in Capitol View Park, Md., and author of 'Anyone Can Landscape'(Ball 2001).

1,"Luigi 'Giggino' Nocerino once stalked tourists through the tight alleys of this southern Italian city, snatching bags and valuables to fuel his drug addiction. Now he looks after his former prey, escorting them through bad neighborhoods and giving tips on how to avoid muggings and where to eat the best pizza. Nocerino is one of 70 former convicts, including muggers, drug traffickers and con artists, hired by authorities to guide tourists through the art-rich but crime-plagued city and use their inside knowledge of the local underworld to keep visitors safe. Officials say the six-month experiment that began in May is succeeding in reducing petty crime and preventing the ex-cons from falling back into old habits or joining the ranks of the Camorra, the powerful mob syndicate that runs global drug rings out of Naples. 'I used to hunt for tourists. How things have changed,' Nocerino marvels, recalling how he spent more than 10 of his 43 years serving prison terms for drug-related offenses. Nocerino and his fellow guides roam tourist-filled areas, like the historic center of Naples or its port, wearing bright yellow vests identifying them, in somewhat mangled English, as 'Operator for the Urban Tourist Assistance.' Some speak basic English and Spanish but most use Italians' expressive hand gestures to get the message across. They walk around in groups accompanied by a supervisor, usually a private security guard, who knows them and reports on their performance. Their job can include pointing the way to a monument, helping tourists negotiate a cab fare or walking them to a specific pizzeria or a pastry shop. The service is free and tips are not encouraged. Giovanni Aspride, a 53-year-old former counterfeiter, said he and his colleagues usually wait for tourists to approach them, though they may come forward if somebody seems desperately lost or to tell a visitor to remove a gold watch or tuck a wallet in a safer pocket. Though their criminal record does not have to be revealed, the guides are not shy about discussing it if it comes up in conversation. On a busy shopping street on Tuesday, Aspride pointed an American couple just off a cruise ship toward baroque churches in the area, then checked that they weren't wearing any jewelry that could attract unwanted attention. 'You OK,' he told them in broken English. The tourists were unfazed when told Aspride had served time. 'It's a great way to reintegrate them into society,' said Brooke Cervine March, 37, of Santa Fe, New Mexico. 'Everybody deserves a second chance.' Her husband, Scott Cervine, said a fellow cruise passenger bought an MP3 player from a street vendor, only to find out later that he'd been conned. Aspride smiled as he recognized the trademark 'pacco' -- the package trick. Unscrupulous street vendors will display a high-tech gizmo, then place it in a box, which at the last moment is switched with one that's empty or contains a heavy object. The guides must call police if they see anything suspicious, but officials say that in some cases they have taken matters into their own hands, chasing off muggers or returning lost property to tourists. When the government of the Campania region, which has Naples as its capital, started the project the idea caused uproar. Applicants went through interviews and were chosen based on any previous working experience and language skills. Serious offenders including murderers, rapists and mobsters were ruled out. Still, critics complained the ex-cons could be a danger to tourists and tarnish the image of a city already reputed as unsafe. 'We were accused of putting the wolves in charge of the sheep,' said Corrado Gabriele, the regional official in charge of labor issues. 'I think convicts should not be marked for life and, once they have served their sentence, we have a duty to help them.' The project has had its rough moments: one of the ex-cons was arrested on the job -- but that was after the slow-paced Italian courts sentenced him for a crime committed more than a decade ago. None of the convicts has committed any crime since the project started and the initial distrust has largely dissipated, said Alessandro Maria Vecchioni, head of an education agency that runs the scheme. He proudly showed letters of thanks from tourists helped by the guides and citizens' petitions to increase their numbers and hours. For now the guides work 20 hours a week for a monthly salary of euro500 ($725), paid by the Campania region with European Union funds. 'By escorting tourists to restaurants and shops in areas previously unsafe for visitors they help revive the area's economy, and then the locals are the first to turn against petty criminals,' Vecchioni said. Though it's too early to draw conclusions, Vecchioni said initial figures show crimes like muggings are down 85 percent in some of the areas covered by the guides. 'They bring customers and some extra safety,' said Salvatore Eder, who runs a food store in downtown Naples. 'There should be more of them.' "
1,"Two Senate Republicans, citing the severity of the nation's fiscal problems, said Thursday they would support a deficit reduction plan that would allow taxes to rise dramatically in coming years. The surprising endorsements from Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Mike Crapo of Idaho mean all three GOP senators on President Barack Obama's bipartisan deficit commission - the other is retiring Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire - have backed the group's proposals to rein in the mounting federal deficit. Coburn and Crapo said that despite the heartburn they share over elements of the package, they would sign onto it in hopes of spurring a serious effort to remedy the country's fiscal woes. 'Our debt crisis is a threat not just to our way of life but to our national survival,' Crapo told reporters Thursday in an appearance alongside Coburn. 'And the threat that we face is so real and so close that we do not have further time for gridlock or inaction. It's necessary that we take strong, aggressive action now.' The support from the trio of GOP senators means that at least half of the commission's 18 members, including lawmakers from both parties, plan to back the package when an official vote comes Friday. The group, chaired by former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., needs 14 votes to issue official recommendations. Crossing that threshold, however, remains unlikely. House Republicans Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Dave Camp of Michigan indicated Thursday that they would vote against the package, saying the recommendations fail to address rising health care costs and rely heavily on tax increases rather than restraints on spending. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, also has said he is inclined to vote against the package. In addition, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., another member of the panel, said Thursday he would vote against the plan because proposals such as cuts in pensions for military members and higher gas taxes 'hit rural America the hardest.' The commission's final plan recommends making sharp cuts to military spending and phasing in a higher retirement age. The package would raise taxes by nearly $1 trillion by 2020, primarily through moves that would eliminate or reduce long-standing credits, such as the home mortgage interest deduction. Meanwhile, the top income tax rate for both individuals and corporations would be dramatically lowered, from 35 percent to 29 percent or less. The report also recommends a legislative trigger that would raise taxes automatically unless a comprehensive overhaul is approved by 2013. The final package would balance the budget by 2035 and bring down the nation's debt to a manageable 41 percent of gross domestic product over the next 25 years. The co-chairmen resisted changes that would water down the far-reaching package. Simpson said this week that even if the package doesn't get the 14 votes necessary to prompt congressional consideration, the plan would succeed in changing the overall debate. 'Whether we get two votes or 18, this baby ain't goin' away,' he said. 'Oh, sure, it may be buried in an unmarked grave soon, but when the votes for the budget and to extend the debt limit and the debate on that comes up in the spring, this cadaver will rise from the crypt.' "
1,"Rep. Michele Bachmann's announcement Wednesday that she will seek a House leadership post broadcast loud and clear that she hopes to secure a prominent place for the emboldened tea party movement in Congress. But the news also seemed to contradict the definition of the tea party: the outsider, anti-government phenomenon that shook up the Republican Party this year and helped to oust dozens of incumbents across the country. As the founder of the Tea Party Caucus in the House and a favorite of the conservative movement, Bachmann, a two-term Republican from Minnesota, has embraced that outsider image. A a result, her bid to be the next GOP conference leader - the No. 4 leadership spot - highlights the question of how incoming House members and senators who prevailed Tuesday under the tea party banner will make the transition from outside the Republican Party to inside, from criticizing policy to making it, and from opposing the government to being part of it. The movement claimed three big wins in the Senate - Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania - and as many as 60 of the 83 new Republicans who will enter the House in January. They all have vowed to topple the existing order in Washington to one degree or another, by cutting taxes, repealing the health-care overhaul and shrinking the government. And in January, they will take their places among the thousands of other government employees in Washington. Not only must this new class of legislators reconcile their new role with their rhetoric, but they must also figure out how to put that rhetoric into action in an institution and a political party that have been the objects of their disdain. Tea party leaders such as Bachmann could exacerbate that strain by setting up a possible clash between the movement and top GOP leaders in the House. Her bid for conference leader came after House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia (the likely next majority leader) had endorsed Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Tex., for the job. Hensarling has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress, but he does not have the close association to the tea party that Bachmann does. Even in the unlikely scenario that Bachmann wins the post - she does not have seniority or a large following among her colleagues - the cajoling and bartering that comes with any party leadership job would seem anathema to the purist, no- compromises ethic of the tea party. Instead, the tea partiers-elect have continued to talk about what they won't tolerate. Since his victory, Paul has repeated his opposition to tax increases, federal spending and thousand-page bills. Rubio campaigned on the always reliable concept that 'Washington is broken,' but he hasn't spelled out in much detail what he intends to do now that he will be in a position to help fix it. Rep.-elect Tim Scott of coastal South Carolina said he doesn't think a fight with Republican leaders will be necessary, because he thinks they, too, will be ready to adhere to the limited-government principles of the tea party. Just-elected Renee Ellmers of North Carolina said she and other tea party members will serve as watchdogs to ensure that the party's policies adhere to the movement's priorities. But while the newcomers will be keeping an eye on the establishment, the tea partiers who elected them will be keeping an eye on them. A handful of national groups, including FreedomWorks and the Tea Party Patriots, plan to pay close attention to the way the new Congress, and its newest members, vote. Those who don't follow the principles of limited government and low taxes risk primary challenges in subsequent elections, organizers said. In the Senate, the tea party's influence is likely to be more muted. Although all six Republican newcomers there received some measure of backing from tea party groups, two of the movement's prominent stars - Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware - did not win Tuesday. A third, Joe Miller of Alaska, appeared headed to defeat against write-in candidate and GOP incumbent Lisa Murkowski. "
1,"BEIJING - If all goes according to plan, this fall a girl somewhere in China's Yunnan Province will tell her boyfriend she can't have sex with him. And he'll have an abstinence program from the United States to thank. In Yunnan schools this year, teachers are being trained with a sex education curriculum created by the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family. The agreement with the Yunnan ministry of education is a milestone for Focus on the Family, which has struggled for four years to make inroads on abstinence in China. It is also the result of a narrow confluence of interests: Evangelical Christian groups want an entree into China. And Chinese authorities, despite the country's official atheism, want help with controlling population growth and managing the society's rapidly shifting values. Chinese society has undergone major changes in recent decades, with divorce rates climbing steadily and migration and modernization putting increasing pressure on families, sociologists say. Wading into those waters, Focus on the Family has tried to market its marriage- and family-oriented programs as solutions. But Communist Party officials have been suspicious, at times, of the group's motivations. At an early demonstration of the abstinence curriculum two years ago - given to the Communist Youth League of China in Hangzhou - teens were supposed to end the seminar by making a virginity pledge, the hallmark of the Christian group's abstinence program. But government officials quickly stepped in, insisting that the kids pledge to no one but the Communist Party. 'It hasn't been easy,' said Deanna Go, China outreach director for the Colorado- based organization. 'Everything takes longer here.' Officials in Yunnan, however, said Focus on the Family's message of abstinence resonated with the province's conservative leadership. 'Nowadays, teen-agers have too many different channels for learning about sex,' said Ma Lianhong, Yunnan's former secretary general of media, who introduced the Christian group to provincial leaders. 'Even if you don't talk about it, they will just learn about it quietly by themselves, which is even more dangerous. ... Abstinence is good for keeping the families. steady and bringing down the divorce rate. And it complies with China's traditional morals.' Abstinence programs have generated considerable controversy in the United States and beyond. Critics point to research they say demonstrates that the approach is ineffective, and argue that efforts should be geared instead toward safe-sex education. But proponents say the strategy has the potential to reduce the rates of out-of-wedlock births and sexually transmitted diseases. In the past decade, Focus on the Family has found relative success with its abstinence program in other countries - notably majority Muslim nations such as Egypt and Malaysia, where its Christian brand of abstinence coincides with the teachings of Islam. Worldwide, the group says it has reached nearly 3 million teens. China, however, has proved a tough market to crack. Premarital sex has become common in its developed cities. Even in the more rural areas, experts say, sexual mores are changing at a rapid pace. Condom companies are vying to capture a lucrative share of China's population of 1.3 billion. The United Nations, HIV- prevention nonprofits and other groups are pouring millions into safe-sex programs. And abstinence, some say, is the last thing on Chinese teen-agers' minds. 'It's hard convincing them to come to our training,' said Qian Honglin, founder of a nonprofit working with Focus on the Family in Beijing. 'Their parents want them to come but young adults don't listen to their mothers. ... Once we get them in, however, it's easy for them to see the benefit.' The program, called 'No Apologies,' took two years for staff to translate into Chinese, and another two years to pass through government regulations. Before the Yunnan deal, the program was mostly taught at occasional seminars by associated nonprofits in four major cities. The piecemeal approach reached only 9,000 students, according to program coordinators. The new Yunnan agreement promises wider exposure. In the past week alone, 512 teachers from about half the school districts in the province were trained to teach the curriculum in seminars sponsored by the government. So how exactly did Focus on the Family sell the government on its program? Like most things in China, it required a little guanxi, a term that translates roughly as having the right connections. In 2006, Yunnan officials, who had heard some of the long-running 90-second radio commentaries by Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, inquired about airing them on their own station. That led provincial leaders to stop by Colorado during a 2007 tour of the United States. Provincial leaders told Dobson during their visit that they admired his strong stances on everything - marriage, parenting, gender issues, the sanctity of life. The only thing they disagreed with was evangelism, according to Go, the Focus on the Family official, who served as translator. That exchange explains how Yunnan teachers ended up being trained in two seminars this week on how to steer teens away from sex. The curriculum warns of consequences including STDs, teen-age pregnancy and abortion. It also offers women a myriad of ways to turn boys down, in Chinese: 'Do you want to bet my future on that condom?' 'I'm not like everyone else.' 'If you want to celebrate our love, bring me roses at 7 p.m. and let's go to dinner.' And, of course, there's the pledge. To work in China, however, Focus on the Family has had to make a pledge of its own: no politically sensitive material, and no religion. The evangelical group says it's strictly abiding by those terms. This week's seminar was mostly financed by the province, and Focus on the Family supplied the training. It is hard to say whether the program will make an impact. The same cultural battles that have made abstinence programs so controversial in U.S. schools now appear to be emerging in Yunnan. This week, just hours after the announcement of the new program in the local media, online commentators were criticizing the government for teaching abstinence rather than safe sex with condoms. Focus on the Family staff said the province had plans to pilot the abstinence curriculum at two school districts this fall, but on Thursday, provincial officials issued a statement saying the abstinence lessons will be used primarily to train teachers. Li Yinhe, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Science, said Chinese society is still adjusting to changing views on virginity. According to her research, premarital sex has jumped from 15 percent in 1989 to more than 50 percent. 'Now, women get married much later, so it's very hard to keep the virginity over a much longer time,' Li said. Go said Focus on the Family's program may be a tough sell for many in China, but said her goal is simply to let teen-agers know the option still exists. 'We want them to know that it doesn't matter what other people say or do,' she said. 'They are allowed to make their own choices.' Staff researcher Liu Liu in Beijing contributed to this report. "
1,"The plaintiff in the lawsuit that legalized abortion in the United States, who became an anti-abortion activist in recent years, has been arrested with three other protesters for disrupting Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court Senate confirmation hearing. Better known as 'Jane Roe,' 61-year-old Norma McCorvey began screaming during the opening statement of the newest senator, Democrat Al Franken. McCorvey's suit led to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that American women have a right to abortion. She later became an anti-abortion activist. McCorvey shouted that Sotomayor was 'wrong about abortion.' None of the questioning senators asked questions about the procedure. "
1,"Residents of big cities and rural areas are lagging in returning their census questionnaires, but at least two states and hundreds of smaller jurisdictions have already surpassed the rate they achieved in 2000, Census Bureau Director Robert Groves said Monday. About two in three households have responded so far, and this is the final week to mail back the 10-question census forms to avoid having a census taker come out, starting in May. On April 19, census officials will begin compiling a master list of addresses that did not respond. They expect to hire more than 700,000 census takers to make up to six personal visits so they can complete the count. Groves said North Carolina, with a 67 percent response rate, and South Carolina, at 66 percent, are each one percentage point ahead of their count for the last census, while Kentucky is on the verge of matching its 2000 rate of 70 percent. The national average is 65 percent. The areas where response rates are low include many rural areas, particularly in the South and the West. Much of the area along the Mexico-Texas border is below 50 percent. Groves said he is 'alarmed' at how big cities are doing. The 25 most populous cities in the country are all several percentage points below where they were in 2000, although they might make up the slack in the next two weeks. In Virginia, 69 percent have sent their forms back, compared with 73 percent at this point in 2000; Maryland is at 67 percent, compared with 74 percent in 2000; and in the District, 61 percent have responded, compared with 66 percent in 2000. Groves attributed low response rates to factors such as language barriers among new immigrants and the difficulty of counting rural households that use post office boxes, not mail addresses. But he said census officials can find no evidence of any impact from calls by some libertarians to boycott the census or answer only questions counting the number of people living in a household. Only 1 or 2 percent of the forms returned are partially complete, which is about what officials anticipated, he said. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., has said census questions have become too intrusive, and her family will not complete their census form completely. 'Look at Minnesota,' Groves said, referring to the census map showing that 74 percent of Minnesotans have returned their forms. Groves said the census, estimated to cost almost $15 billion, is under budget so far, though the final cost will depend on how many census takers have to be hired to look for people who don't mail in their questionnaires. He also said several census takers have been injured while venturing into campsites trying to count people living outdoors. Some of the sites have been booby-trapped on the perimeter, he said, and the census takers set off the traps when they approached. 'Some of the booby traps have caused gashes on their legs,' he said, adding that none of the injuries has been serious. "
1,The European Union's new justice chief says she is not convinced that European governments' transfer of personal banking data to U.S. authorities is necessary or effective in the fight against terrorism. The EU must this year renegotiate a controversial agreement to hand over huge amounts of banking information on Europeans that the U.S. says has given them some key leads in terrorist investigations. Viviane Reding also says in a Thursday speech that body scanners could invade personal privacy and were not proven to be useful. She says she cannot imagine the EU would use them widely without full consideration of their impact on health and personal privacy. 
1,"Unsold supplies of corn before next year's harvest will be 2.6 percent smaller than estimated a month ago, as demand for the grain to produce ethanol rises to a record, the government said Tuesday. The corn surplus on Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year, will be 1.719 billion bushels, down from 1.764 billion forecast in January and up from 1.673 billion a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said Tuesday in a report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected inventories of 1.747 billion bushels, on average. 'Corn used to make ethanol has been underestimated,' said Jerry Gidel, a market analyst for North American Risk Management Services in Chicago. 'Rising sugar prices are reducing Brazil's excess supplies of ethanol,' potentially increasing U.S. exports, Gidel said before the report. The amount of corn to be used to produce ethanol will be 4.3 billion bushels, up from the January estimate of 4.2 billion. A year earlier, a record 3.677 billion bushels were used for the biofuel. Smaller inventories may raise costs for processors of corn-based ethanol such as Archer Daniels Midland and for meat companies including Smithfield Foods and Tyson Foods, which say corn-based animal feed is their biggest expense. The USDA's estimate of 13.151 billion bushels for the 2009 crop was unchanged from last month and up 8.8 percent from 12.092 billion bushels in 2008. The government is scheduled to release its final estimate for last year's harvest on March 10 and its first forecast for this year's crop later this month. Corn exports will total 2 billion bushels by Aug. 31, down from 2.05 billion forecast in January and up from 1.858 billion bushels in the previous marketing year, the USDA said. About 5.55 billion bushels will be used for animal feed, the department said, unchanged from last month's estimate. The USDA estimated world corn production in the 2009- 2010 season, which began Oct. 1, at 797.8 million metric tons, up from 796.5 million tons forecast in January, on increased production in Argentina. A year earlier, global production was a record 791.5 million tons. China, the second-largest corn producer, will harvest 155 million tons, unchanged from January's forecast and down from a record 165.9 million tons a year ago, the department said. Global consumption will reach 809.7 million tons, up from 806.2 million estimated last month and an increase from 775.2 million last year, the USDA said. It would be the first time in three years that world consumption exceeds production. World inventories before the next harvest in the Northern Hemisphere will total 134 million tons, down from 136.2 million tons estimated in January and less than 145.9 million in the previous year.

1,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says the economic recovery probably won't quickly bring down the unemployment rate, which is likely to stay 'high for a while.' Given the depth of the recession, the recovery is 'moderate paced,' Bernanke said Monday night in a question-and- answer session with Sam Donaldson, the ABC News journalist, in Washington. In Europe, policy makers 'are committed to avoiding default in Greece' and elsewhere, he said. While the Fed will raise interest rates from a record low before the economy returns to 'full employment,' Bernanke said officials don't know when that process will start. The banking system isn't fully healthy and lenders are 'cautious' in providing credit, he said. 'The unemployment rate is still going to be high for a while, and that means that a lot of people are going to be under financial stress,' Bernanke said at the event, part of a dinner hosted by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Tuesday that monetary policy is 'appropriately, very accommodative' and that consumer spending will grow and inflation will be stable. Bernanke's stance is consistent with that of several Fed colleagues. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said last week that the central bank may need to raise rates even with 'unacceptable levels of unemployment,' while Eric Rosengren of the Boston Fed said last month it wouldn't be 'appropriate' to have rates close to zero with the economy at full employment. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig, the longest- serving Fed policy maker, is calling for an increase in the federal funds rate target to 1 percent even sooner, within a few months. Traders don't expect the Fed to start raising rates until the first quarter of 2011, based on futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last week, Bernanke said he's concerned about the toll that joblessness is taking on Americans. The jobless rate, which fell to 9.7 percent last month from 9.9 percent, was 4.6 percent at the start of the financial crisis in August 2007. At the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on April 27- 28, policy makers raised their growth estimates for 2010 and lowered forecasts for unemployment and inflation. Officials said the economy will expand in a range of 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent this year, and the jobless rate will average 9.1 percent to 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Bernanke and his colleagues will give updated economic projections when they next meet in Washington June 22-23. The Fed chief reiterated Monday that the central bank's 'extended period' of a record low interbank lending rate is conditioned on high unemployment, low inflation and stable price expectations. 'We have right now a very accommodative, very easy monetary policy,' Bernanke said. 'We can't wait until unemployment is where we'd like it to be' or inflation gets 'out of control' to tighten credit, he said. European finance ministers this week put the finishing touches on a rescue fund backed by $526 billion in national guarantees, seeking to halt the spread of Greece's debt crisis. The Fed last month restarted emergency currency-swap lines with central banks around the world. 'It's a lot of money,' Bernanke said of the European plan. 'It certainly covers the obligations of Greece and Portugal and Spain for a number of years.' He said 'there still needs to be work done,' and 'investors aren't completely convinced' the problems are resolved. "
1,"AS Roma coach Luciano Spalletti appears on his way out at AS Roma after opening the Serie A season with two losses and Claudio Ranieri is already being tipped as a replacement. Roma opened with a 3-2 loss to Genoa and was beaten 3-1 by Juventus on Sunday. Spalletti, who earns euro3.6 million (US$5.1 million) per season and has a contract through June, 2011, was due to meet with Roma president Rosella Sensi on Tuesday. Financially struggling Roma is unlikely to fire him, meaning Spalletti will probably attempt to rescind his contract by mutual consent with the club or resign, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. Ranieri was fired as Juventus' coach with two games remaining last season. The Rome-born coach has also guided Fiorentina, Valencia and Chelsea. Ranieri began his playing career with Roma, but only appeared in six games over two seasons. Spalletti is in his fifth season with Roma, having won two Italian Cups and one Italian Super Cup. Roma was runner-up in Serie A in Spalletti's first three seasons, but the Giallorossi finished sixth last season and out of the Champions League places. Spalletti has never been truly satisfied with Roma's efforts in the transfer market, and the club is still largely dependent on captain Francesco Totti, who turns 33 later this month. In the final hours of the summer transfer window on Monday, Roma made only a modest showing by signing two players on loan -- Romania goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont from Dinamo Bucharest and 19-year-old forward Fabio Zamblare from Newcastle. "
1,"Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley hired JPMorgan Chase investment banker Gene Saffold and gave him a simple order: protect the taxpayer. 'During these tough times, when people are hurting, this is more important than ever,' Daley said in introducing the city's new chief financial officer in March 2009. 'We must be creative and bold in our thinking as we better manage government.' Not much has changed. Saffold is sticking with the city's more than two-decade tradition of shunning open bidding for Chicago's long-term debt, selling $2 billion in bonds through private negotiations with banks. Arranging competitive auctions instead would save taxpayers millions of dollars, according to internal documents and a review of bond sales by the country's third-largest municipality. Efforts to introduce competition fail because the city and its aldermen want to reward those who support public officials and politically connected charities, said a former investment banker in Chicago. 'Firms get chosen to be negotiated underwriters as payback,' said J.B. Kurish, now an associate dean at Emory University's business school in Atlanta. The city, which requires public bids for any other purchase of more than $100,000, faces the worst financial crisis of Daley's 21-year tenure. He closed a $520 million deficit in the current budget by tapping a reserve fund from a 75-year lease of parking meters, putting workers on unpaid furlough days and eliminating funding for civic traditions such as Venetian Night, a lakefront festival Daley's father started as mayor more than 50 years ago. Eighty-five percent of the $378 billion of long-term municipal bond deals last year were negotiated privately, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Breaking Chicago from that habit proved challenging for one of Saffold's predecessors. 'I accomplished a lot of things in my time in Chicago, but getting the city to go competitive was not one of them,' said Dana Levenson, now head of North American infrastructure banking at Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Chicago office. 'It's something that would have benefited the city of Chicago greatly if it had gone competitive.' Saffold, 55, defended the use of negotiated sales in a Dec. 4 interview in Bloomberg's Chicago bureau. 'We've gotten effective pricing, especially if you look at us compared to other state and local governments,' he said. 'You don't get best pricing because you have done a competitive bid.' One of the city's own advisers found otherwise. Six weeks after the interview, Kristina Eng of the New York office of A.C. Advisory Inc. sent a memo to Chicago's finance department. It showed how $500 million of a Jan. 11 bond sale yielded more than half a percentage point more than a comparable Pennsylvania issue sold competitively. On a taxable portion of the issue, Chicago paid 152 basis points more than a benchmark Treasury rate while Pennsylvania paid 80 basis points over Treasuries, according to the memo. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The Pennsylvania issue may have won a better spread in part because its bonds matured six years earlier than Chicago's and had a rating one level higher from two of three credit evaluators, Eng wrote. Fitch Ratings graded them both AA. She declined to comment on the memo, which was obtained through an open records request. Saffold spoke on behalf of the administration, said Lance Lewis, a spokesman for Daley. The city chose a negotiated approach for the January issue because of its complexity, Saffold said last week in response to written questions. 'To then attribute the pricing difference to the method of sale is both inappropriate and misleading,' he said. Saffold, an investment banker with 25 years of experience, said he prefers having the city hire a pool of banks to find buyers for its bonds, with interest rates set by consulting with underwriters. 'I'm a proponent of negotiated sales,' Saffold said. 'Cost isn't the sole objective.' Chicago's negotiated sales haven't weakened the city's finances, he said. Such sales allow the city to react to changing market conditions and boost participation of minority- owned firms when the city selects underwriters, he said. Levenson, the city's CFO from 2004 to 2007 and chairman of its Commission to Strengthen Chicago's Pension Funds, said he was thwarted when he recommended at least twice that the city use competitive sales. The Chicago-based Government Finance Officers Association recommends competitive sales for bonds rated A or better, including those backed by secure revenue sources with structures that don't require extensive explanation to buyers. Negotiated sales are best suited for those rated below A or with unusual features, according to the association. Some states require a portion of municipal bonds to be competitively bid. Illinois law sets a minimum of 25 percent for most of its bonds, said Kelly Kraft, a spokeswoman for the governor's Office of Management and Budget. Municipal bonds don't fall under Chicago's procurement policy that requires competition when it buys goods and services costing more than $100,000. The finance department chooses the underwriters with the approval of the city council, Saffold said. Chicago avoids bidding out its bond deals because investment bankers in the city donate to charities and political campaigns, said a former city official with knowledge of the process. Many local politicians fear damaging that relationship by asking banks to compete for Chicago's bond business, the former official said. Saffold said industry and city rules prohibit making contributions in exchange for underwriting work. The city 'does not participate in pay-to-play selection processes,' he said. Daley announced Saffold's hiring last year by saying he is 'ideally suited to help us maintain our commitment to sound management and fiscal responsibility.' Saffold, JPMorgan's managing director for national accounts at the time, had headed the company's public finance investment banking group. While at JPMorgan, he worked with the mayor's brother, William M. Daley, the bank's head of corporate responsibility. Saffold, who grew up on Chicago's South Side, is a former member of the Chicago Board of Education. The January bond deal examined by Eng, the financial adviser, isn't the only recent example of competitively bid issues proving cheaper than Chicago's. The city paid about one-third of a percentage point more when it sold $128.8 million of insured O'Hare International Airport bonds April 12, compared with a lower-rated issue sold through bidding by the Florida Department of Transportation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. During the 20-year life of the bonds, that translates to about $8.2 million in additional interest payments. The bonds were part of a $1 billion no-bid issue in which the city paid $7.9 million, including a $5.3 million underwriting fee, to banks led by Bank of America Corp., according to bond documents. Saffold said, as with the January bond issue, that attributing the price difference to the method of sale was 'misleading.' Savings from competitive deals would help Chicago plug revenue holes left by declines in real estate and income tax collections as well as the loss of convention business to warmer, less expensive cities such as Orlando, Florida, and Las Vegas. In March, the city met with more than 90 bankers and other financial advisers to present a request for qualifications for firms wanting to help it address its budget challenges. Chicago was looking for 'creative financing ideas and techniques that may help ensure the fiscal health of the city in 2011,' according to a news release. The city's purchase agreements for recent negotiated deals don't require underwriters to adhere to performance standards for obtaining the lowest borrowing cost, according to the documents obtained under open-records requests. Even cities such as Los Angeles that mostly sell without bids sometimes use competitive deals to make firms earn the negotiated underwritings, said Daniel Kaplan, president of Kaplan Financial Consulting Inc. in Wilmette, Illinois. 'It helps to do a mix of both,' said Kaplan. 'Chicago is the extreme of issuers that don't do any.' Saffold said he can show taxpayers that the city's approach leads to the lowest borrowing cost. 'The information is out there,' he said. 'Call the city of Chicago department of finance, and they can get whatever information that they're looking for. Ask for Gene Saffold.' Bloomberg News reported in December that the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, an agency independent of the city, paid $8 million in unnecessary interest when it issued $354.3 billion of bonds in August through a negotiated sale. Cities and states that negotiate don't borrow at the lowest cost for taxpayers in the $2.8 trillion U.S. municipal bond market, said Craig Brown, an assistant professor of finance at City University of New York who has surveyed research in his study of borrowing costs. Research findings put the difference at 17 to 48 basis points, according to a 2008 article in the Municipal Finance Journal by Mark D. Robbins, associate professor, and William Simonsen, professor, at the University of Connecticut. Matching Wits 'Finance officers are persuaded they can match wits with the underwriters they work with and negotiate a better sale than competitive bids can provide,' Robbins said in an interview. The city officials are 'just trying to get a transaction done. Cost is less of a consideration.' A negotiated deal restricts a city's ability to force underwriters to offer the lowest interest rates or show taxpayers it got the best price, said Ralph Martire, executive director for the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a non-partisan group in Chicago. 'There is no way it could be in the public's interest to do a no-bid deal on a bond,' Martire said. 'There is no way you can win.' Preston reported from Dallas. Brendan A. McGrail in New York contributed. "
1,"President Hamid Karzai took key steps toward reforming the country's electoral system Saturday, naming a respected former judge to head Afghanistan's election-organizing body and backing down from a bid to keep international representatives off a separate team that monitors fraud. The moves come after months of demands by the U.S. and its allies to clean up the electoral process following massive fraud in last year's presidential balloting. Without meeting those demands, the Afghan government risked losing both funds for an upcoming parliamentary vote and broader international support. Disagreements about how to handle last year's fraud-marred presidential vote nearly derailed the U.S.-Afghan partnership, even as President Barack Obama was ordering thousands more U.S. troops to try to turn back the Taliban. Many international diplomats and officials have been worried that parliamentary elections scheduled for September could prove similarly disastrous. The U.N. said it was now recommending that donor nations release money set aside to fund the parliamentary vote. Karzai also named three Afghans and two U.N. representatives to the separate, U.N.-backed watchdog group that uncovered the fraud in the Aug. 20 presidential election. Last February, Karzai issued a presidential decree excluding foreigners from the watchdog. But the lower house of parliament threw out the decree. Presidential spokesman Waheed Omar said Karzai had agreed to include two U.N. representatives to address the concerns of the international community. Omar said the watchdog will not be able to make decisions without the agreement of at least one of the international representatives -- a South African and an Iraqi nominated by the United Nations. The chief of the U.N. mission, Staffan de Mistura, said that with the changes, he believed the Sept. 18 parliamentary elections would be 'more credible, more transparent' than the presidential election last year. However, it's unclear if Karzai's most recent appointments will result in a more transparent vote, or simply be the latest attempt to paper over an entrenched system of cronyism and vote-trading by giving the appearance of a democratic election. Karzai has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing on the part of the officials he appointed to run last year's election, at times even accusing the U.N. and international advisers of being behind the fraud. Those comments drew sharp rebukes from the White House and the United Nations. The new chairman of the Independent Election Commission is Fazel Ahmed Manawi, an Islamic scholar who joined the opposition Northern Alliance after Kabul fell to the Taliban in 1996 and took part in talks to form a new government after the U.S.-led invasion drove them from power in 2001. As an electoral commissioner last year, Manawi was not considered as closely tied to Karzai as his predecessor, Azizullah Lodin. Lodin said last year that he saw no conflict of interest in briefing the president on discussions between the commission and the U.N.-backed watchdog body, the Electoral Complaints Commission, as it was investigating fraud allegations. The complaints body threw out nearly a third of Karzai's votes, forcing him into a runoff with his top challenger, Abdullah Abdullah. Karzai was proclaimed the winner after Abdullah dropped out of the runoff, saying he was not convinced the second ballot would be fairer than the first. Lodin said this month that he did not want a second term as head of the commission. Another top election official accused of ignoring fraud submitted his resignation at the same time. A representative of Abdullah, Fazel Sancharaki, called Manawi's appointment 'a positive step,' saying he had a reputation for impartiality when he served as a judge on the Supreme Court and for fair judgments as an election commissioner. 'Of course we accept and we are doing so with satisfaction,' de Mistura said of Manawi's appointment. 'Everything we hear is that the person chosen -- Mr. Manawi -- is a very solid person who we can all feel comfortable with.' Also Saturday, two NATO service members were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, the alliance said without disclosing nationalities. Their deaths bring to at least 23 the number of international troops killed so far this month. In northern Afghanistan, NATO and Afghan security forces, assisted with reconnaissance and air support from the international force, were in their third day of an operation to deny insurgents' access to populated areas of Baghlan province. Gen. Ghulam Mushtaba Patang, regional commander of the Afghan National Police, said the operation was under way in a handful of villages where troops have confiscated weapons and defused mines. Five Afghan workers for the U.N. Office of Project Services were taken hostage Thursday in Baghlan, about 120 miles (190 kilometers) north of the capital, Kabul. The U.N. is working with the Afghan Ministry of Interior to seek their release. ---- Associated Press Writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report. "
1,"NEW YORK - The Met finally got one right. And it was a tough one. It takes a bunch of really good singers to bring off Verdi's 'Don Carlo,' with voices loud enough to drown out the drone of us opera-lovers mourning the decline of Verdi- singing in the modern age. Admittedly, not all of the singers at the 'Don Carlo' premiere on Monday night were actually able to change our minds. But there was enough solid singing, and Nicholas Hytner's production -- his first at the Met -- was good enough to make a satisfying evening of opera. Or maybe I just love 'Don Carlo' so much that I'm willing to be optimistic about the proverbial half- full glass. Hytner adopted what I suspect is becoming a formula for European directors approaching the Metropolitan Opera: the 'put them in traditional costumes and create slightly stylized sets' plan of attack. (Luc Bondy is still fine-tuning that one.) The sets, by Bob Crowley (also in a Met debut), ranged from servicable to evocative, starting with stylized white trees in the snowscape of Fontainebleau (where the opera's five-act version opens) and extending to a dark space shot through with shafts of smoky light, the vault of the monastery of St. Just, dramatically awe-full. A forbidding wall pierced with small square windows descended between scenes, repeatedly shutting Carlo out of the spaces where the action played. Some of the stylization was a little trite (the female chorus sported big fur cuffs in the Fontainebleau scene, bright red fans in the red- and-black garden scene), and King Philip's cavernous study seemed like a half- finished idea, but the general idiom of big dark spaces, large columns, military severity was effective. The real reason it worked, though, was Hytner's attention to the characters. It's always hard to know how much inspiration comes from a director and how much from the singer: Ferruccio Furlanetto, who has become one of the great portrayers of King Philip and whose 'Ella giammai m'amo' monologue at the opening of Act IV was stunning, had some of the same tender, telling touches on Monday that he showed in live broadcast of La Scala's opening night in 2008. After accusing his wife, Elisabetta, of adultery, he grabs her fainted body and cradles her head, pouring out all the affection he can't figure out how to give her when she's conscious. But Hytner certainly had a hand in it. And his conception of Elisabetta was one of the best things in the opera. The future Queen burst onto the scene at the very start of the opera, a strong-willed, loose-haired tomboy princess with a hunting rifle, beautiful and proud and free. She met Carlo, fell wildly in love, and then learned she had been betrothed to his father; you could see the walls of duty closing in around her as for the first time in her life she couldn't do exactly what she wanted. Marina Poplavskaya embodied this free spirit, and her subsequent proud sad life at the Spanish court, so convincingly, and sang with such a lovely tone -- round and supple and warm -- that you could sometimes overlook the fact that the part was clearly two sizes too big for her. She couldn't fake this in the big passages, though she tried to temper her delivery of the big final aria, 'Tu che le vanita,' with artistry and sophisticated pianos. I hate to keep harping on a theme in my writing about the Met, but the company here yet again has chosen a voice that's too small for the role, but that I predict will sound great in the HD broadcast (scheduled for December 11). Vocally, the evening was sustained by Furlanetto and Roberto Alagna, who as Don Carlo sounded ragged in his opening aria but quickly sang his way into a firmer, ringing delivery -- a little tinny at times, and a little rough at others, but overall thoroughly respectable. Simon Keenlyside's Posa was more a work in progress. Here's another singer who doesn't quite have the vocal heft for the role, though he came to it with both beauty and artistry. (Posa's love for Carlo in this production extended beyond mere battlefield camaraderie.) Keenlyside overcompensated for vocal lightness with a kind of physical restlessness that's become widespread among many of the Met's so-called 'singing actors.' There's been a lot of criticism of the old-school approach of 'park and bark' around the Met in the last few years, but the ability to keep still on stage conveys a kind of authority and strength that lots of gestures seldom achieve -- as Furlanetto's King Philip abundantly demonstrated in his magisterial Act II duet with Keenlyside's shifting Posa.

1,"The United States announced Thursday that four of Europe's five biggest oil companies would end their energy investments in Iran, a significant advance in the Obama administration's efforts to pressure the Iranian government to enter negotiations over its alleged nuclear weapons program. At the same time, U.S. officials said they were working to pressure China and other countries to bar their companies from filling the vacuum created by the departing Europeans. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said Royal Dutch Shell, based in Britain and the Netherlands; France's Total; Eni of Italy, and the Norway-based Statoil had committed to no further investments in Iran. 'These companies have provided assurances they will stop or are taking significant verifiable steps to stop their activity in Iran,' Steinberg said. He also announced that the United States was slapping sanctions on a subsidiary of an Iranian oil company in Switzerland. Steinberg's announcement marked the first public actions since the United States tightened sanctions against Iran on July 1 ,when President Barack Obama signed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act into law. Since enhanced U.N. sanctions were authorized against Iran in June, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Norway and Australia have passed legislation further targeting Iran's economy and energy sector. Iran says its nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Among the other moves announced Thursday, the State Department said European and Kuwaiti firms along with Russia's Lukoil, India's Reliance and Turkey's Turpras have stopped or promised to stop selling gasoline and other refined products to Iran. British Petroleum and Shell said they are no longer supplying jet fuel to Iran Air. And Lloyd's of London announced it would not insure or reinsure petroleum shipments going into Iran. While Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has said the effect of the sanctions so far has been 'pathetic,' Steinberg contended they had begun to bite. 'We have pretty good indications,' he said, 'that whether it's in the financial sector, whether it's in shipping and transportation, that these measures are increasingly having a significant impact on Iran. There's no question that . . . their ability to do business is being hindered in lots of different ways.' The four European oil companies are not the only ones committing to ending investment in Iran. Japanese officials said earlier this week that the Japanese oil giant Inpex was readying an announcement that it, too, would halt its investments in Iran's largest onshore energy project, the Azadegan oil fields. Japan obtains one-fourth of its oil from Iran. U.S. officials had threatened to place Inpex on a sanctions watch list if the firm did not end its business in Iran. Steinberg also announced that the State Department would begin investigating other oil companies that had not committed to winding up their Iranian investments. Among those companies, sources said, are China's oil firms, such as the China National Offshore Oil Co., China National Petroleum and Sinopec. Robert Einhorn, a senior U.S. official, has been in Beijing this week with a delegation from the Treasury and State departments to persuade China not to engage in, as Steinberg put it, 'backfill.' Asked specifically about China, Steinberg replied: 'Without mentioning specific countries or companies, we have made clear to all of . . . our international partners that we are strongly discouraging' those companies from increasing their investments in Iran while other firms back out. Japanese officials have told their U.S. counterparts that they are particularly concerned that as Inpex exits the Azadegan oil field, Chinese companies will step into the breach. Iran is China's third-biggest supplier of oil, after Angola and Saudi Arabia. Chinese state-owned oil companies have signed memorandums committing to invest more than $100 billion in Iran's energy sector over the past few years, although only a small fraction of those funds have been invested. Chinese companies have a history of moving in on projects that Western and Japanese firms have left dangling. In June 2009, China National Petroleum signed a $5 billion contract with National Iranian Oil to develop the massive South Pars gas field, after the Iranians accused French oil producer Total of delaying the project. And last year China National Petroleum reportedly agreed to invest around $2 billion to develop the South Azadegan fields in place of Inpex, which had cut its share. In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday, Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John Kyl, R-Ariz., pushed for sanctions against three Chinese companies for continuing to do business with Iran. Some diplomats questioned whether the United States has the stomach to sanction major Chinese companies given the sensitive nature of Washington's relations with Beijing. The Obama administration is focused on trying to convince China to allow its currency to appreciate against the dollar. Ties with China's military, which have been suspended for months, are only just resuming. And, diplomats said, there are questions about whether the threat of U.S. sanctions would actually worry China's oil giants. They have little business in the United States. One of the firms active in Iran, the China National Offshore Oil Corp., or CNOOC, was stopped from buying the U.S. oil firm Unocal in 2005. 'The goal here is not to impose sanctions for sanctions' sake but to end companies from doing business with Iran,' Steinberg said. However, he added, 'if we conclude that that cannot be done and under the requirements of the law that we need to impose sanctions, we will do it.' "
1,"U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says any attempts to obstruct U.N. operations in Ivory Coast are 'totally unacceptable' and warns that any attacks on U.N. forces in the African nation will be considered attacks on the international community. Ban told a news conference at U.N. headquarters on Friday that people responsible for the loss of civilian lives in post-electoral violence in the African nation will be held accountable as the situation in the country takes 'a dangerous turn.' The U.N. chief is calling on presidential candidate Laurent Gbago to step aside for opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara, whose electoral victory has been accepted by the world. He says attempts by Gbago so stay in power cannot stand. "
1,"A redheaded horsewoman in a flowing, made-to-measure Islamic gown atop a snorting steed opened what can only be deemed Paris' most unusual fashion show of late. The display, a sumptuous affair held Thursday at the French capital's George V Hotel, showcased haute couture abayas, the body-covering black robes some Muslim women don over their clothing in public and required in Saudi Arabia. They are usually accompanied by a headscarf and can be worn with a niqab, a face veil covering all but the eyes. Designers who tried their hand at making over the abaya included Christian Dior's artistic director John Galliano, French luxury labels Nina Ricci and Jean Claude Jitrois and Italian houses Blumarine and Alberta Feretti. The show began with a bang, as the carrot-topped cavaliere -- decked out in a Galliano-designed abaya exploding with firework of colored sequins and dangling fringe -- rode her mount into the hotel's subterranean salon. Twenty models followed on foot, wearing abayas heavy with rhinestones or airy in gauzy fabrics. 'I realized that most of the Saudi clients are wearing designer brands, but they're covered by a black abaya,' said the show's organizer, Dania Tarhini, general manager of Saks Fifth Avenue in Saudi Arabia. 'It is an obligation to wear the abaya there, but let them feel good about it.' The timing of the Paris show was propitious: Four days earlier, French President Nicolas Sarkozy struck a nerve in the Muslim world by declaring that full-body veils such as the burqa are 'not welcome' in France, saying they make women prisoners. A top Muslim group in Britain called Sarkozy 'patronizing and offensive.' Lebanon's most influential Shiite cleric called on Sarkozy to reconsider his comments. Tarhini, a striking brunette of Lebanese origin who's lived in Saudi Arabia for the past seven years, acknowledged 'it wasn't easy' to convince designers to take part in the project. At first, 'they couldn't imagine how to make a designer abaya,' she told The Associated Press in an interview. 'I explained to them the concept is to (make women) look good and also to promote their brands .... Then they accepted.' Tarhini said the initial batch of made-to-measure abayas -- worth between euro4,000-euro8,000 ($5,500-$11,150) -- would be given as presents to Saks' most faithful Saudi clients. Ready-to-wear versions of the robes by the 21 designers featured in the Paris show are expected to go on sale in Saks stores the Saudi Arabian cities of Jeddah and Riyadh in September. The gowns, which are to retail for euro1,800 ($2,500), could later be sold in the store's branches in neighboring Bahrain and Dubai, Tarhini said. Saks' senior vice president for international business ventures, David Pilnick, said the project aims to build bridges between cultures. 'In countries like Saudi Arabia they have to wear these plain, very conservative garments and that's not going to change, so it's nice to have fashion,' he said in an interview after the show. Most of the gowns on display Thursday adhered to standards considered appropriate for wear in Saudi Arabia: All were black, most were floor-length and many had a built-in head covering or matching veil. The few translucent models, like a bell-sleeved gown embroidered with white and yellow flowers by Venezuelan designer Carolina Herrera, were meant to be worn over evening gowns, Tarhini said. 'Everybody's waiting for a change in a good way,' Tarhini said. Some women in Saudi Arabia 'don't want to feel obliged (to wear the abaya). They want to wear it to look fashionable, as well.' "
1,"Charlie Wilson, the hard-partying congressman whose exploits on behalf of the mujahedeen resistance fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan formed the basis of the book and movie 'Charlie Wilson's War,' has died. He was 76. He died Wednesday at a hospital in Lufkin, Texas, of cardiopulmonary arrest, according to statement from Memorial Health System of East Texas. He received a heart transplant in 2007. A Democrat representing an impoverished area in rural Texas, Wilson held his House seat from 1973 to 1996. He was 'one of the most distinctive figures in the House,' the Almanac of American Politics put it in the 1990s -- 'tall, almost spectrally thin, flamboyant, pleasure-loving, always ready with a wisecrack or quip, yet also serious-minded when he wants to be and even idealistic.' He homed in on what would become his signature cause in 1982, on a fact-finding trip to the Mideast. After visits to Israel and Lebanon, he tacked on a stop in Pakistan at the behest of a wealthy political backer, Joanne Herring. Tom Hanks portrayed Wilson, and Julia Roberts played Herring, in the film version of 'Charlie Wilson's War' (2007). The movie showed how Wilson's 1982 visit to Pakistan would become Herring's great triumph. A glamorous fixture of Houston society, Herring had years earlier swept Wilson 'from the Bible Belt into her dazzling world of black-tie dinners, movie stars, countesses, Saudi princes and big-time Republican oil magnates,' George Crile wrote in the 2003 book that was turned into the movie. Herring was a staunch conservative, part of a secret organization dedicated to fighting the possibility of a communist takeover of America, Crile wrote. She became passionate about Pakistan, which she considered a bulwark against Soviet expansionism, especially after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. Wilson was among the powerful friends she tried to recruit to Pakistan's defense. On his 1982 visit, the congressman met with military leaders who detailed the Soviet occupation, the resulting refugee crisis and Pakistan's need for state- of-the-art radar for its U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, according to Crile's account. Before returning home, Wilson made the first of what would become 14 visits to Peshawar, center of the Afghan resistance and home to sprawling refugee camps. 'It began to dawn on me right then and there that I didn't know what was going to happen, but with my rage and their courage I knew we were going to kill some Russians,' Wilson told Crile, who died in 2006. Over the next several years, Wilson used his seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, and the secrecy of the U.S. covert-operations budget, to send billions of dollars in arms to the Afghan rebels. The arms ultimately included Stinger missiles, which the rebels used to shoot down theretofore unchallenged Soviet helicopters. Soviet troops left Afghanistan in 1989 after 10 years of fighting. Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq, interviewed by '60 Minutes' about how the powerful Soviets had been defeated, answered: 'All I can say is, Charlie did it.' The story, of course, didn't end there. Power struggles in Afghanistan were eventually won by Islamic fundamentalists who would give safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and his followers, who would attack the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. Wilson said the power vacuum in Afghanistan that followed the Soviet retreat was an unforeseen result of a worthy fight against communism. He told Time magazine in 2007, 'Who the hell had ever heard of the Taliban then?' Charles Nesbitt Wilson was born on June 1, 1933, in Trinity, Texas, about 90 miles north of Houston. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1956 and served in the Navy until 1960, including some time on a destroyer searching for Soviet submarines. Back in Texas, he ran a lumber business and won election to the state House of Representatives, then to the state Senate. In 1972, he ran successfully for Congress. He built a record of siding with northern liberals on economic issues while leaning toward hawkish views on foreign policy. Wilson outmaneuvered a fellow Texan to win a seat on the Appropriations Committee, which controls federal spending, and then secured a slot on its subcommittee on foreign operations. Before his passion for the mujahedeen surfaced, he seemed 'more interested in promoting, aggressively, the interests of Texas defense contractors,' the Almanac of American Politics wrote in its 1984 edition. He became famous on Capitol Hill for, among other things, a team of young, female office staffers known as 'Charlie's Angels.' Wilson was part-owner of a Washington nightclub called Elan and was the subject of a 1978 Washington Post profile titled 'Charles Wilson: Every Day's a Party for Him.' He had arrived in Washington with a wife, but they soon divorced. A criminal probe into drug use on Capitol Hill led by Rudolph Giuliani -- at the time a little-known Justice Department attorney -- ensnared Wilson for a time. Investigators looked into reports that Wilson had used cocaine in 1980, while in a hot tub in Las Vegas with two showgirls wearing only high heels. Wilson told Crile that yes, he was in that hot tub, and yes, those two showgirls snorted cocaine from their long red fingernails. He added, 'The feds spent a million bucks trying to figure out whether, when those fingernails passed under my nose, did I inhale or exhale -- and I ain't telling.' Wilson held a 'Beat the Rap Party' in 1983 when Giuliani's team gave up its efforts to charge him, the Washington Post reported. After 12 two-year terms, Wilson stepped down in October 1996. He became a lobbyist and represented the government of Pakistan, among other clients. He spent 40 days on a waiting list before undergoing lifesaving transplant surgery in September 2007. He was well enough to fly to Hollywood that December to attend the premiere of the movie based on his life. Wilson's second marriage, in 1999, was to Barbara Alberstadt, a former ballerina. "
1,"Reports of Nicolas Anelka's expletive-filled tirade at coach Raymond Domenech has highlighted mounting tension within France's World Cup squad. French sports daily L'Equipe reported Saturday that Anelka insulted Domenech at half time during France's 2-0 loss to Mexico on Thursday when the coach offered him some tactical advice. L'Equipe said that Domenech snapped after being insulted by Anelka, who was then replaced by Andre-Pierre Gignac. Anelka was snubbed by Domenech four years ago when he did not make the World Cup squad, even when striker Djibril Cisse was injured on the eve of the team's departure to Germany. Domenech took Sidney Govou instead in 2006. But the Chelsea striker was a starter in all the warmup matches before this World Cup, and he also started France's opening match, which finished 0-0 against Uruguay. The latest reports of a rift follow newspaper allegations that midfielder Yoann Gourcuff is an unpopular figure in the squad and that defender William Gallas is upset with Domenech for giving the captain's armband to Patrice Evra. Calls made to the France team's press officer seeking comment on the reported bust-up between Anelka and Domenech were not immediately returned. Only a handful of French players spoke to the press after the Mexico defeat left the French staring at possible elimination. France needs to beat South Africa convincingly on Tuesday, and hope Mexico and Uruguay don't draw their final game, to have any chance of qualifying for the second round. 'We deserve the criticism,' France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan said Friday. 'Despite what was said, I think there were a lot of supporters who had hope. We owe it to ourselves to fight for these people.' Gallas is refusing to speak to reporters for the duration of the competition, while Franck Ribery, Anelka and Thierry Henry -- all mainstays of the team -- have also not spoken so far. Toulalan, one of only a few players to speak after the Mexico match, fears that the team is now a collection of individual talents with no teamwork whatsoever. Toulalan added that 'everyone has to do their own self-analysis' and that things will only improve if 'everyone is honest (with themselves) and understands what they did (well) or did not do (well).' Toulalan is close friends with Gourcuff, but he would not be drawn on squabbles within the squad. Some reports have alleged that Gourcuff sometimes eats alone at the dinner table, and that Ribery and Anelka do not like him and pressured Domenech to drop him against Mexico. Gourcuff was replaced by Florent Malouda, and did not play any part in the match. In the opening game against Uruguay, Anelka had a clear chance to pass to the unmarked Gourcuff during the first half but chose not to, prompting an angry reaction from Gourcuff who threw his arms up in the air. Toulalan did say, however, that players should always behave professionally, no matter what their differences. 'We can't all be the best friends in the world,' Toulalan said. 'But there's no way I'm going to go out on the pitch with the idea that I'm not going to pass to this player or that player.' Gourcuff said after the Mexico defeat that he was being made a scapegoat for the team's inability to score goals. 'It has been a collective failure over the two games. Football is hard when you can't play together,' Gourcuff said. 'Perhaps I have paid the price, I don't know. I've not had any explanations.' "

1,"BRUSSELS - The European Union Wednesday threatened a lawsuit against France over the expulsion of gypsies, saying French President Nicolas Sarkozy's government probably breached EU rules on the free movement of citizens. The European Commission started infringement proceedings over France's expulsion this year of more than 1,000 Roma, as gypsies from Eastern Europe are known, back to Romania and Bulgaria, both of which joined the EU in 2007. The French move included the dismantling of gypsy camps. 'We have opened a procedure of infraction against France,' Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding told French radio Wednesday. 'It's a question of if there has been discrimination.' The commission, the 27-nation EU's regulatory arm, decided to send the French government a letter of formal notice, the first step in a process that could lead to a complaint at the European court. France will conduct 'a detailed analysis of the commission's letter,' a spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry said by telephone. 'There have been a certain number of misunderstandings between France and the commission,' said the spokeswoman, who cannot be named according to ministry ground rules. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office 'won't publish any reaction,' spokesman Franck Louvrier said by telephone. Calls to the Justice and Immigration ministries weren't returned immediately. France's treatment of Roma, members of an ethnic minority who are EU citizens, rose to the top of the European political agenda in mid-September when Reding linked the policy to events during the Second World War and EU government heads debated the matter two days later at a Sept. 16 summit. The European Parliament, the Catholic Church and newspapers including Le Monde, the Financial Times and The New York Times have denounced France's policy. EU law prohibits governments from targeting ethnic minorities. European legislation does allow governments to expel citizens from other EU countries after three months for reasons of public order or should the people in question have insufficient economic resources or pose a burden to the domestic health- care system. ^-0-< With assistance from Gregory Viscusi and Helene Fouquet in Paris.

1,"Thirty-seven states will hold elections for governor in November, but none will have a more intriguing story line than California. Voters here will decide whether to make the youngest California governor of the 20th century the oldest ever elected in the state's history. Edmund G. 'Jerry' Brown Jr. is back _ or almost. He has not formally announced his candidacy for governor, but he is plotting the campaign from a warehouse office in downtown Oakland that is stocked with books, yellowed reports and decades-old documents outlining the problems of California from when he first was governor. 'I know how state government works, how it should work, and I think I can fix it,' Brown said in a recent interview. Brown is seeking a return to the governor's office at one of the most critical times in the modern history of California. The recession has battered the state's economy, forcing new taxes and painful spending cuts that have affected nearly every corner of the public sector. The political process appears broken, brought down by partisan polarization and by restrictions approved over the years through ballot initiatives that hamper lawmakers' efforts to forge consensus. Voters have lost confidence in both Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Democratic-controlled legislature. Whether Brown is the person to repair the damage will be the central question of his campaign. After four decades in government and politics, Brown said, he understands like few others 'the complexities and subtleties of how the state is wired together,' adding: 'I've spent the better part of my life in one form or another dealing with or thinking about issues of government.' To some people, that is Brown's problem. Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief executive who is seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination, said a Brown- Whitman campaign would offer voters a clear choice. 'I think Jerry is a very formidable competitor,' she said in an interview. 'He is very well known in the state, and this is a Democratic state. That said, I think the contrast between Jerry and me will be in stark relief: a career politician vs. a career businessperson who has created jobs, who has managed a business. It will be outsider vs. insider.' Brown disagrees. Although he has served two terms as governor, currently serves as attorney general, was mayor of Oakland, and was California secretary of state and chairman of the state Democratic Party, he refuses to be cast as the insider. 'I'm an outsider by my own sense of things,' he said. Challenged, he responded, 'I have an outsider's mind with an insider's perspective.' Brown would have no primary opponent. Whitman has to get through a primary against state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, who was successful in the technology business before turning to politics. Last week, Mike Murphy, one of Whitman's advisers, made a ham-handed attempt to push Poizner out of the race. He warned that Poizner would be put through the 'wood chipper' if he stayed in but could become the consensus choice to run for Senate in 2012 if he got out. Instead, Poizner called for an investigation by the FBI and the attorney general's office into Murphy's actions. From political theater, the episode quickly turned to farce. Murphy questioned Poizner's mental condition, and Poizner ended up coming under sharp criticism in California newspapers. Poizner, in an interview, defended himself, saying the Whitman campaign's actions crossed 'a very important bright line between hardball politics and threats and intimidation.' Whitman defended Murphy's attempts to force Poizner out. 'It was the normal course of business,' she said. Brown will turn 72 this spring. If elected in November, he would be twice the age he was when he first won the governorship, in 1974. He shrugged off the issue of age: 'If you're the person who knows the job intimately, you can't be the ingenue.' But an inexperienced opponent will carry baggage, as well, he added. 'If you have a person who says: `I've never done it before; why don't you try me? I've got fresh ideas' _ okay, that's the strength. The flip side is, you don't know what the heck you're doing.' Personally, he said, he has learned from his earlier experiences. His 1980 presidential campaign, he said, was probably a mistake. 'I was a young guy, but I was in kind of a hurry,' he said, leaving the impression that he was 'not doing my work' in California. He had his head turned as a young governor by the attention paid to him by East Coast columnists and others. 'There's an excitement and a superficiality that I think time changes _ for me anyway,' he said. 'I can see the work of the governor as more grounded in patient listening.' Brown said that, if elected, the biggest challenge will be resolving the state's budget gap, and he promised to engage the legislature 'in a way they've never been engaged to date and by communicating to the people ... what's possible and what isn't. Hard-headed realism is what's needed. There's a lot of smoke and mirrors going on here.' Some Democrats in the state worry that Brown is moving too slowly to ramp up his campaign or that he is ill-prepared for the intensity of a race fought in the age of 24-7 communications. Brown said he will resist becoming a consultant-driven candidate or loading up his payroll with expensive strategists, as Whitman has done. But he recognized the kind of campaign he's likely to face. 'I haven't had millions of dollars attacking my character and reputation. That's true,' he said. If she wins the GOP nomination, Whitman will have a sizable financial advantage over Brown. She has already put $39 million of her money into the race and could spend $150 million or more by the election in November. Brown can't compete with that kind of money, but he said of Whitman, 'Her money is not kryptonite.' Asked how he will prepare for that, he offered a lesson from St. Ignatius. He would summon all the 'Ignatian indifference' that he could. That is, he added, the idea of eschewing attachments to wealth or glory and preparing 'to do the will of God, however it manifests.' 'Here we have the will of the people,' Brown said, 'and how it turns out will be fine for me.' "
1,"The original Tea Party may have been in Boston, but some modern-day 'tea party' activists are finding a powerful narrative this summer at a different historic landmark: Colonial Williamsburg. Amid the history buffs and parents with young children wandering along the crushed shell paths of Virginia's restored colonial city, some noticeably angrier and more politically minded tourists can often be found. They stand in the crowd listening closely as the costumed actors relive dramatic moments in the founding of our country. They clap loudly when an actor portraying Patrick Henry delivers his 'Give me liberty or give me death' speech. They cheer and hoot when Gen. George Washington surveys the troops behind the original 18th-century courthouse. And they shout out about the tyranny of our current government during scenes depicting the nation's struggle for freedom from Britain. 'General, when is it appropriate to resort to arms to fight for our liberty?' asked a tourist on a recent weekday during 'A Conversation with George Washington,' a hugely popular dialogue between actor and audience in the shaded backyard of Charlton's Coffeehouse. Standing on a simple wooden stage before a crowd of about 100, the man portraying Washington replied: 'Only when all peaceful remedies have been exhausted. Or if we are forced to do so in our own self-defense.' The tourist, a self-described conservative activist named Ismael Nieves from Elmer, N.J., nodded thoughtfully. Afterward, he said this was his fifth visit to Colonial Williamsburg. 'We live in a very dangerous time,' Nieves said. 'People are looking for leadership, looking for what to do. They're looking to Washington, Jefferson, Madison.' 'I want to get to know our Founding Fathers,' he added. 'I think we've forgotten them. It's like we've almost erased them from history.' It's a common point of view among tea party activists. They say their unhappiness with Washington reflects how far the federal government has strayed, through taxation and regulation, from the Founders' intentions. 'They all should come here and listen,' said Bob Rohrbacher, a retired plumber from Floral Park, N.Y., who opposes President Barack Obama and was inspired to visit Williamsburg while watching Glenn Beck on Fox News. 'They've forgotten about America.' Hundreds of visitors gather to listen to the 'Revolutionary City' re-enactments that take place throughout the day along the historic area's Duke of Gloucester Street. One day last week, Patrick Henry stood on the south side of the colonial Capitol building and announced that a congress of representatives from all the colonies would begin meeting annually to protect the 'united interests of America.' The cheers were so enthusiastic that the tourists themselves might have been mistaken for colonists, were it not for the fanny packs and trilling cell phones. One man, wearing a red, white and blue golf shirt emblazoned with the American flag and the text of the Declaration of Independence, joined the actors in exclaiming, 'Well said!' every time a character uttered something patriotic. The executives who oversee Williamsburg said they have noticed the influx of tea partiers, and have also noted a rise in the number of guests who ply the costumed actors for advice about how to rebel against 21st-century politicians. (The actors do their best to provide 18th-century answers.) 'If people ... can recognize that subjects such as war and taxation, religion and race, were really at the heart of the situation in the 18th century, and there is some connection between what was going on then and what's going on now, that's all to the good,' said Colin Campbell, president and chairman of Colonial Williamsburg. 'What happened in the 18th century here required engagement, and what's required to preserve democracy in the 21st century is engagement. That is really our message.' The foundation that runs the programs at Colonial Williamsburg is nonprofit and nonpartisan, so neither Campbell nor other employees would venture an opinion on the significance of the tea party. But they welcome the business. Like most museums and historical sites, Williamsburg suffered during the recession; even before that, attendance had been dropping for more than a decade. In the late 1990s, annual ticket sales topped 1 million. Last year, that number had dropped to 660,000. Campbell's hope is that such visitors come away having learned something about the nuance and messiness of history _ a theme that runs through all of Colonial Williamsburg's programming. Sometimes, the activists appear surprised when the Founding Fathers don't always provide the 'give 'em hell' response they seem to be looking for. When a tourist asked George Washington a question about what should be done to those colonists who remain loyal to the tyrannical British king, Washington interjected: 'I hope that we're all loyal, sir' _ a reminder that Washington, far from being an early agitator against the throne, was among those who sought to avoid revolution until the very end. When another audience member asked the general to reflect on the role of prayer and religion in politics, he said: 'Prayers, sir, are a man's private concern. They are not a matter of public interest. And nor should they be. There is nothing so personal as a man's relationship with his creator.' And when another asked whether the Boston Tea Party had helped rally the patriots, Washington disagreed with force: The tea party 'should never have occurred,' he said. 'It's hurt our cause, sir.' That may not have been the answer the man expected from the father of our country. But even in that spirited crowd, no one was going to tell George Washington he was wrong. "
1,"The Palestinians are pressing for adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution that urges Israel and the Palestinians to carry out independent investigations of alleged war crimes during their conflict in Gaza last winter. The proposed General Assembly resolution also calls for possible Security Council action if both sides don't take credible steps in three months. The 192-nation world body has scheduled a meeting Wednesday to consider a resolution adopted by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on Oct. 16 that endorsed a report on the Gaza war by an expert panel chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. observer, said Tuesday the draft resolution is 'balanced and very responsible' and is supported by many countries, though several European nations indicated they are still seeking changes. 'We're listening to all comments, but the draft resolution as it stands, the thrust of it, is asking for investigation, and there is unanimity on that call,' he said. 'We'll take it from there.' Mansour said the resolution will definitely be approved, but he told AP, 'I don't think it will be put to a vote before Thursday.' The Palestinians and their supporters chose to go to the General Assembly because they face an uphill struggle in getting approval for a Gaza resolution in the Security Council. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding -- unlike Security Council resolutions -- but they reflect the views of the broader U.N. membership. The United States has repeatedly said the Goldstone report belongs in the Human Rights Council, and diplomats said Russia and China also don't want the Security Council dealing with human rights issues, which could bring a host of unwanted domestic issues before the U.N.'s most powerful body. All three countries have veto power in the Security Council. The draft General Assembly resolution would endorse the Human Rights Council resolution -- a point of contention for a number of European countries because the Palestinians and their supporters refused to negotiate on the text, which targeted only Israel and included references to Jerusalem and the Mideast peace process. The resolution was approved by a low vote of 25-6, with the United States and five European countries opposing it and 11 mostly European and African countries declining to vote, including Britain and France. The Goldstone report concluded that Israel used disproportionate force, deliberately targeting civilians, using Palestinians as human shields, and destroying civilian infrastructure during its incursion into Gaza to root out Palestinian rocket squads. It accused Palestinian armed groups of deliberately targeting civilians and trying to spread terror through its rocket attacks on southern Israel. Hamas, the Palestinian Authority's main rival, controls Gaza and most armed groups in the territory. The Goldstone panel accused both Israeli forces and Palestinian militants of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. It recommended that the Security Council require both sides to carry out credible investigations within three months into alleged abuses during the conflict -- in which 13 Israelis and almost 1,400 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, were killed -- and to follow that up with action in their courts. If either side refuses, the investigators recommended that the Security Council refer the evidence for prosecution by the International Criminal Court, the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal, within six months. The current version of the draft resolution to be considered by the General Assembly calls for Israel and 'the Palestinian side' to undertake 'independent, credible' investigations into the alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law raised in the Goldstone report within three months. The draft also asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to report to the General Assembly, within three months, on implementation of the resolution 'with a view to considering further action, if necessary, by the relevant United Nations organs and bodies, including by the Security Council.' The reference to possible council action is unacceptable to some European countries, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations are still under way. "
1,"Problem: Organizing kids' papers actually has two parts. First, parents must create order for dealing with permission slips and information a child brings home for them to read and sign. A parent should also set up a system for preserving report cards, artwork, school pictures and other paper that filters through children's lives, and maintain a family calendar. Second, parents must teach children how to maintain order for themselves. They need to learn how to have a place for everything in their bedroom, desk and backpack. Household routines keep a family running smoothly. Expert: Sandra Forbes, a professional organizer and mother of seven in suburban Washington. Her firm, Forbes Organizing, advises working moms and develops home management techniques. The fix: Forbes said kids need different guidance during three stages of their education. In elementary school, the challenge for children is bringing paper home and bringing paper back to school. In middle school, organizing all the supplies and books they need for every class becomes vital. In high school, the issue is time management. At each stage, a parent needs to work with their child in developing systems that help everyone get out the door on time in the morning and into bed at a decent hour. Some kids need a checklist on the front door of what they need to bring to school every day, from lunch money to band instruments. Some families load backpacks at night and set them by the door or other 'launch pad' before bedtime. Creating a designated home study area is essential. 'They should have all the supplies they need to do their work,' she says. 'Then they don't get up to get something and get distracted.' Keeping a family binder in your kitchen or on your desk gives a home to all the essential paper that's constantly arriving from teachers, band leaders and coaches. Forbes uses a three-ring binder with tabs for each child. Using clear sleeves, Forbes organized schedules, phone lists and academic and sports calendars. You can use a similar binder for report cards and awards. She purges unneeded papers at the end of the school year and starts over. 'Piled-up paper is a lack of making decisions,' she said. 'You want to avoid that.' Tips 1. Keep a bright-colored file labeled 'pending' for permission slips and any other paperwork that is due sometime in the future. It prevents last-minute panic. 2. Forbes uses the Microsoft Outlook calendar as a master clearinghouse for family dates. She clicks and drags e-mails into her calendar so all the information she needs on an activity is in the same place. 3. A weekly cleaning by each child of his own bedroom floor can turn up missing items and keep the room orderly so kids can focus on studying. Clean out backpacks, where children tend to stuff old papers and food wrappers in there. This weekly ritual often turns up missing library books, too, she said. "

1,"WASHINGTON - Candidates, parties and outside groups have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political advertisements aimed at swaying the Nov. 2 congressional elections, a study found. Ad spending on House and Senate races climbed to $220 million through Sept. 15, from $135 million at the same point in 2008, according to data analyzed by the Wesleyan Media Project. The increase mainly comes from Senate races, with Florida, Pennsylvania and Nevada topping the list, the study found. 'Both Republicans and Democrats have a legitimate shot of having majorities in Congress,' spurring spending, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the project, in a statement Monday. Americans' dissatisfaction with the economy and the direction of the country is jeopardizing Democratic control of the House and Senate. Opposition to President Barack Obama has also fueled an increase in spending by Republican-leaning outside groups. Outside groups such as Crossroads GPS, advised by Republican strategist Karl Rove, have spent more than $31 million on ads for this year's Senate races, up from $16 million in 2008, the Wesleyan Media Project found. Candidates in those races have more than doubled their spending to $121 million. Some of the increase in non-candidate spending can be traced to the Supreme Court's January decision that freed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts from their treasuries, said Ridout, a political science professor at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. That decision, known as Citizens United, isn't causing many corporations to do direct advertising, said Erika Franklin Fowler, another co-director of the project. Instead, more money is flowing into issue advocacy groups that don't have to report contributors to the Federal Election Commission, she said. 'We are seeing evidence of changing tactics as groups seek shelter in the rules for nonprofits that allow such organizations to withhold their donor names,' said Fowler, a government professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. The advertising project, which used data from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, found that almost $350 million has been spent on advertising for gubernatorial races this cycle. About one quarter, or $89 million, came from California Republican candidate Meg Whitman, the former chief executive officer of EBay Inc. The Republican Governors Association has spent more than $12 million on ads, and Republican interest groups have outspent Democratic counterparts by a margin of 2-1 overall, the study found. Two Republican-leaning groups, Let's Get to Work and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have each spent close to $7 million. The top two outside groups for Democrats are California Working Families for Jerry Brown for Governor, which has spent $6.6 million, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which has spent just over $6 million, barely topping Crossroads GPS. Republicans are depending on outside groups to help them overcome a deficit in official party fundraising.

1,"Europe had its first year without executions in 2009, human rights group Amnesty International said Tuesday. But the London-based organization said the spell was recently broken by the execution of two men in Belarus -- an indication of the challenges the group faces as it fights to abolish capital punishment. Amnesty International has been tracking executions internationally since 1980, although their figures don't include extra-judicial killings or the casualties of war. Western European countries such as France, Britain and Germany abolished the death penalties in the years following World War II, and abolition spread rapidly through Eastern Europe with the collapse of Iron Curtain. Many former Soviet satellites banned capital punishment in the 1980s and '90s. Russia and Ukraine have not executed anyone more than a decade. Amnesty said that Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan have executed about 130 people between them over the past 10 years, but since 2006 Belarus has been the only European state to carry out death sentences. The death penalty is 'on its way out,' according to Amnesty's interim Secretary General Claudio Cordone, before acknowledging that countries such as Belarus were a 'hard core' where the practice would likely linger for some time. Amnesty said Belarus executed two convicts just under two weeks ago. Death row prisoners in the authoritarian country are only given a few moments' notice before they're killed. They're then shot in the back of the head and their bodies are buried secretly, the group said. Worldwide, the total number of officially state-sanctioned executions is as uncertain as ever -- in large part because China, the world's largest executioner, refuses to say how many prisoners it puts to death. Unusually, Amnesty said it would refuse to put a figure to the scale of Chinese executions, saying that previous estimates -- based on publicly available data -- have been far too low. In 2008, Amnesty put the minimum figure of people put to death at 1,718. The group said the true number is somewhere in the thousands, and has publicly challenged the Chinese government to publish the full number of people killed by the state -- a move Amnesty's secretary general said was made after the rights group failed to persuade the government to release the figures. 'We want the Chinese government to lift the veil of secrecy,' Cordone said. 'The Chinese authorities claim that fewer executions are taking place. If this is true, why won't they tell the world how many people the state put to death?' A Chinese Foreign Ministry duty officer reached after hours in Beijing had no immediate comment. While there's no indication that China plans to make its execution figures public, the country's highest court issued new guidelines last month said the death penalty should be limited to a small number of 'extremely serious' cases. Amnesty has also tracked a spike in executions in Iraq. The group put the number of Iraqi executions in 2006 at 65. Minimum figures for 2007 and 2008 were 33 and 34 respectively. In 2009, the figure jumped to 120. Cordone said the pace of executions had picked up as the government took efforts to crack down on terrorism, something he said was 'absurd' given that many Iraqi terrorist seemed happy to die for their cause. 'It's not an answer to suicide bombing,' he said. 'As a deterrent it's not going to work.' Iraq's neighbor, Iran, continues to be the Middle East's biggest executioner, according to Amnesty, which said that the Islamic Republic put 388 people to death in 2009 -- including at least 112 people killed in the two months following the country's disputed elections. The group also noted that the United States remains -- as it has for years -- the only state in the Americas to consistently carry out executions. Fifty-two people were put to death in the United States in 2009, Amnesty said. It said more than 100 people were sentenced to death over the same period. ------ Associated Press Writer Anita Chang in Beijing contributed to this report. ------ On the Net: "
1,"Japan Airlines, wooed for months by Delta Air Lines with promises of cash and a broad global network, spurned the world's biggest carrier and opted to keep its alliance with American Airlines. The Japanese carrier said in a statement Tuesday it will strengthen its partnership with American and the two airlines will jointly ask the U.S. and Japanese governments for antitrust immunity on trans-Pacific routes. The decision brings to an end a fierce tug-of-war over Japan's ailing flagship carrier, which is restructuring under bankruptcy but offers the U.S. airlines access to lucrative Asian routes. In an aggressive courtship, Delta and its partners offered JAL $1 billion to leave oneworld. American and its partners said they would give JAL as much as $1.4 billion to stay. There was no mention in JAL's statement Tuesday of money being part of the deal. Delta in a statement didn't directly address JAL's choice of American, instead asserting it remains a big player in Asia. 'With recently announced plans to invest $1 billion in our product, Delta remains committed to providing a leading option for travel across the Pacific,' the airline said. American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said in a statement it believes JAL made the right choice. It reiterated that American and its oneworld partners plan to deliver to JAL roughly $2 billion in ongoing and incremental revenue over three years. 'American and JAL will now focus on building a joint venture that can offer JAL significant revenue growth beyond the stability that oneworld offers today,' American said. Its victory seemed improbable just a few weeks ago when Japanese officials, convinced of the long-term revenue benefits, were pushing JAL toward Delta and its SkyTeam partners. But after taking over last month, new JAL chairman Kazuo Inamori insisted that management would re-evaluate both proposals from scratch. JAL's loyalties swung back to American in the end as executives decided an alliance switch would do more harm than good during a restructuring that is expected to take three years. 'The biggest reason for our decision to strengthen our alliance with American is to avoid inconvenience to our customers as much as we can,' Daiji Nagai, senior vice president of corporate planning, told reporters. Also, antitrust immunity -- the key to a closer revenue-sharing relationship between U.S. and Asian carriers -- would likely have been difficult for JAL to achieve with Delta because of competition concerns. American and Delta were vying to keep pace with the Star alliance, which includes United Airlines, Continental Airlines and JAL rival All Nippon Airways. Star alliance has 31 percent of U.S.-Japan market share. United, Continental and All Nippon Airways have applied for antitrust immunity so they can form a joint venture and work together more closely on flights across the Pacific. Delta would have submitted its own application if it landed Japan Airlines. But it will be American, part of the oneworld alliance, taking on that task now. A joint venture allows airlines to share costs and revenue on certain flights regardless of which airline owns or flies the aircraft. It differs from a codesharing agreement where one airline bears all the cost but another airline might get a share of the revenue for booking a customer on a flight. JAL President Masaru Onishi said the Tokyo-based company analyzed the issue 'in great detail.' He said management 'firmly believe that the advantages of this development with American Airlines can strongly support JAL at a time when we are striving toward the revival of our business, which we are determined to achieve.' There is no guarantee American and Japan Airlines will be able to get antitrust immunity, either. But JAL in the end wasn't willing to take the risk of moving to Delta. -------- Harry R.

1,"Two suicide bombers attacked a British private security firm in a central neighborhood here Tuesday afternoon, engaging in a running shootout with guards before blowing themselves up and killing two of the company's Afghan drivers. The attack on Hart Security's Afghan headquarters pierced the usual bustle of the mostly residential Taimany neighborhood and served as another reminder that the capital is not immune from the insurgent violence plaguing much of the rest of the country. Afghan police officials confirmed the four deaths and said a security guard for the firm was taken to the hospital after being wounded in the attack. Witnesses and a shopkeeper next door to the firm described seeing two young men, perhaps teenagers, running through the streets with their faces hidden, shooting at the building and guards out front. The building was pockmarked with bullets, glass was shattered on upper levels above a security wall and a car near the building was singed. A bloody leg lay on one side of the street. Officials lifted the torso and legs of a second dead body and wrapped them in a plastic sheet. The attack came as the United Nations released data showing that civilian casualties in Afghanistan have risen 31 percent this year compared with last year. The report showed that the spike has been caused largely by increased killings by the Taliban and other insurgent groups, who have taken more violent actions, such as using car bombs and suicide bombers. U.N. staff recorded 1,271 civilian deaths and 1,997 injuries. Of those, insurgent forces were responsible for 2,477 casualties, while NATO and Afghan government forces accounted for 386. 'The job of the government is to fight with the terrorists in Afghanistan, but if our actions cause the casualties of civilians, it is not justifiable in any way,' Waheed Omer, spokesman for President Hamid Karzai, said at a news conference Tuesday. 'And we also want from the opposition group to stop the killing of civilians in Afghanistan.' Omer also reiterated Karzai's pronouncement last week that government will seek the disbanding of all private security firms in the country, which Omer said employed more than 30,000 well-armed, well-trained security officials. He called them 'thieves by day, terrorists by night' because they abuse their power and weaponry. A call placed to the Hart office was not answered. The company's Web site said it was founded in 1999 by Lord Richard Westbury. 'Hart's management team combines extensive experience in conventional and special forces military service and maritime expertise,' according to the site. The firm has offices in more than a dozen countries, but the address of the Afghanistan office was withheld from the site for security reasons.

1,"The dollar edged up Thursday, breaking a decline that's caused developing countries to worry that the sinking U.S. currency is making their exports expensive and threatening their fledgling economic recoveries. A lower dollar -- and China's yuan, which is effectively pegged to the dollar -- makes other countries' goods relatively more expensive. China has recently signaled that it might be ready to let its currency rise. American manufacturers contend that China's yuan is undervalued by 20 to 40 percent against the dollar, giving the country a huge trade advantage. On the other hand, the yuan's low value allows U.S. consumers and major retailers, such as Wal-Mart, to buy Chinese imports cheaply. Finance ministers from 21 Asia-Pacific countries agreed Thursday to embrace more flexible exchange rates. Their official statements downplayed China's refusal to let the yuan appreciate over the past year and a half. But their commentary signaled the distress countries are feeling as their currencies rise against the yuan and the dollar. 'The weaker yuan is hurting and slowing the recovery' as other countries' exports face tough competition from cheaper Chinese goods, said Forex.com chief currency analyst Brian Dolan. In the past two months, Brazil, Taiwan and some countries have taken steps to try to contain the rise in their currencies. Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has warned about the dangers of exchange-rate volatility. He said he supports the Obama administration's strong-dollar stance. In morning trading Thursday, the 16-nation euro dipped to $1.4912 from $1.4976 late Wednesday and the dollar rose to 90.33 Japanese yen from 89.84 yen. The British pound slipped to $1.6537 from $1.6554. In a joint statement, officials at the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Singapore, including the U.S. and China, agreed to pursue flexible exchange rates. Their statement reflected concerns over China's linking of the yuan to the falling dollar despite its pledges to move toward market-based exchange rates. Seeking to bolster the dollar, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in Singapore that 'it is very important for the U.S. that we have a strong dollar, that we sustain confidence in our financial system.' The APEC finance ministers pledged to maintain government stimulus measures as long as the private sector remains weak. That's going to hurt the dollar's value, Brown Brothers Harriman analysts said. The dollar tends to lose value as a result of better-than-expected economic reports or government stimulus measures as investors pursue riskier, high-yielding assets in other countries. That's prompting a flood of money into developing countries. Many of these countries offer higher interest rates on their securities than the major economies do. But the resulting rise in the value of their currencies makes their exports more expensive. The Treasury is aware about the 'angst' of other countries over dollar weakness, Dolan said. But there's nothing that's going to help the dollar rise in the current environment unless the Federal Reserve signals it will boost interest rates. Thursday's small gain is 'nothing more than a blip on the screen,' he said. China has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy and curtailed the rise in its currency to make its exports more competitive. Beijing is now signaling that it could refine the yuan's exchange rate by taking account of changes in major currencies other than the dollar. By omitting its often-used language of keeping the yuan 'basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level,' China's central bank is suggesting a policy shift on yuan's exchange rate, analysts said. But Beijing isn't likely to allow an 'aggressive' appreciation in the yuan, said Credit Suisse analysts. The central bank doesn't think the export recovery has been strong enough to allow such a rise, they said in a research note Thursday. On Monday, World Bank chief economist Justin Yifu Lin, the first Chinese national to serve in that job, said China should not be forced to let the yuan rise. The Obama administration has chosen not to cite China as a currency manipulator. But it has stressed the importance of 'rebalancing' global trade flows. President Barack Obama is expected to address foreign-exchange volatility when he arrives at the APEC summit in Singapore later this week, Dolan said. While China let the yuan, officially known as the renminbi, appreciate starting in mid-2005, it curtailed that rise starting last summer as it bought up huge amounts of U.S. Treasurys while the global recession wracked trade. China is now the largest holder of U.S. securities. ------ AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger in Washington contributed to this report. "
1,"Brian Roberts hit a grand slam in a six-run second inning and tied a franchise record with his 51st double as the Baltimore Orioles beat up A.J. Burnett and the New York Yankees 7-3 in the American League on Saturday. Brian Matusz (5-2) won his third straight start, and the Yankees lost consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 16-17 at Seattle and Oakland. Burnett (11-9) was hit hard for the third time in five starts and appeared far from ready to start Game 2 or 3 of the postseason next month. He allowed six runs and seven hits in seven innings, is 1-5 in his last nine starts, and has a 7.67 ERA in his last five outings while giving up eight homers. A day after surpassing Lou Gehrig for the Yankees career hits lead, Derek Jeter was 1 for 5 to leave his total at 2,724. Athletics 4, Twins 2 At Minneapolis, Brett Anderson threw seven sharp innings, and Cliff Pennington had three hits with an RBI as Oakland beat Minnesota for its fifth win in six games. Anderson (9-10) retired 18 of 24 batters, including the final eight he faced, and didn't allow a walk for the fourth time this season to win his second-consecutive start. A day after hitting a season-high five homers and 10 extra-base hits in their 12-5 rout of the Twins, the A's scored three of their four runs on sacrifice flies. White Sox 4, Angels 3, 10 innings At Anaheim, California, Scott Podsednik hit an inside-the-park homer and scored the go-ahead run in the 10th inning on a wild pitch to lead Chicago over Los Angeles. Podsednik hit the White Sox's first inside-the-park homer since 2002 in the third. He doubled leading off the 10th against Angels closer Brian Fuentes (1-4). Gordon Beckham singled to advance Podsednik to third. A.J. Pierzynski then hit a flyball to center that was too shallow for Podsednik to score. Rookie Kevin Jepsen relieved and threw a wild pitch to the backstop on a 1-2 count and Podsednik raced home for the lead. John Danks scattered six hits over six scoreless innings and left with a 3-0 lead, but the White Sox bullpen couldn't protect it. Red Sox 9, Rays 1, 5 innings At Boston, Josh Beckett won his first game in a month and Alex Gonzalez led an eight-run third inning as Boston beat Tampa Bay in a game called by rain in the top of the sixth. It was another encouraging sign for Beckett after a four-game stretch in which he allowed 24 earned runs and 12 homers in 24 1-3 innings. On Saturday, Beckett (15-6) allowed four hits with four strikeouts and a walk in five innings. The last hit was a double by Evan Longoria leading off the sixth, the final batter before the field was covered in a pouring rain. After a 55-minute delay, the game was called at 11:54 p.m. The start of the game had been delayed for 2 hours, 5 minutes in which there was no rain most of the time. Blue Jays 8, Tigers 6 At Detroit, Aaron Hill hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the ninth inning to cap Toronto's come-from-behind victory over slumping Detroit. Rod Barajas, Vernon Wells and Marco Scutaro also homered for Toronto, which handed the AL Central-leading Tigers their fifth straight loss. Miguel Cabrera, Curtis Granderson and Alex Avila homered for Detroit. The Blue Jays tied it at 6 in the eighth on Brandon Lyon's wild pitch that allowed Wells to score from third. Scutaro singled with two out in the ninth. He then stole second before Hill drilled Fernando Rodney's pitch for his 32nd homer. Indians 13, Royals 6 At Cleveland, Jhonny Peralta drove in four runs to help David Huff become Cleveland's first 10-game winner as the Indians snapped Kansas City's five-game winning streak. Peralta had a two-run double in the fourth inning off Luke Hochevar (6-10) and his two-run single capped a five-run sixth that put Cleveland ahead 11-3. Huff (10-9) won his third straight start, improving to 5-1 in six outings since Aug. 9. The left-hander allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings, striking out a career-high six. He is the first Cleveland rookie to win 10 games since Ryan Drese went 10-9 in 2002. Mariners 8, Rangers 3, 8 1/2 innings At Arlington, Texas, Ichiro Suzuki had two hits to move within two of a record ninth-straight 200-hit season as Seattle beat Texas in a game called off by rain with three outs remaining. Suzuki doubled in the first and homered in the third before going hitless in his last three at-bats. He shares the mark with Willie Keeler, who had eight consecutive 200-hit seasons from 1984-1901. The Rangers had two men on in the bottom of the ninth when umpires stopped play because the weather was too much to overcome. Ken Griffey Jr., Franklin Gutierrez and Jack Hannahan each had two RBIs, and Brandon Morrow (1-4) pitched five innings to win for the first time since Sept. 26, 2008. "
1,"Ace drag flicker Sohail Abbas and veteran Rehan Butt helped Pakistan regain Asian Games field hockey gold after 20 years with a 2-0 victory over Malaysia in the final on Thursday. Abbas netted a powerful push off 26th-minute short corner while Butt was brilliantly set up by Shafqat Rasool from the right side to place the ball off the second attempt in the 38th. 'With so many bad things happening in Pakistan, like terrorism and floods I think today we have given our countrymen something to smile,' Abbas, 35, said. Malaysian players had shaved their heads to ward off evil spirits in their first Asian Games final. But their penalty corner specialist Amin Rahim could not find the target off the three short corners. Pakistan's last Asian Games gold came in 1990 at Beijing, and the win here was Pakistan's first major title since winning the World Cup in 1994. 'It's simply out of this world for me and I have no words to describe how much happy all of us are,' said jubilant Pakistan captain Zeeshan Ashraf, 33, who stood firm in the defense. The victory also secured Pakistan a spot at the 2012 London Olympics and Ashraf said that was the other target which was achieved by senior players. 'I think it's now the right time that more juniors should come into the team,' he said. 'Twenty years is a long gap and it would be jubilation everywhere in Pakistan.' Abbas said he had no intentions to quit and if he stayed fit he would be in London in two years. 'Age is no barrier for a hockey player, fitness is what that counts and who knows if I stay fit I will be there,' he said. Pakistan goalkeeper Salman Akbar threw his helmet and hockey stick in the air soon after the final hooter was blown as Pakistan players rushed and hugged each other. They even raised their coach Michel van den Heuvel and manager former Olympian Khawaja Junaid on their shoulders and chanted slogans 'Pakistan Zindabad (long live)' in unison. They carried national flags in their hands and also approached a handful of fans at the Aoti Hockey Stadium stand to thank them for their support. Malaysia's striker Faizal Saari was disappointed with his team's loss, but said it was good to have its first silver in 12 Asian Games after winning six bronze medals. 'We played disappointing game today and of course expectations were high back home after we defeated India in the semifinal,' he said. Earlier, India clinched the bronze, defeating South Korea 1-0 on Tushar Khandker's field goal in the 39th minute. "
1,"Dead ahead through the helicopter windshield, it appears like a mirage at the hazy horizon: A city in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. A city on fire. Just a few months ago the site of the disaster, 42 miles from the last marsh grass at the very tip of the Mississippi River delta, boasted a solitary drilling rig called Deepwater Horizon. Now that rig rests upside-down in the mud at the bottom of the gulf, and in its place is a roaring industrial complex, an emergency operation unlike anything in the history of the petroleum industry. More than 60 vessels are trying to capture the oil, burn it, disperse it, whatever it takes, while two giant rigs are drilling relief wells and officials keep their eyes on the weather reports, racing to kill the leaking well before a hurricane forces everyone to scatter to calmer waters. This waterworld is hot, noisy and dangerous. Two flares create hypnotic focal points for the flotilla. The drillship Discoverer Enterprise, parked directly on top of the well that exploded on April 20, is capturing oil from the well and burning gas separately. The other flare, larger, brighter, looking like an umbrella of fire turned on its side, shoots from a pipe on the well-servicing rig Q4000, which is burning both oil and gas. If the weather turns violent, all this will have to be hastily disassembled. Right now there's a storm in the southern gulf, named Alex, the first named Atlantic tropical storm of the season, but it is moving west and appears to be on a path to spare the Deepwater Horizon site. Officials remain anxious. Forecasters say it will be a busy storm season. This makeshift city can't ride out a major storm. The Enterprise will need up to five days of warning before gale-force winds arrive to decouple from the well that BP named Macondo, after the fictional city in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude.' Ships and rigs will sail toward calmer waters, leaving the well to gush freely until they return. Among the vessels that would have to leave are the two enormous rigs that are drilling relief wells, which are critical to killing the Macondo well. Development Driller III was the first to begin operations, and it has burrowed more than 11,000 feet below the sea floor, homing in on the blown-out well. It can already pick up magnetic signals from Macondo's steel casing. The second, Transocean's Development Driller II, started later and isn't as deep yet. It is 324 feet by 258 feet, dominated by a 228-foot derrick. It is here that a handful of journalists dropped in this weekend for a tour of disaster- response life. 'We want to get this thing done so bad _ it hurts. But you can only do it at a certain pace,' said Mitchell Bullock, 61, the BP well-site leader, a job that more traditionally is known as 'the company man.' As with the Deepwater Horizon, this rig is leased by BP, but is largely staffed by Transocean employees. Even though this is an emergency operation, performed under the heat lamp of global media attention, it is also business as usual. There is no sense of crisis. The people on the rig are doing what they do best: drilling a well. They're making a hole in the bottom of the sea. Jeremy Marts, 31, is a driller, operating out of the auxiliary drill shack. It's air-conditioned, with a glass top, protected by steel grating, that offers a view of 149 sections of drillpipe racked to the rafters, each pipe 122 feet long, at 34 pounds per foot: heavy-duty stuff that's ready to be linked together for the miles-long drilling operation. 'It's just a process that takes time,' Marts said. 'It doesn't happen overnight. We're out here, drilling a well. That's our focus. I wake up in the morning, my focus is to keep all these guys safe for the 12 hours I'm working.' Twelve hours on, twelve hours off _ that's the schedule. There's foosball in the rec room. There's a Wii. There's TV and Internet. Two workout rooms, one for cardio, one with weights. Steak nights are Saturday and Tuesday; Friday is seafood and Sunday is fried chicken. This is an entirely planned environment. No drinking, no drugs, smoking only in designated areas. Clothes must be clean in the accommodations areas. No oily coveralls in the mess hall. No loud noises near the sleeping compartments. A training video declares that 'horseplay' is absolutely prohibited. 'You spend half your life out here. Your co-workers become like family,' said Tommy Lenoir, 46, a BP health and safety representative on the rig. Matt Michalski, the rig's master, is 32 and has the easygoing nature of a surfer dude. No accident, that: When he choppers back to terra firma, he beelines for the New Orleans airport and, after changing planes in Houston, is in San Diego and then is riding the Pacific waves _ all in the same day. What do fellow surfers think of what he's doing? 'Some people are curious,' he said. 'Some people have different opinions about offshore drilling than I.' The relief wells are all-important for ending the gushing-geyser phase of the crisis. The idea is to send mud, then cement, to the root of the well, clogging the hole at the base before the rising hydrocarbons gain momentum. At the well's bottom, the oil and gas are moving like a train easing out of the station; by the time they reach the lower pressures at the top of the well, they're barreling along the tracks at top speed. The endgame is tricky. No one knows the condition of the wellbore deep below the gulf. It's conceivable that the bottom of the well has eroded around the steel casing, said Charles West, a geophysicist who has consulted for the petroleum industry and worked on relief wells. If that's the situation, he said, drilling into the casing would be 'like trying chase a strand of spaghetti around with a spoon.' That would force the drillers to back up and aim a bit higher on the well. Finding the target is critical. The drill bit can't turn on a dime; if it misses, it will have to be backed up for another approach. 'They got to get it right,' said Chris Wokowsky, 49, the Offshore Installation Manager and Transocean's top guy on the rig. He looks relaxed, confident. This is a steady operation, literally so: You can't even tell, moment to moment, that the rig is floating. Peer over a handrail and you can see, below the water, the white outline of giant pontoons that keep the rig afloat. Eight thrusters on the four corners continuously adjust to wind and wave to keep the rig positioned within a foot of where it is supposed to be. A digital display on the bridge shows the distances to all the other vessels. The Enterprise is 0.45 miles away; the Q4000 is 0.63 miles; the DD3 is 0.47 miles. There are 64 ships within five miles. Plus two robotic submarines nearly a mile below. Dean Miller is the submersible operator. 'We regularly see deep-sea rays, squid, octopus,' said Miller, 33 and British. At a reporter's request, he joysticks a sub to take a broad view of the blowout preventer on top of the well. It's a huge structure. Intact. The riser emerges from the top. This is what these things are supposed to look like. The tour over, the visitors return to the helipad. The chopper rises and makes a half-circle around the city on the water, the roar of the flares drowned out by the thumping of the rotors. The flight crosses the vast oil slick, which is capricious, sometimes forming vast swaths of silver-gray sheen, other times streaking the surface with red-orange tendrils. The oil is invisible from some angles; from others it goes on and on into the distance, no end in sight. "
1,"Tens of thousands of mourners filled the streets of central Warsaw with red votive candles Saturday night in a display of patriotism and grief hours after President Lech Kaczynski and senior Polish officials were killed when the presidential jet crashed in heavy fog in western Russia. The crash, which officials said killed all 97 people on board, cut a devastating swath through Poland's political and military elite. In addition to Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, the dead included the national bank's president, the deputy foreign minister, the head of the National Security Office, the deputy Parliament speaker as well as lawmakers and presidential aides. Among military personnel killed were the army chief of staff, the head of the air force and the navy chief commander. The tragedy generated what mourners in Warsaw described as a spontaneous outpouring of support, not necessarily for Kaczynski's nationalist politics or his party, but for the office of the presidency and for all those killed alongside him in the service of the nation. 'You can look around the street here, and half the people would not be voting for Kaczynski,' said Aleksander Zborowski, 36, an Arizona State University- educated engineer who was standing in front of the presidential palace along with thousands of other mourners. 'But they are here because he was our president. It is patriotism.' Prime Minister Donald Tusk called the crash 'the most tragic event of the country's postwar history,' and his government called on Poles to observe two minutes of silence. Under Poland's constitution, Tusk exercises primary control over the government, based on his party's majority in Parliament. The president, although the titular armed forces commander, plays a largely ceremonial role. Also listed among the dead were some revered figures in the Polish struggle to break free of communism: Anna Walentynowicz, 80, the diminutive crane operator whose firing in August 1980 from the Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk helped spark the creation of Solidarity, the political movement that nine years later helped topple the communist government; and the last Polish president in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, 90, who stepped down when Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, became the first post-communist president of Poland. 'This is a great tragedy, a great shock to us all,' Walesa said. The crash occurred Saturday morning near the city of Smolensk as the president's plane, a 26-year-old Russian-made Tupolev TU-154, was carrying the officials to a ceremony in Russia commemorating the Soviet massacre of Poland's officer corps in 1940 at the outset of World War II, one of the most traumatic events in 20th- century Polish history. The governor of the Smolensk region said the pilot decided to land despite advice from the control tower that he divert to another airport because of poor visibility. The three-engine aircraft clipped trees and broke apart about a mile short of the runway at a military airport, officials said. Television images showed small fires amid the fog and a broken tail fin with the red and white colors of the Polish flag. Kazcynski, who became president in 2005, was the identical twin brother of former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Together they had roiled domestic and international politics with their combative brand of Polish conservatism that was suspicious of both the Kremlin and the European Union bureaucracy in Brussels. Lech Kaczynski was facing re-election this fall but was trailing in opinion polls. 'In the face of this tragedy, we stand all united,' said Bronislaw Komorowski, speaker of the lower house of Parliament and now the acting president. 'There is no left or right, there are no differences, no divisions. We are all together with our message of compassion to the families of those who died nearby the Smolensk airport.' Komorowski declared a week of national mourning. President Barack Obama, who also telephoned Tusk, said in a statement, 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kaczynski family, the loved ones of those killed in this tragic plane crash, and the Polish nation.' Obama said the tragedy was 'devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the world' and described Kaczynski as 'a distinguished statesman who played a key role in the Solidarity movement and ... was widely admired in the United States as a leader dedicated to advancing freedom and human dignity.' The Polish delegation had been planning to mark the 70th anniversary of the summary execution of more than 20,000 Polish officers by the Soviet Union's secret police, the NKVD, in the forest of Katyn. The spring 1940 massacre followed the division of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union at the beginning of World War II. The killings, which were ordered by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, were coldly systematic: Each officer was shot in the back of the head, his hands tied behind his back. And by wiping out such a large part of the Polish officer corps, the Soviets created a leadership vacuum they were able to exploit when the Red Army drove the Nazis out of Poland. For decades, the Soviets attempted to cover up the crime, blaming it on the Nazis, and the authorities in Moscow did not accept responsibility until 1990, when Mikhail Gorbachev said the Soviet Union carried out the killings. The legacy of Katyn still festers in Russian-Polish relations, and some in Russia still dismiss the crime as an anti-Russia conspiracy whipped up by the Poles. 'This is unbelievable _ this tragic, cursed Katyn,' Kaczynski's predecessor, Aleksander Kwasniewski, said on Polish television. 'You get chills down your spine.' Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took charge of an investigation into the crash, flying to Smolensk, where he was scheduled to meet Tusk, who flew in from Warsaw. Both men had attended a ceremony this week marking the Katyn massacre, and Putin _ the first Russian leader to attend the commemoration _ said, 'We bow our heads to those who bravely met death here.' James Sherr, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a London- based think tank, stressed the need for transparency. 'The Russians will be under pressure to handle this in an extremely impressive way, and it is possible, if they can, that the relationship between the countries will benefit,' he said. 'But if the crash and emotions provoked by it lead to recriminations and defensiveness, then we will see something else.' A nationalist with an abiding suspicion of Russia, Kaczynski, 60, did not attend the joint ceremony Wednesday and instead was arriving for a largely Polish ceremony Saturday. Kazcynski had in the past infuriated Moscow with his embrace of Ukrainian and Georgian leaders hostile to Moscow and his support for the placement of a U.S. missile defense system on Polish soil. The deaths near Katyn of Kazcynski and a delegation sprinkled with people who had felt the heavy hand of the Soviets seems extraordinary and will certainly fuel conspiracy theories about the crash. But all early reports pointed to pilot error. Polish and Russian officials said the plane was serviced and refurbished at a Russian plant in December, but the Polish government's continued use of aging Russian jets has been the source of some controversy in the country. The government said it could not afford a new fleet of Western planes. Finn reported from Washington. Special correspondent Karla Adam in London contributed to this report. "
1,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said additional monetary stimulus may be warranted because inflation is too low and unemployment is too high. 'There would appear _ all else being equal _ to be a case for further action,' Bernanke said Friday in remarks to a Boston Fed conference. He said the central bank could expand asset purchases or change the language in its statement, while saying 'nonconventional policies have costs and limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether and how aggressively they should be used.' Bernanke's speech fueled speculation that the Fed will embark on a second round of monetary easing next month. By emphasizing the Fed's caution and inexperience with its unconventional tools, Bernanke is indicating a preference for taking a 'buy-as-you-go approach' with purchases of bonds, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. 'In light of the Fed's move into uncharted territory,' it 'wants to maintain maximum flexibility,' LaVorgna said in a note to clients. The Fed will probably announce another round of large-scale asset purchases in November. Such a program may include a monthly, quarterly or inter-meeting purchase target, he said. Bernanke didn't offer new details on how those strategies would be executed or signal the central bank will act at its Nov. 2-3 meeting. After lowering interest rates almost to zero and buying $1.7 trillion of securities, policy- makers are discussing expanding the Fed's balance sheet by purchasing Treasuries and strategies for raising inflation expectations, according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's Sept. 21 meeting. 'At current rates of inflation, the constraint imposed by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is too tight' and the 'risk of deflation is higher than desirable,' Bernanke said. 'High unemployment is currently forecast to persist for some time.' A smaller-than-forecast increase in the cost of living reported Friday by the Labor Department punctuated Bernanke's concern that inflation is too low. The consumer-price index rose 0.1 percent in September after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two months, figures from the Labor Department showed. Economists projected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Excluding volatile food and fuel costs, the rate was unchanged for a second month. Fed officials' long-term preferred range for the inflation rate is about 1.7 percent to 2 percent. 'The CPI number will only add to the expectation' that the Fed will take action, Gary Jenkins, head of fixed-income at Evolution Securities in London, said in an e-mail. Bernanke is 'saying, 'We are going to do it, but we don't quite know exactly how we are going to do it.'' Bernanke 'can't front-run a decision if it hasn't been made yet, and he's got a democratic committee, a committee that has a wide range of views,' Vincent Reinhart, former Fed monetary-affairs director, said on Bloomberg Television's 'In the Loop with Betty Liu.' Since the FOMC's last meeting in September, New York Fed President William Dudley, Boston's Eric Rosengren and Chicago's Charles Evans have indicated they favor further action. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher have suggested they oppose additional measures. The Kansas City Fed's Thomas Hoenig has voted against the FOMC's decisions for the past six meetings. 'Some of the specifics market participants want to hear haven't been decided on yet,' Reinhart said. Still, 'the decision to ease quantitatively is pretty much baked in the cake unless the data turned out to be extremely surprising between now' and the FOMC meeting. Fed officials, concerned that expectations of lower inflation will become self- fulfilling, are debating whether to encourage Americans to believe that prices will start rising at a faster pace so that they would spend more of their money now, the minutes from last month's meeting showed. That would reduce inflation- adjusted interest rates and stimulate the economy. The central bank could also expand its securities holdings, which has in the past been 'successful' at lowering interest rates, Bernanke said. The Fed doesn't have much experience with that tool, which makes it difficult to decide the 'appropriate quantity and pace of purchases and to communicate this policy response to the public,' he said. Bernanke said that 'despite these challenges, the Federal Reserve remains committed to pursuing policies that promote our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability.' The Fed's September statement was the first in almost two years of near-zero interest rates to say that too-low inflation would merit looser monetary policy. Fed staff economists reduced their U.S. growth forecast for the third straight meeting in September. The economy will grow at a slower pace than previously projected in the second half of 2010 and next year, the minutes said. Fed governors and regional presidents last presented economic projections in June and will revise their predictions at the Nov. 2-3 meeting. 'Overall economic growth has been proceeding at a pace that is less vigorous than we would like,' Bernanke said. 'Consumer spending has been inhibited by the painfully slow recovery in the labor market' and 'with long-run inflation expectations stable and with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures, it seems likely that inflation trends will remain subdued for some time,' he said. Bernanke cast doubt on the notion that the unemployment rate has stalled at or above 9.5 percent since August 2009 because of structural changes, a debate that has divided the FOMC. 'We see little evidence that the reallocation of workers across industries and regions is particularly pronounced relative to other periods of recession, suggesting that the pace of structural change is not greater than normal,' Bernanke said. 'Overall, my assessment is that the bulk of the increase in unemployment since the recession began is attributable to the sharp contraction in economic activity.' _ With assistance by Scott Lanman in New York.

1,"When Microsoft introduced its Windows Phone 7 operating system last week, it couldn't make its traditional sales pitch to consumers: We're Microsoft, this product has 'Windows' in its name, get on board now! Instead, it had to ask something different: Trust us to build this platform. You've heard that before from other companies. Smartphones might be the most interesting product of the electronics industry, but the flip side of that excitement is uncertainty. Buying into a new phone platform amounts to placing an expensive bet. The cost of the phone is the last of it; you also have to add in the cost of a required service plan you might not have otherwise bought, the cost of any applications you buy and - most important - the opportunity cost of not being able to switch to a better phone for two years without paying early-termination fees. You have to think like a venture capitalist, but without the potential payoff of riches down the road. Sometimes the bet pays off. Apple had never built a phone before launching the iPhone in 2007, but that venture has succeeded beyond any sane expectation. Google's Android operating system didn't reach the market until after the iPhone had secured an enormous head start, but it's on its way to passing Apple. Sometimes a new phone venture sinks almost instantly. Microsoft axed its Kin line of smartphones less than two months after they arrived in Verizon Wireless stores. They still function fine as phones, but they'll never live up to their advance billing. In other cases, it takes time for a platform to crumble - usually, after years of success tempt companies to slack off. Palm's defunct Palm OS and Microsoft's now-abandoned Windows Mobile come to mind. (When I unloaded an old Palm Treo on eBay, I was happy to make just enough money on the sale to recover the costs of the now-useless Palm programs I'd bought years ago.) Prior to Windows Phone 7's launch, the most uncertain smartphone contender was Palm's webOS. This sleek, multitasking operating system looked like a breakthrough when it debuted on Palm's Pre smartphone two summers ago. But less than a year later, without any significant hardware or software advances and with flagging support from third-party software developers, Palm's project appeared to be circling the drain. Now that HP has bought the company, its prospects look brighter, but only if HP's financial backing helps it ship a reinvigorated lineup of phones with upgraded software that sell well enough to renew the interest of programmers. Windows Phone 7 faces the same basic obstacles, although in some aspects Microsoft seems to be off to a better start than Palm. It has lined up the likes of Dell, HTC, LG and Samsung to build devices running this software, ensuring that its success won't rely on the virtues of a single phone design. And with both AT&T and T-Mobile selling Windows Phone 7 models, it's not requiring that customers all like one carrier - although its failure to build in support for the CDMA wireless technology of Sprint and Verizon still sets this project back. But WP7's software selection seems even more unsettled than Palm's did when the Pre launched. In its favor, count the programs from such name-brand sources as Twitter, eBay, Netflix, EA, Slacker and Amazon's IMDb that Microsoft showed off at its recent launch event in New York. Others are on the way, such as Foursquare's upcoming app. And one of the most important mobile applications, Facebook, comes built into Windows Phone 7. (Note that companies that rush to ship software for new phones face risks of their own: Yelp quickly shipped an app for webOS but now seems to suffer from developer's remorse.) But then consider all the names we haven't heard from yet: Evernote, Dropbox, Kindle, Yelp and Pandora, to name a few popular on the iPhone and Android that have yet to announce WP7 plans. Quantity counts as well as quality, and here Microsoft will inevitably start out light-years behind the iPhone and Android. Microsoft might brag about 'thousands' of apps in the works, but I would be surprised if a four-digit number of apps were available when the first WP7 phone, AT&T's $200 Samsung Focus, ships Nov. 8. For Windows Phone 7 to secure a viable share of the market, that will have to change. Microsoft will have to work with the tenacity of a Chilean miner at getting developers to write apps for these phones - presumably, after they've already put in time on separate iPhone and Android programs. Windows Phone 7 buyers also have to trust that the company will keep plugging away at its own software, adding such missing features as copy and paste (promised for early next year), visual voice mail, video conferencing and voice text input. For all of those obstacles, however, Windows Phone 7 seems a safer bet than this season's other mobile product launch: Research In Motion's PlayBook tablet computer. That device represents RIM's first venture into a new category of hardware, and it doesn't run on the same operating system as RIM's BlackBerry phones, which itself was just updated. Windows Phone 7 has one other thing going for it: Microsoft doesn't have any other options left. Either this platform survives, or the company gets shut out of the most exciting part of the computer industry. "
1,"By claiming ownership of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, President Barack Obama may stem criticism that he hasn't been sufficiently engaged. Avoiding political fallout from what may become the nation's worst environmental disaster will be more difficult. 'It really is a no-win situation,' said Democratic strategist Mike McCurry, who served as former President Bill Clinton's spokesman. 'The consequences environmentally could be dreadful and last for a long, long time.' And while Obama vowed that BP would 'pay every dime they owe for the damage,' the consequences from an ecological catastrophe could also ripple through the economy. In an hour-long White House news conference, Obama Thursday defended his actions so far, saying he and his administration made the spill 'our highest priority' immediately after BP's oil rig caught on fire on April 20 and collapsed. 'I had my team in the Oval Office that first day,' Obama said. 'Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency don't know the facts.' Obama said it's his job to 'get this fixed,' adding, 'I take responsibility.' He suspended oil exploration in two areas off Alaska; canceled pending lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and those that were proposed off Virginia's coast; extended by six months a moratorium on deepwater drilling permits, and suspended operations at all 33 exploratory wells being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. He traveled Friday to the Gulf region for his second visit to Louisiana since the disaster began, but he has a way to go in reassuring the American public. In a USA Today/Gallup Poll, 53 percent of Americans said Obama has done a 'poor' or 'very poor' job handling the spill, compared with 43 percent who said he's done a 'very good' or 'good' job. The poll of 1,049 adults was taken May 24-25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Republicans stepped up their attacks. 'The president under the law has a responsibility to act,' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, the House minority leader. It's 'clear the president has failed in his obligations to the American people to uphold the law.' Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who heads the Senate Republican Conference, cited the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which he said requires presidents to ensure sufficient personnel and equipment are available to clean up oil spills. 'What was the president's cleanup plan and where were the personnel and equipment necessary to implement that plan?' Alexander said in a C-SPAN interview. Other Republicans such as strategist Karl Rove sought to draw parallels between Obama's response and that of former President George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005. The White House and Democratic allies rejected the comparison. And Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said Obama was likely mindful of that criticism when he faced the press Thursday. The president 'probably wanted to just catch up with it and say, `Look, I take full responsibility,' because otherwise his political enemies are attacking him for not doing anything,' Engel said. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., warned of the political peril ahead for the president. 'Once you have a massive blowout, there's no good solution,' he said. 'It doesn't matter who's president. And that's a hard thing for people to accept.' For now, the president's political standing, and the damage to the Gulf, may depend largely on BP's ability to stop the leak. The effort to block the well bore with mud, a procedure called 'top kill' began Wednesday. 'If top kill works, we will probably see today as a turning point that will probably staunch Obama's decline in public-approval ratings on his handling of this,' said Tom Mann, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 'It would allow the government to get involved in something they have some control over, namely the cleanup,' he said. McCurry agreed. 'The important thing is to have some kind of action plan moving forward and have an accountable voice from the administration,' he said. As a result of Obama's appearance Thursday, McCurry said, 'I think people will be saying: `You know, it looks like Obama is doing everything he can do.' But it sure would help them if BP got this thing capped.' With assistance from Kristin Jensen, Catherine Dodge, Nicholas Johnston and Lisa Lerer in Washington. "
1,"If our goal is carbon reduction, a cap-and-trade or carbon-pricing bill, with its likely compromises, would be worse right now than no regulation. Pricing carbon below $40 per ton will not change how industry does business or drive adoption of new technologies. With legislation unlikely to support such prices, uncertainty is better than a low price that disincentivizes the development of technologies that have radically less carbon. Much as Craig Venter used tools for genome sequencing to outrace the larger, longer and costlier government-sponsored human genome project, it makes more sense to focus over the next five years on the development of carbon-reduction technologies rather than on maximizing short-term emissions reduction. Cherry- picking reductions of 5 to 10 percent through low-hanging efficiency upgrades could distract from developing technologies that reduce emissions 80 percent. By focusing instead on the large wedges that account for 75 percent of carbon emissions _ electricity and transportation _ we could achieve the lion's share of our goals with a small fraction of the complexity. If we develop low-cost, high-efficiency technologies upfront, we can spark a wave of adoption and create companies and jobs _ the Googles of the energy sector. Innovation is America's natural advantage, one whose fruits we can export worldwide as other countries seek to adopt cost-effective technologies. Well-designed legislation to reduce carbon emissions in electricity and petroleum could enable the development of substantially better alternative technologies for 70 percent of our carbon emissions, reducing our largest energy security risks. Consider: Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., has proposed requiring electricity providers to use a minimum percentage of energy from renewable sources. If this standard were modified to allow low-carbon electricity from any source, not just renewable, with carbon emissions that are 80 percent lower than coal, it could get support from nuclear, natural gas and even coal advocates. Opening the playing field like this would increase competition and drive down prices. This would encourage coal with sequestration and nuclear technologies to accelerate development to compete. Bipartisan support for such standards is possible because this proposal is not dramatically different from ones by Bingaman, as well as by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., Jim Webb, D-Va., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind. If the proposal passed, we would achieve a technology-neutral, market-based win for climate legislation by reducing emissions from our largest source of carbon. The United States could aim to get 20 to 25 percent of our electricity from sources that use 80 percent less carbon than benchmark coal by 2020, which would meet or exceed the standard set by the House bill passed last June. For utilities, it would reduce uncertainty and encourage investment. Importantly, a low-carbon electricity standard would be superior to a utilities cap. A cap can easily be met in the next 10 years by incremental adjustments to existing assets (such as repowering coal power plants with natural gas and shutting the most inefficient plants). In contrast, a low-carbon electricity standard can be met only by the rapid development of radically low-carbon technology; these technologies can then be exported to India and China, which deploy much of the coal-fired electricity. Such a standard would build low carbon capacity the fastest and give the United States a competitive advantage in the emerging low-carbon economy. The renewable-fuels standard could likewise be modified to a more technology- neutral low-carbon fuels standard, which would reduce concerns about the impact on the food supply, such as corn vs. ethanol, through diversification. Adopting this standard, as California has, would increase energy security and reduce oil risk _ no small feat in light of the threats posed by oil spills and petro- dictators such as Venezuela's Hugo Ch vez or Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Meanwhile, regulating cars in technology-neutral effective grams of carbon emitted per mile, instead of miles per gallon, would allow more efficient engines to compete with electric cars. And compete they should, as some engine technologies may deliver more carbon savings at a fraction of the cost of electric vehicles and hybrids. Furthermore, producing non-food biofuels could be the largest source of new jobs and gross domestic product growth in rural America. Efficiency is another big lever. Why not set up a 'fee-bate system' in which rebates go to those who purchase items that are among the most energy-efficient, be they refrigerators, cars or lighting, while the most inefficient pay fees to fund the rebates? Efficiency standards could update automatically every few years based on the top-tier performers, whose economics and consumer acceptance have been demonstrated. Most important, Washington must stop 'picking winners.' Tax credits and loan guarantees should be equally available to all low-carbon technologies, be they carbon capture and storage, solar, wind or nuclear. Focus on electric cars and hybrids has already decreased investor interest in more-efficient engines. 'Natural gas' trucks are an example of Washington favoring technologies when better paths exist. Why force 'repowering' of coal plants with natural gas when one can be technology-neutral, specifying a certain amount of carbon per megawatt hour, or prefer electric hybrids over more cost-effective and efficient hydraulic hybrids? Between cleaner electricity and transportation, we can start addressing 75 percent of our sources of carbon emissions, while efficiency improvements will reduce emissions in the remaining 25 percent. In the meantime, we can increase energy security and create competitive American companies and sustainable jobs. Climate change may be uncertain to some, but if we take steps to ensure against nuclear attacks, the disruption of oil supplies and acts of terrorism, why not ensure against climate risk? Such actions would increase competition and decrease long-term energy costs. - - - Khosla is founder of the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures, which has interests in several aspects of clean technology, including solar, wind, batteries, carbon sequestration, nuclear, geothermal and biofuels, as well as in energy-efficiency technologies such as engines, electric motors, lighting, air conditioning and the smart grid. "
1,"In signing a new arms treaty with Russia and hosting a major nuclear terrorism summit, President Obama has shown leadership on his pledge to move toward a world without nuclear weapons. But is anyone following? At home, Obama faces a polarized Congress and a public focused on other issues, such as the economy. Although many experts think the Senate will approve the new strategic-arms treaty with Russia, prospects are dim for ratifying another Obama priority: a global pact banning nuclear tests. Internationally, there is also a mixed picture. Obama has won kudos, and a Nobel Peace Prize, for a policy that many perceive as less belligerent than that of President George W. Bush. But George Perkovich, a prominent nuclear expert, noted in a recent report that nuclear powers such as Russia, China and France had not rallied behind the idea of moving toward global disarmament. 'The result is a talented president ready to lead a long-term campaign to remove the existential threats posed by nuclear weapons, but as yet lacking sufficient colleagues and followers to make it happen,' wrote Perkovich, who is at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Obama's policy will face a critical test next month, when nearly 200 countries are to gather at the United Nations to review the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is credited with keeping a lid on the spread of nuclear weapons for four decades. Obama wants to strengthen the pact, which is under severe strain because of Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. The NPT is a bargain that gives all signatories the right to nuclear power while barring them from getting a bomb; the original five nuclear powers could keep their weapons but were to take steps toward disarming. India, Pakistan and Israel, all nuclear weapons states, did not sign the treaty and North Korea quit it in 2003. But it will be difficult to get tougher penalties because the NPT conference operates by consensus. Iran, which is a signatory and maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, could block changes. To critics, the forum often becomes a place where nuclear have-nots bash the nuclear haves, no matter what they do. 'In one sense, the United States will be perceived as genuinely having regained a position of leadership,' said Linton Brooks, a top nuclear official in the past two Republican administrations. 'Whether you'll be able to point to concrete results of that leadership, I simply don't know.' The Obama administration is especially eager to avoid a repeat of the failed 2005 conference, at which the Bush administration was accused of ignoring its own obligations to move toward disarmament. Obama will try to establish his credibility at the conference by pointing to his recent achievements: the U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and his new nuclear policy, which reduces the role of the weapons in U.S. defense strategy. Still, the administration could face trouble from policy contradictions inherited from its predecessors. U.S. presidents have been silent about Israel's nuclear program, which that country does not publicly acknowledge or deny. U.S. officials and analysts worry that the NPT conference could be dominated by a push by Arab states to demand a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the United States, following up on a 2008 deal reached by the Bush administration, struck a deal last month allowing India to get power for its nuclear energy plants by extracting plutonium from spent U.S. nuclear fuel. But because India never signed the NPT, its facilities were not subject to international nuclear inspectors, who could detect whether the plutonium had been diverted to make a bomb. 'The chief problem with this agreement is that the U.S. is allowing a non-NPT member rights that we're not offering to NPT members,' said Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association, an independent group. Pakistan is so unhappy about the India deal that it recently blocked talks on another part of the Obama agenda: getting a treaty banning production of weapons-grade nuclear material. Pakistan's representative to those treaty talks, Zamir Akram, said his government's early optimism about the administration 'had been short-lived.' Administration officials acknowledge that it will not be easy to reach their goals, but they say they have reversed momentum at a moment when the Non- Proliferation Treaty was fraying. Obama has tried to emphasize U.S. support for the treaty in multiple ways: holding arms talks with Russia, promoting access to peaceful nuclear energy, and embracing a goal of eventual global disarmament. 'The fundamental theory of the agenda the president laid out last year is, it takes movement on a whole range of fronts at once to strengthen the NPT and the nonproliferation regime,' said Benjamin Rhodes, the White House director of strategic communications. -0-< Staff writer Steven Mufson contributed to this report.

1,"WASHINGTON - It's hard to read this week's election results, and the public opinion polls generally, and not be concerned about the collapse of the political center. I disagree with my Post colleague E.J. Dionne that this is strictly a Republican phenomenon, in which the 'tea party'' and other anti-government zealots are in the final stages of driving out experienced, thoughtful moderates from the Republican Party. The dynamic on the Democratic side is as much about interest group politics as it is about political ideology. But you don't have to look hard to find it in President Obama's declining poll numbers. Obama is perhaps the classic case of the unloved office-holder trying to govern from the center and accommodate his liberal program to political and practical realities. By declining to pull troops immediately out of Iraq and Afghanistan or fight for a single-payer health plan or bring Wall Street to its knees he has lost the enthusiastic support of the moveon.org liberals, even as economically anxious moderates and independents fall prey to misguided propaganda about a government takeover of the economy. The president's loss of popularity is now being felt most keenly by moderate Democrats from Republican-leaning districts who were swept into office two years ago on the anti-Bush tide. Their defeat in November, combined with the intransigence of a newly empowered Republican leadership, will leave the centrist president even more dependent and politically beholden to the far left wing of his party. This trend toward polarization has been developing for some time, aided and abetted by an increasingly fragmented news media and a rising tide of special- interest spending on campaigns and issue advocacy. We've reached a point, however, where a vicious and self-reinforcing political and economic cycle has taken hold - one in which a lack of sustained growth and widely shared prosperity leads to political polarization, which by paralyzing government leads to even slower growth and even less widely shared prosperity and yet more polarization. This interplay between the politics and the economics is the subject of a provocative new book, 'Winner Take All Politics,' by political scientists Jacob Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of the University of California at Berkeley. While slowing growth and rising inequality have afflicted all advanced economies in recent decades as a result of globalization and new technologies, Hacker and Pierson find them to be more pronounced in the United States, as this week's report on the nation's soaring poverty rate attests. Conservatives like to ascribe such trends to the natural dynamics of efficiency-producing, liberty- protecting markets, but Hacker and Pierson remind us that there are no such thing as 'pure' markets, and that markets everywhere are shaped by laws and regulations, cultures and the institutional arrangements that themselves are shaped by the political process. Less convincing is the Hacker-Pierson thesis that U.S. markets have now been captured by a clever and carefully-plotted right-wing conspiracy to screw the American middle class. At the same time, it's pretty clear that the government's ability to respond to what most Americans experience as unsatisfactory economic performance has largely been thwarted by a political process rendered dysfunctional by partisan and ideological polarization. One obvious recent exception was Washington's dramatic and successful response to the financial crisis two years ago, which briefly enjoyed broad support from political and business leaders. But no sooner had it succeeded than everyone rushed back to their corners to declare it a failure and a political abomination. We saw another small example this week regarding the new consumer financial protection agency established under the financial regulation legislation passed by Congress over the summer. The agency represents precisely the kind of check on markets that can even out the distribution of income a bit by sparing middle- class households the financial hardship and ruin caused by abusive lending practices while reducing the fees and profits that might be earned by bankers and other titans of finance. But because of the total breakdown in comity and majority rule in the Senate, the new agency will be run for its first two years not by a director nominated by the president and confirmed by a majority of the Senate, but by a special assistant to the president and Treasury secretary. Whatever you might think about the appointment of Elizabeth Warren, however, using this clever maneuver to circumvent the law will inevitably add to the polarization and the paralysis and make it less likely that Congress will be able to stimulate job creation, balance the budget, reform the tax code, clean up the immigration mess and accelerate investment in clean energy and infrastructure. This is the way wealthy nations become poor. There are no vibrant economies without effective political systems, and there are no effective political systems without a vibrant center. A Hatfields-and-McCoys politics produces a Hatfields-and-McCoys economy (it works the other way as well). In the end, there are no winners - except, perhaps, for the Chinese. "
1,"Thousands of Chinese troops flooded into this city Wednesday to separate feuding ethnic groups after three days of communal violence left 156 people dead, and a senior Communist Party official vowed to execute those guilty of murder in the rioting in western China. Long convoys of armored cars and green troop trucks with riot police rumbled through Urumqi, a city of 2.3 million people. Other security forces carrying automatic rifles with bayonets formed cordons to defend Muslim neighborhoods from marauding groups of vigilantes with sticks. Military helicopters buzzed over Xinjiang's regional capital, dropping pamphlets urging people to stay in their homes and stop fighting. Special police from other provinces were called in to patrol the city. The crisis was so severe that President Hu Jintao cut short a trip to Italy, where he was to participate in a Group of Eight summit. It was an embarrassing move for a leader who wants to show that China has a harmonious society as it prepares to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Communist rule. The heightened security came amid the worst spasm of ethnic violence in decades in Xinjiang -- a sprawling, oil-rich territory that borders Pakistan, Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries. The region is home to the Uighur ethnic minority, who rioted Sunday and attacked the Han Chinese -- the nation's biggest ethnic group -- after holding a protest that was ended by police. Officials have said 156 people were killed as the Turkic-speaking Uighurs ran amok in the city, beating and stabbing the Han Chinese. The Uighurs allege that trigger-happy security forces gunned down many of the protesters, and officials have yet to give an ethnic breakdown of those killed. Li Zhi, the highest-ranking Communist Party official in Urumqi, told reporters that some of the rioters were university students who were misled and didn't understand what they were doing. They would be treated leniently, he said, as long as they weren't involved in serious acts of violence and vandalism. But Li added: 'To those who committed crimes with cruel means, we will execute them.' He also repeated allegations that the riot was whipped up by U.S.-exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer and her overseas supporters. 'They're afraid to see our economic prosperity. They're afraid to see our ethnic unity and the people living a stable, prosperous life,' he said. Kadeer has denied masterminding the violence, and many Uighurs laughed off the notion that they were puppets of groups abroad. 'Not even a 3-year-old would believe that Rebiya stirred this up. It's ridiculous,' said a shopkeeper who only identified himself as Ahmet. Like other Uighurs, he declined to give his full name because he feared the police would detain him. Ahmet was quick to rattle off a long list of grievances commonly mentioned by Uighurs. He accused the Han Chinese of discrimination and alleged that government policies were forcing them to abandon their culture, language and Islamic faith. 'After all this rioting, I'm still filled with hatred. I'm not afraid of the Han Chinese,' Ahmet said. His neighborhood in southern Urumqi was targeted by mobs of Han Chinese who roamed the capital Tuesday seeking revenge. Ahmet's friends had video shot by mobile phones and cameras that showed the stick-wielding Han men beating Uighurs. He pointed to blood stains on a white concrete apartment wall, where he said a Uighur was severely stabbed. A Uighur college student who called herself Parizat added, 'The men were carrying a Chinese flag. I never thought something like this would happen. We're all Chinese citizens.' The Uighurs accused paramilitary police of allowing the Han Chinese to attack their neighbors. But in the video, the troops appeared to be trying to block or restrain the mobs. On Wednesday, the government warned residents against carrying weapons on the street, and most people generally complied. But there were groups of Han Chinese who tried to find soft spots in police cordons and rush into Uighur neighborhoods. One such failed attempt sent a wave of terror and panic through the biggest Uighur neighborhood, Er Dao Qiao. When someone yelled, 'The Han are coming!' children scampered indoors and women ran shrieking through a backstreet market with carts of watermelons, shops selling cold soft drinks and smoky grills with sizzling lamb kebabs. Within seconds, the men armed themselves with spears stashed behind doors and under market stands. The weapons were long poles with knives and meat cleavers tied to the ends. Piles of rocks were placed across the street for ammunition. One Uighur graduate student who called himself Memet greeted a foreign reporter in English by saying, 'Welcome to the jungle!' 'I think the Uighur people lately are kind of happy. You can see it in their eyes, a bit of happiness. We've spoken up. People know we exist now,' he said. The ethnic hatred in Xinjiang appears to run so deep that many Uighurs won't express sorrow for the Han Chinese who were attacked Sunday. One of them was Dong Yuanyuan, 24, a newlywed who said she was on a bus with her husband getting ready to leave on their honeymoon. She said Uighur attackers dragged them off the bus and beat them until they were unconscious. Her husband was still missing, said the woman, who had abrasions on her face, arms and knees. 'My aunts have been going to all the hospitals to search for him. He must still be unconscious,' she told reporters who joined a government tour at the People's Hospital. Another victim was Ma Weihong, who said she was walking home from a park with her 10-year-old son when the riot started. The boy suffered minor injuries, but the mother had a broken arm and wrist, missing teeth and head wounds. 'The stores all closed up and we tried to run for home,' she said. 'That is when they caught us. We couldn't get away.' "
1,"Serious street clashes erupted between rioting youths and police in central Athens Thursday as some 30,000 people demonstrated during a nationwide strike against the cash-strapped government's austerity measures. Hundreds of masked and hooded youths punched and kicked motorcycle police, knocking several off their bikes, as riot police responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades. The violence spread after the end of the march to a nearby square, where police faced off with stone-throwing anarchists and suffocating clouds of tear gas sent patrons scurrying from open-air cafes. Police say 12 suspected rioters were detained and two officers were injured. Rioters used sledge hammers to smash the glass fronts of more than a dozen shops, banks, jewelers and a cinema. Youths also set fire to rubbish bins and a car, smashed bus stops, and chopped blocks off marble balustrades and building facades to use as projectiles. Thursday's strike -- the second in a week -- brought the country to a virtual standstill, grounding all flights and bringing public transport to a halt. State hospitals were left with emergency staff only and all news broadcasts were suspended as workers walked off the job for 24 hours to protest spending cuts and tax hikes designed to tackle the country's debt crisis. Riot police made heavy use of tear gas during the start-and-stop clashes throughout the demonstration, including outside Parliament. Strikers and protesters banged drums and chanted slogans such as 'no sacrifice for plutocracy,' and 'real jobs, higher pay.' People draped banners from apartment buildings reading: 'No more sacrifices, war against war.' The demonstrators included hundreds of black-clad anarchists in crash helmets and ski masks, who repeatedly taunted and attacked riot police with stones and petrol bombs, at one point spraying officers with brown paint. Shopkeepers along the demonstration route hastily rolled down their shutters, while a few blocks away, people sat at outdoor restaurants, nonchalantly continuing their meals. Tear gas wafted through the city center's streets, sending businessmen in suits scurrying for cover, their eyes streaming. Minor clashes also broke out in the northern city of Thessaloniki, where about 14,000 people marched through the center. Fears of a Greek default have undermined the euro for all 16 countries that share it, putting the Greek government under intense European Union pressure to quickly show fiscal improvement. It has announced an additional (EURO)4,8 billion ($65.33 billion) in savings through public sector salary cuts, hiring and pension freezes and consumer tax hikes to deal with its ballooning deficit, but the measures have led to a new wave of labor discontent. The cutbacks, added to a previous (EURO)11.2 billion ($15.24 billion) austerity plan, seek to reduce the country's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of annual output to 8.7 percent this year. The long-term target is to bring overspending below the EU ceiling of 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The new plan sparked a wave of strikes and protests from labor unions whose reaction to the initial austerity measures had been muted. Thursday's strike shut down all public services and schools, leaving ferries tied up at port and suspending all news broadcasts for the day. However, some private bank branches were open despite calls from the bank employees' union to participate in the strike. While their colleagues clashed with groups of protesters, some police joined the demonstration. About 200 uniformed police, coast guard and fire brigade officers, who cannot go on strike but can hold protests, gathered at a square in the center of the city shortly before the marches got under way. 'The police and other security forces have been particularly hard hit by the new measures because our salaries are very low,' said Yiannis Fanariotis, general secretary of one police association. He said the average policeman made about (EURO)1,000-(EURO)1,200 ($1,360-$1,635) a month if weekend and night shifts were included. Joining the protest 'doesn't feel strange, because we are working people like everybody else and we are all shouting out for our rights,' he said. The government says the tough cuts are its only way to dig Greece out of a crisis that has hammered the common European currency and alarmed international markets -- inflating the loan-dependent country's borrowing costs. But unions say ordinary Greeks are being called to pay a disproportionate price for past fiscal mismanagement. 'They are trying to make workers pay the price for this crisis,' said Yiannis Panagopoulos, leader of Greece's largest union, the GSEE. 'These measures will not be effective and will throw the economy into deep freeze.' A general strike last Friday was marred by violence during a large protest march. Riot police used tear gas and baton charges against rock-throwing protesters, who smashed banks and storefronts, while left-wing protesters roughed up Panagopoulos as he was addressing a rally. The labor unrest could spark fears that the government will have trouble in implementing its new measures. Greece insists it doesn't need a bailout, and its European partners are reluctant to fund one. But it has called for European and international support for its program, saying that unless it receives that support and the cost for it to borrow on the market falls, it might have to appeal to the International Monetary Fund for help. On Wednesday night, Deputy Prime Minister Theodore Pangalos said Greece could bypass the costly process of borrowing from edgy markets by urging international institutions to buy its bonds at a set interest rate. 'We want, if there is an unjustified speculative attack against Greek bonds, to know that one of these institutions that have the substantial means to absorb such market products will come and say 'look here, I am buying Greek bonds at this price, with this interest rate,'' Pangalos told private Mega TV. He did not say which institutions he was referring to, or elaborate on the interest rate. Markets think some kind of rescue would be organized if default looms. Speculation has focused on possible guarantees for Greek bonds or help from state-owned banks in other eurozone countries. "
1,"The Blue Dogs want you to believe that, unlike those other profligate politicians, they really, really care about bringing the federal budget deficit under control, even in the midst of the worst economy in 75 years. That's why the caucus of fiscally conservative House Democrats insisted last week that their party leaders strip out nearly $30 billion in funding for health-care coverage for the poor and the unemployed from emergency legislation extending jobless benefits. It's not that we're heartless, they explained, it's just that the country can't afford it. All of which raises the question of why the Blue Dogs couldn't muster the same fiscal discipline when it came to spending $22 billion over the next three years to guarantee that American doctors, who are far and away the best-paid in the world, don't suffer any significant declines in their incomes just because of a little thing like a recession or a government budget crisis. Given the choice between protecting high-income docs and economically struggling patients, those courageous Blue Dogs sided with the docs. What the Blue Dogs have bought into, like many in Washington, is that physicians in private practice have a divine right to earn on average five times what their patients do. The legislative expression of this divine right is the 'doctor fix,' a periodic budget ritual designed to override a 13-year-old law aimed at keeping Medicare spending growing no faster than the rest of the economy. The idea behind this spending cap is that it would encourage doctors to rein in growth in wasteful and unnecessary care because if they didn't, they would face reductions in fees they receive from Medicare for each visit and procedure. What has happened instead is that the volume of medical services has continued to expand rapidly. But just as the automatic fee reductions are about to kick in, the American Medical Association comes rushing to Washington to demand that the fee cuts be suspended. The explicit threat from the AMA is that if its demands are not met, doctors will refuse to take Medicare patients, and the elderly will go untreated. Every time, Congress and the president have acceded to these un-Hippocratic ransoms. As a result, although Medicare physician fees haven't quite kept up with the other costs of running a doctor's office, this modest gap has been more than offset by the increased volume of services. Total physician income from Medicare has continued to rise. None of that was mentioned by James Rohack, the president of the AMA, in his defense of the doctor fix on C-SPAN last week. He was quick to bring up those huge medical-school loans and, of course, the physician's bugaboo, those 'skyrocketing' malpractice premiums. But somehow Dr. Rohack failed to mention the biggest cost of all for any medical practice: the generous salaries that physicians pay themselves. The AMA, of course, doesn't want you to think of the doctor fix as just another government entitlement program for economically comfortable physicians. Nor do they want you to do the back-of-the-envelope calculation that shows that the fix works out to a benefit of $20,000 on average for the physicians actively participating in the Medicare program. None of this would be particularly outrageous but for the fact that, at the same time the House was scraping together the $22 billion to pay for another 'doctor fix' last week, it could not find $7 billion to continue providing subsidies to help those who had been laid off keep up with health insurance premiums under the COBRA program. Without those subsidies, premium payments for a family policy will typically consume 80 percent or more of a worker's unemployment check, according to Families USA, a liberal advocacy group. Nor could House leaders find the $24 billion over the next year to extend a temporary increase in federal support for cash-strapped state Medicaid programs that provide health care for the poorest families. The likely result is that hundreds of thousands of people will be thrown off the program and forced to go without insurance. Leadership on fiscal issues demands more than simply caving in to the politics of tea-ism. It requires the economic sense to know when to say no to deficit spending and the political courage to know what spending to cut. The Blue Dogs have recently shown neither. With unemployment still stubbornly high and most states facing massive budget shortfalls, cutting back on health care for the poor and the unemployed is at once shortsighted and mean-spirited. The irony is, of course, that much of that money for Medicaid and COBRA would eventually have made its way into the hands of doctors and other health professionals. Instead, those clever Blue Dogs have found a way to get the docs the money to maintain their lifestyles, but without having to provide the extra care. That's a lousy set of policy trade-offs, one that a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic president, should have the wisdom to reject. "
1,"WASHINGTON - A new book by Bob Woodward on the Obama administration's Afghan war deliberations presents three generals in the White House and State Department as the military's toughest, most persistent and most skeptical critics. President Barack Obama, who took office with relatively little experience with the military, tapped the generals for key positions that are traditionally filled by civilians. The selections led some critics to complain that the appointments amounted to the militarization of the administration's foreign policy. The Woodward book, however, consistently shows the three officers - retired Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, retired Gen. James Jones and Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute - embroiled in heated disputes with the brass. Lute, the National Security Council's unofficial 'war czar' and sole active-duty general among the group, is portrayed as among the biggest skeptics of the military's strategy to send a surge of more than 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan in an effort to shift the momentum away from the Taliban. In late November, as the president made the decision to escalate the U.S. commitment to the war, Lute warned him that the approach was unlikely to succeed. 'Mr. President, you don't have to do this,' Woodward quotes Lute as saying. The Army general maintained that the Taliban's ability to exploit Pakistani safe havens, persistent corruption within the Afghan government, and the poor state of the Afghan security forces made it unlikely that the surge of forces would produce major changes in Afghanistan by July 2011. Lute's strident questioning of the military's preferred strategy drew a stern rebuke from Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military's top officer. 'The secretary and I believe you weren't always helpful in the course of the review,' Mullen is quoted as telling Lute. 'I hope the president doesn't have the same view,' Lute responded. The Pentagon declined to comment on the revelations in Woodward's book. 'We're not in the business of offering literary criticism, and we are not going to start now,' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. 'Our focus is on the mission moving forward in Afghanistan.' Senior White House officials didn't dispute Woodward's depiction of the policy review as an emotional and often contentious process. They said the president is depicted in the account as decisive, willing to challenge the military brass and deeply engaged in the war effort. The detailed meeting-by-meeting account, titled 'Obama's Wars,' describes how the top military and civilian officials in the Pentagon essentially barred the serious consideration of any course of action that involved deploying fewer than the 30,000 additional troops that Obama eventually approved. Despite the critiques from Lute, Jones and Eikenberry, the only options that received serious consideration from the White House involved between 30,000 and 40,000 more troops. Obama selected Eikenberry and Jones and retained Lute, who was a holdover from the Bush administration, to compensate for his own lack of experience and contacts with the military. Each of the three registered their concerns about the strategy in different ways. In early November 2009, Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Kabul, drafted a cable that was sharply critical of the military's counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan, saying it was likely to both 'increase Afghan dependency' on the United States and force the U.S. government to incur 'vastly increased costs.' Jones, Obama's national security adviser, similarly was able to use his contacts in the Pentagon and knowledge of how the military's vast bureaucracy functions to question the Pentagon's requests for forces. The three generals' efforts, however, seem to have had only a modest influence on the final war strategy - in part because top Pentagon officials such as Mullen, Gen. David Petraeus and Defense Secretary Robert Gates presented a united front in opposition to deploying any fewer than 30,000 additional troops. Despite continuing high levels of violence in Afghanistan and ebbing popular support for the war effort, the often heated debate surrounding the war strategy has moderated in recent weeks. Both administration and Pentagon officials portray an upcoming December review of the strategy as unlikely to produce any major changes in approach. 'This will be about fine-tuning,' said a senior Pentagon official. 'It is not going to be another review like the fall.' The next major question facing Obama is how quickly he will begin to pull troops out of Afghanistan after July 2011, his stated deadline to begin the withdrawal process. Petraeus, who took over as top commander in Afghanistan earlier this summer, has advocated a gradual removal as responsibility for security is shifted to the Afghans. Gates and Petraeus have said that the U.S. troop surge and strategy focused on protecting the Afghan people from Taliban insurgents appear to be showing tentative signs of progress. But concerns remain about the competence of the Afghan security forces and President Hamid Karzai's government, which is deeply unpopular among Afghans and perceived as corrupt. Most military officials in Afghanistan cite poor governance and corruption as the major factors driving the insurgency. Although the United States in engaged in large-scale operations to drive the Taliban from population centers in the south and the east, military officials complain that there is still no coherent strategy to deal with governance and corruption problems. "
1,"It was bad when the Washington Hospital Center fired 18 nurses during last winter's blizzards. It got worse when the nurses union and management failed to negotiate a new contract in the summer. Then last week, the hospital effectively cut take-home pay for most nurses. As WHC nurses voted overwhelmingly Tuesday night to join the largest nurses union in the country, labor relations at the area's biggest hospital were tense. 'People are really angry,' said one veteran nurse, referring to the way hospital officials forced through a plan that increases base pay but cuts shift pay for working evenings, nights and weekends - action that the hospital said it took only after more than 100 proposals and counterproposals and two months of silence from the union. The labor dispute reflects growing rancor across the country at a time when the role nurses play in the country's evolving health-care system is set to become more critical then ever: The success of the sweeping health-care legislation will depend heavily on primary-care givers, such as nurses, whom President Obama has called 'the beating heart of health care.' The country's more than 3 million nurses already make up the largest segment of the health-care work force. Millions more will be needed to take care of the 32 million additional people who are estimated to get health insurance coverage in 2014. The quality of care nurses provide will also be crucial as hospitals will increasingly be paid for how well they take care of patients rather than how many procedures and tests they perform. Better nurse staffing and work environments are linked to fewer hospital readmissions, hospital-acquired infections and bedsores, experts say. 'Our research has shown that nurses are the single most important factor in how satisfied patients are with hospital care,' said Linda Aiken, director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania. But during a recession, with their salaries being targeted, nurses across the country are unhappy: In Minnesota 12,000 nurses from 14 hospitals narrowly averted the biggest nursing strike in U.S. history in July after a dispute over staffing and benefits. In Philadelphia, 1,500 nurses and health-care workers had a 28-day work stoppage at Temple University Hospital in April over benefit cuts. In Oakland, Calif., nurses at Children's Hospital Oakland voted last month to authorize a strike to protest efforts to reduce their health-care coverage. For nurses, changes in the delivery of and payment for care are occurring at the same time that patients are sicker than before and the use of sophisticated technology is increasing. Coupled with chronic understaffing and high turnover, the pressures on nurses are enormous. In the WHC pulmonary step-down unit where many patients go after leaving intensive care, one nurse often has to care for four patients on respirators, said nurse Blondina Mays. That's double what it used to be when she started at the hospital 11 years ago. In labor and delivery, two nurses are supposed to be in attendance for every delivery, but 'we do it when we can, it just depends,' said one veteran nurse who did not want to be identified. Many teenagers having babies for the first time need teaching and support, but nurses often only have time to do the minimum, taking vital signs and checking medications. 'I feel like I'm not doing the job I want to do,' said the nurse, who has more than 20 years experience in labor and delivery. 'I'm not doing a good job of taking care of them, of meeting the emotional needs.' Sometimes, that can be as simple as holding a patient's hand, or helping brush their teeth. When she squeezes that in, patients are so grateful. 'It just breaks my heart,' she said. Nurses say the contract dispute has accelerated turnover. In April, 27 nurses left, followed by 27 in May, 30 in June, 35 in July and 18 in August, according to hospital data. This year's annual turnover rate is 17 percent, up from 14.4 percent the year before. Beth Pruski, 36, left in August. She was a staff nurse who took part in a 47-day strike in 2000 at the hospital. As primary breadwinner, Pruski didn't want to take any chances this time. 'I need a full-time job. I needed health benefits,' said Pruski, who found another nursing job. It's unclear what happens next for the 1,600 nurses at the 926-bed hospital center. The hospital's action to impose its wage plan angered nurses, who turned out in record numbers to vote to affiliate with the national nurses union, said Stephen Frum, chief shop steward for the local Nurses United union. Voting ended Tuesday night with 1,121 in favor of joining National Nurses United, 66 against, and three abstentions. The national union, formed in December with about 155,000 members, has been actively organizing across the country. WHC nurses say they hope the affiliation will give them more clout. Executives at Washington Hospital Center, part of the $3.8 billion nonprofit Medstar Health system that is the region's largest health system and also owns Georgetown University Hospital, say they are under enormous pressure to trim costs. Because of the recession, patients continue to delay or forgo care because budgets remain tight. Patient admissions at Washington Hospital Center, like elsewhere, were down last year. Most patients have little or no insurance, so cost-cutting is essential if the hospital is to survive, said Janis Orlowski, the chief medical officer. Under the plan imposed last week, most nurses will get an increase in base pay of 4.5 percent to 6.75 percent over three years, she said. But most will have take-home pay cut because of cuts in pay for shifts. Last year, the union said the average nurse earned $74,000; managers say it was $93,000. 'We have tremendous respect for our nurses. This was a business management decision,' Orlowski said. (Optional Add End) The hospital is also committed to safe staffing levels; more than 200 new nurses will be on board by Oct. 18, and another 200 and 70 more patient care aides are to be hired by next June, officials said. Although they acknowledge that patients are generally sicker than before, the overall number of nurses has increased since 2004 while hospital admissions have decreased. Earlier this year, the two sides agreed to a staffing matrix that sets goals for the number of nurses needed for each shift. But Tonya Washington, who heads nursing, said goals aren't always met. More important, the labor dispute has prevented this critical measure from being put in place as policy. At the moment, the recession has made for an unusually tight market for nurses. But the health-care overhaul is expected to change that. New health-care organizations, where doctors and hospitals team up to provide total care for patients, will mean more jobs for nurses outside hospitals, their traditional workplace. 'Health reform will create a lot of opportunities for nurses, and this is just going to put competitive pressure on hospitals to attract and keep nurses,' said the University of Pennsylvania's Aiken. "
1,"The father of a woman misidentified after a deadly Arizona traffic crash said the hospital mixed up the families, not the victims. Frank Cantu said Monday that the hospital used information provided by the families to correctly determine it was 19-year-old Abby Guerra who survived the July 18 crash -- not his 21-year-old daughter, Marlena Cantu. But he said hospital staff mistakenly came to him and said the critically injured woman was his daughter. Frank Cantu said Guerra was then assumed to be the woman killed at the scene. A spokesman for St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix didn't immediately return a call seeking comment Monday night. At a news conference earlier Monday, the hospital's vice president of external affairs, Suzanne Pfister, said the patient wasn't easily identified because she was badly injured and doctors were struggling to keep her alive. 'The hospital does not conduct fingerprinting nor do dental records in the middle of a trauma situation, because the overwhelming emphasis is on saving the patient's life,' Pfister said. She said the hospital identified the patient as Cantu after asking family members about recognizable marks, scars or bone breaks. She declined to say what features were used in the identification, citing the Guerra family's request for privacy. Sgt. Kevin Wood, Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman, added officers and hospital staff spent about five hours trying to identify the patient. Frank Cantu said the family was asked for traits to easily identify the young women, and Guerra's mother said her daughter had an identifiable mark on her chest. Cantu said a hospital worker went to check the patient and returned to Cantu and told him the patient was his daughter. 'They talked to the wrong person,' he said. Guerra's family was then told their daughter had died at the scene, he said. The mistake wasn't discovered until Saturday -- after the Maricopa County medical examiner's office completed an autopsy and sought a comparison of the women's dental records. Cantu and Guerra were among a group of five friends from Ironwood High School in Glendale, near Phoenix, who were returning from Disneyland when the sport utility vehicle they were in blew a tire. The driver lost control, and the SUV rolled several times. One of the five -- 20-year-old Tyler Parker -- was taken to St. Joseph's, where he died the next day. A woman believed to be Cantu and another person suffered head trauma and were also taken to St. Joseph's. Another woman, believed to be Guerra, was pronounced dead at the scene. Guerra's family spent the past week planning her funeral, and teammates from her University of Evansville soccer team in Indiana were preparing to travel to Phoenix to attend the services. On Saturday, they rushed to her bedside after learning of the mix-up. Guerra, a nursing major, was scheduled to begin her sophomore year at the University of Evansville this fall. The Cantu Family said they have established a memorial fund where donations can be made in Marlena's honor. Frank Cantu said earlier Monday he's not blaming anyone for what happened yet, but he hopes something can be done to prevent similar mistakes in the future. 'We want to find a better solution,' he said. 'We don't want this to happen to anybody else.' Right now, he said, he just can't believe his daughter is gone. 'It's unbearable right now,' he said. 'To lose her, it's just losing a big part of my life.' A similar ID mix-up following a 2006 traffic crash in Indiana involving two women led to a new law in that state. It requires coroners to use one of four methods to identify a dead person: fingerprints, DNA analysis, dental records or positive identification by an immediate family member. In that case, the two young women were similar in appearance, and the family of the one who died had kept vigil for five weeks at the bedside of the survivor, Whitney Cerak, believing she was their daughter. Cerak's family had buried 22-year-old Laura VanRyn's body, believing she was Whitney. "
1,"Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, 25 and just out of La Scala's academy, was showered with flowers for her debut performance in the title role of Bizet's 'Carmen' on La Scala's gala season opening night Monday. One flower even hit Rachvelishvili squarely on the face. Showing surprise, she brushed her cheek with a laugh, knelt before the crowd in gratitude and then blew kisses back. 'I heard and I understood that she had a special voice, but talent isn't enough, and she showed herself to be a great artist,' conductor Daniel Barenboim told reporters backstage. 'The Georgian should be proud to have a voice like that, and this evening she should go out into the piazza as if she won a world medal.' Barenboim triumphed with his second gala opening since becoming La Scala's principal guest conductor. The crowd applauded for nearly 15 minutes, raining flowers and shouts of 'Bravi!' down on tenor Jonas Kaufmann as Don Jose, Uruguayan baritone Erwin Schrott as Escamillo and soprano Adriana Damato as Micaela -- as well as the conductor himself. 'This Carmen will be legend,' Barenboim prophesied afterward. Tenor Pacido Domingo, passing by backstage, said he liked the production very much. 'But I need to preserve by voice for the day after tomorrow,' he said before rushing out. Domingo is celebrating 40 years at La Scala with a gala performance on Wednesday. But the applause for 'Carmen' was punctuated by boos for the stage direction by Emma Dante, a 40-year-old theater director known in Italy for her experimental productions who was making her debut in the opera world. Before taking the job, the Sicilian-born Dante had never set foot in La Scala. Dante's scenery was spare, but she filled the stage with dancing choruses and thought-provoking imagery. There also were strong allusions to Catholicism, including a swinging incense burner and a shattered crucifix. In the final scene, Don Jose rapes Carmen under the gaze of a clergyman in the background. The sequence is so explicit that it risked overshadowing the climax event, Carmen's murder at the hands of her former lover, Don Jose. Barenboim showed his solidarity by bringing Dante back out through the closed curtain to face the audience, holding her arm tightly as she rested her head against his shoulder. The crowd of cultural figures, captains of industry and political leaders sitting the orchestra seats clapped loudly as if to drown out the boos from La Scala's upper most balconies, populated by the opera house's notoriously harsh amateur critics. If it was too original for some in the crowd, La Scala's management stood firmly behind Dante. 'It will become a classic,' said general manager Stephane Lissner. 'After two or three performances, everyone will understand the importance of the work that was staged today with the direction of Emma Dante.' Umberto Veronesi, Italy's most famous cancer researcher and a former health minister, said the opera had created 'a great atmosphere of reinvention. Finally, a little light after an atmosphere of conformity in these last years.' One of the most highly anticipated cultural events of the season in Europe, the gala premiere is often attended by foreign dignitaries, captains of industry and cultural icons. Italian president Giorgio Napolitano was joined by Gabon President Ali Bongo and Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade. Author Dan Brown, who has used Italy as a backdrop for his novels 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angel and Demons' was in the audience. Asked if he was taking inspiration for future novels, Brown said: 'It is quite possible. I'm mesmerized by this.' Among the details that caught his eye: 'The architecture, the art, and of course you have an endless cast of characters that can be built on,' Brown said during a break. By tradition, La Scala opens it season on Dec. 7, the day honoring Milan's patron saint Ambrose. In contrast with recent years when labor disputes and tenor drama threatened to overshadow the event, this year's premiere seems to be all about the music. Rachvelishvili mad her debut on La Scala's stage as the feisty, independent Carmen. Born in Tbilisi, Rachvelishvili has told Italian media that her musical preferences ran toward rock music, and that she had to be pushed toward classical. Barenboim said recently that she was being auditioned for a lesser role when he realized: 'Why Mercedes? She is our Carmen.' "
1,"China has found another 170 tons of tainted milk powder in an emergency crackdown that has made it increasingly clear many products discovered in the country's 2008 milk scandal were repackaged for sale instead of destroyed. The growing number of cases in recent weeks challenges the government's earlier promise to overhaul its approach to food safety after hundreds of thousands of children in that scandal were sickened by milk products tainted with an industrial chemical. At least six children died. Already, tainted milk products have recently emerged in China's largest city, Shanghai, and in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Guizhou, Jilin and Hebei. China's 10-day emergency crackdown on the products is set to end Wednesday, and it was not clear whether it would be extended. The country's biggest holiday, the Lunar New Year, starts this weekend, and already some offices are closing and millions of people are going on vacation. In the latest discovery, officials recalled more than 170 tons of milk powder tainted by the industrial chemical melamine and closed two dairy companies in the northern region of Ningxia, the China Daily newspaper reported Monday. The report said officials seized 72 tons of the powder but were still looking for the rest, which had been repackaged by the Ningxia Tiantian Dairy Co. Ltd. and sold to factories in the neighboring region of Inner Mongolia and the bustling southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. Dairy suppliers in the past have been accused of adding melamine, which is high in nitrogen, to watered-down milk to make it appear protein-rich in quality tests that measure nitrogen. The report said the tainted powder should have been destroyed in the 2008 scandal, and that Ningxia Tiantian Dairy got it from an unnamed company as a debt payment. 'Our small companies were in total trust of their partners because they've been doing business and having good relations with them for a long time,' Zhao Shuming, secretary-general of the Ningxia Dairy Industry Association, told The Associated Press. 'They didn't expect those companies would hurt them.' China Daily quoted Zhao as saying many small dairies, including Ningxia Tiantian, don't have the technology to even test for melamine. 'Flaws in the previous system led to the current chaos. What if companies with tainted milk also hold back their stocks for this round of checkups and reuse them later, just like what's happening now?' the newspaper quoted him as saying. Zhao spoke more carefully Monday, telling the AP, 'We have strict checks and our client companies have strict checks too.' The 2008 milk scandal was China's worst food safety crisis in years. Chinese officials knew tracking and getting rid of the tainted milk products from the scandal would be difficult, and it didn't promise to destroy seized products itself. Instead, it issued guidelines on how to destroy the tainted products, suggesting they be burned in large-capacity incinerators or that small amounts be buried in landfills. In the southern city of Guangzhou, however, the local government took over the disposal after one garbage company poured tainted milk into a city river. China also issued a new food safety law last summer that places more responsibility on food producers to ensure their products are safe. "
1,"Chrysler is bringing back its one-time Washington lobbyist as a special adviser to the automaker's chief executive Sergio Marchionne. The company said Wednesday that Robert Liberatore will work with Marchionne on an interim basis. He is expected to provide advice on external affairs for the company. Marchionne, is CEO of Italy's Fiat Group SpA. Fiat was given a 20 percent stake in Chrysler by the U.S. government and may gain more if it hits certain government targets, which include producing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Liberatore worked for Chrysler from 1985, spending much of that time as the company's top lobbyist. He retired in 2007 as a group vice president. "
1,"Bono and U2 rocked more than 80,000 fans in Dublin as the Irish supergroup's latest world tour hit new emotional highs Friday night on home soil. A deafening roar welcomed the Dubliners as they launched their three-concert homestand at Croke Park, Ireland's biggest stadium and a cathedral to Irish nationalism. The band's '360' tour -- featuring its underselling 12th studio album, 'No Line on the Horizon' -- switches from Europe to North America in September. 'We are so young -- as a nation!' shouted the 49-year-old lead singer Bono. Crowds braced for downpours threw their raincoats aside as an unexpected sunset gave way to a starry Dublin night. All of the '360' concerts feature a stunning feat of engineering: the four-taloned 'Claw' stage. The 390-ton, green cabana stands more than 10 stories above the band as they strut through the crowds on moving bridges and a ring-shaped stage with concertgoers inside and out. The U2 touring juggernaut deploys three 'Claws' -- each costing euro100 million ($140 million) and capable of holding up more than 150 tons of lighting, pyrotechnics and giant TV screens -- that are continually being assembled and disassembled in different concert locations. Before taking the stage, Bono joked that the band's performances in Barcelona, Milan, Paris, Nice, Berlin and Amsterdam were just 'rehearsals' for the Dublin concerts. And in front of a crowd waving flags from as far away as Brazil and Japan, Bono said tens of thousands had traveled worldwide to Dublin. 'You know the best place to see U2 live is right here,' he said to cheers. The U2 gigs are delivering an estimated euro50 million ($70 million) boost to Ireland's recession-ravaged economy, with most Dublin hotels booked solid for weeks. Even the Dublin Criminal Court shut down jury deliberations for the weekend because too many jurors had U2 tickets. Nonetheless, Ireland's descent into double-digit unemployment could be seen in the stands. Several thousand seats remained empty -- the first non-sellout of a U2 gig in Dublin since 1980. Irish safety laws also barred fans from the most hallowed end of Croke Park: standing-room-only concrete stands called Hill 16. Hill 16 was built on rubble from Ireland's first, failed rebellion against British rule in 1916. Ireland won independence six years later, but not before British security forces made Hill 16 the most infamous killing ground of the conflict, shooting to death a dozen spectators and athletes at a Gaelic football match. The day become known as Ireland's first Bloody Sunday, the inspiration for U2's 1983 anti-war anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday.' 'We're undefeatable!' Bono shouted. 'Hill 16 right behind us. Out of the rubble of a revolution in 1916 they built a beautiful stadium, and more importantly they built a great country. And there is nothing we can't do if we believe in ourselves.' High school students Paul 'Bono' Hewson, guitarist Dave 'The Edge' Evans, drummer Larry Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton came together to form U2 in Dublin 33 years ago. ------ On the Net: U2, http://www.u2.com "
1,"Maggie Austin Signature Cookies Makes 20 to 25 cookies Creamy peppermint marbled fondant enrobes a crisp and tender sugar cookie. Your family's monogram is the canvas, and each chef participant signs the work of art. The cookie is perfect for a holiday gift or for simply enjoying the gift of time spent together. The sugar cookie dough is easy to roll thin and bakes to a consistency that is midway between chewy and crisp. Custom cake decorator Maggie Austin recommends using Satin Ice fondant, which we ordered online at SatinFineFoods.com. It is not too sweet and it's easy to work with; the smallest amount you can order is a 2-pound tub, but stored properly, it can last for one year. It can also be ordered online at GlobalSugarArt.com ($7.79) or Amazon.com ($11.95). It's best to use a silicone roller or smooth bottle for rolling the fondant, as it can pick up a pattern from a wooden rolling pin. For this recipe, you also will need food-safe colored markers, which we found at Sur La Table. We found the letter cookie cutters at Sur La Table as well. MAKE AHEAD: You may store excess fondant, but it is imperative that the fondant be well wrapped in plastic and stored in a resealable plastic food storage bag to keep it from drying out. The cookie dough needs to be refrigerated for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Decorated cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Undecorated cookies may be frozen for up to 1 month. From Maggie Austin, of Maggie Austin Cake (MaggieAustinCake.com). Ingredients For the cookies 3 cups sifted flour, plus flour for dusting the work surface Pinch salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon good-quality vanilla extract About 3 ounces white fondant, preferably Satin Ice brand (see headnote) Cornstarch, for dusting the work surface A few drops peppermint oil extract Red gel food color (do not use liquid food coloring) Water Food-safe markers (see headnote) Colored sugars, for sprinkling (optional) Steps Whisk or sift together the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or hand-held electric mixer; beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to low; add the egg and vanilla extract, beating until incorporated. Add the flour mixture in three additions, mixing on low speed just until the dough comes together. Do not overmix. Lightly flour a work surface. Transfer the dough to the surface and divide in half, patting both portions into wide, flat disks. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. When ready to bake, let the dough sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with silicone liners or parchment paper. Roll out the dough on the floured work surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Use cookie cutters to cut desired shapes, and arrange the cookies on the baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Scraps can be re-rolled; if the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it for a few minutes before using further. Bake 1 sheet at a time for 7 to 9 minutes, until the edges begin to turn golden; do not let the cookies brown. Let them sit on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat to use all of the dough. Dust the work surface very lightly with cornstarch to prevent sticking. Working with a small amount at a time, knead white fondant with your hands to make it pliable and smooth. Add a drop or two of the peppermint oil extract; taste and adjust as needed. Use a clean toothpick to introduce a few streaks of red gel food color into the fondant. Knead just a few times to achieve a marbled effect. Roll out the fondant until it is quite thin (about 1/16 inch), being careful not to tear it. Cut the fondant using a cutter of the same shape that was used to cut out the cookies. Moisten the back of the fondant shape with a couple drops of water. Use a fingertip or pastry brush dampened with water to help stick a fondant cutout to each baked, cooled cookie. Allow to dry, uncovered, for at least an hour. When the fondant surfaces are firm and dry, use food-safe markers to add signatures and decorations as desired. For a decorative edge, if desired, moisten the edge of the cookie with a couple drops of water. Sprinkle with colored sugar.

1,"It's bad enough for a politician or a party when a campaign contributor is accused of being a major league swindler. But what if the contributor's victims also want their money back? Several Democratic and Republican campaign committees in Washington have been hit with a highly unusual federal lawsuit demanding the return of $1.6 million in political contributions, which are linked to Allen Stanford and his firm, the Stanford Financial Group. Ralph Janvey, a Dallas lawyer appointed as the receiver of Stanford's estate, argues that the money, donated by Stanford or his associates, rightfully belongs to investors whom the financier is suspected of defrauding. The political committees 'have no legitimate right to retain the funds, and the Receiver is entitled to the return of the funds for the benefit of the claimants injured by the fraud,' Janvey's office said in a statement this week. Stanford and his chief financial officer, James Davis, each face criminal fraud charges in connection with an elaborate $7 billion Ponzi scheme. The collapse of Stanford's Houston-based financial empire set off a scramble by individual politicians _ including President Obama and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. _ to give Stanford-linked donations to charity. But the major party committees have ignored Janvey's demands for repayment, according to the lawsuit. The largest recipient of Stanford-connected funds was the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, with $950,500, followed by the National Republican Congressional Committee ($238,500), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($200,000), the Republican National Committee ($128,500) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee ($83,345). The lawsuit argues that since campaign contributions are essentially gifts _ and were not given in return for goods and services _ there is nothing barring the parties from returning the money. And here's the rub for the political committees: If they tried to argue otherwise, they would effectively be admitting to an illegal quid pro quo, legal experts said. The lawsuit is certain to be monitored closely in campaign finance and bankruptcy law circles, not least because a handful of other prominent donors are in the middle of criminal fraud cases. Trevor Potter, president and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, said Janvey's legal argument in the case 'is unprecedented, but that doesn't mean it will be unsuccessful.' "
1,"Lions props Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones are out of the final test against South Africa after undergoing surgery, and the team could also be without backs Brian O'Driscoll, Jamie Roberts, Tommy Bowe and Ronan O'Gara. All six players were injured during Saturday's bruising 28-25 loss to the Springboks at Loftus Versfeld, a defeat which gave the world champions an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series. Jenkins and Jones went off within minutes of each other early in the second half and their loss meant the rest of the game continued with uncontested scrums because the Lions only had one prop, Andrew Sheridan, as a replacement. The Lions said Jenkins had surgery late Saturday to fit a plastic plate into a cracked cheekbone and Jones needed an operation on his dislocated shoulder. Jenkins' injury happened after an accidental clash of heads with South Africa winger Bryan Habana, but Springbok lock Bakkies Botha was scheduled to face a disciplinary hearing on Sunday, accused of dangerously charging into Jones. The Lions had already called up props Ian Payne and John Hayes and both are likely to come into the 22-man team for next Saturday's game at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. O'Driscoll went off with concussion, Roberts has a wrist injury, Bowe an elbow problem and O'Gara a deep cut near his left eye. The Lions said their conditions would be monitored during the week. Lions head coach Ian McGeechan said his team had the character to bounce back and win the third test despite the injury setbacks and the disappointment of losing Saturday's game to Morne Steyn's last-minute, 53-meter penalty. 'There's a lot of character in this group,' McGeechan told BBC Radio on Sunday. 'People asked me the same question last week and I think they got their answer. It will be the same again. 'They're an incredible group of young men. Whatever happens with injuries, we'll be ready to win the third test.' "
1,"A closely divided federal appeals court in San Francisco has dismissed a lawsuit seeking damages from a private company that worked with the CIA as part of its 'extraordinary rendition' program. The court ruled Wednesday that the government's decision to invoke the 'state secrets' privilege means that the case cannot go forward. Five foreign plaintiffs who were allegedly transported by the CIA to countries such as Egypt and Morocco for interrogation had sued Jeppesen Dataplan, a Boeing subsidiary, which provided flight planning and logistical support services. The five men said that they were tortured by foreign intelligence services working with the CIA and that Jeppesen was a critical player in the agency's rendition program. After the suit was filed in 2007, the Bush administration invoked the state secrets privilege. Then-CIA Director Michael Hayden told a U.S. District Court in a declaration that 'the information covered by this privilege assertion reasonably could be expected to cause serious - and in some instances exceptionally grave - damage to the national security of the United States and, therefore, the information should be excluded from any use in this case.' Attorney General Eric Holder reviewed and endorsed the Bush administration's decision to seek the lawsuit's dismissal on the grounds that the suit would divulge state secrets. A U.S. District court judge first dismissed the lawsuit. That decision was overturned by a unanimous panel of three appellate judges, who said the privilege could be applied only to selective pieces of evidence and not the entire case. On Wednesday, a full panel of 11 judges on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit split 6 to 5 in favor of dismissing the lawsuit. 'This case requires us to address the difficult balance the state secrets doctrine strikes between fundamental principles of our liberty, including justice, transparency, accountability and national security,' wrote Judge Raymond Fisher, adding that the court must 'reluctantly conclude' that the claim of privilege cannot be overcome 'if the court is ultimately satisfied that (state) secrets are at stake.' The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court but acknowledged in a statement that the ruling 'all but shuts the door on accountability.' 'This is a sad day not only for the torture victims whose attempt to seek justice has been extinguished, but for all Americans who care about the rule of law and our nation's reputation in the world,' said Ben Wizner, staff attorney with the ACLU, who argued the case before the 9th Circuit. In recent years, the government has invoked the state secrets privilege in a number of cases, including various suits concerning the National Security Agency's wiretapping program. A spokesman for the Justice Department said the government would have no comment on the ruling. Previously, the department has said that it will invoke the state secrets privilege 'only in legally appropriate situations' and that the Justice Department 'will ensure the privilege is not invoked to hide from the American people information about their government's actions that they have a right to know.'

1,"SINGAPORE - Fears that quantitative easing by the United States will lead to a surge in capital flows to emerging markets have been overblown, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said Wednesday. 'Some of the concerns have been overstated,' Zoellick said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Singapore. 'Even if you didn't have quantitative easing, as long as you have differential growth rates you're going to see capital flow to these emerging markets.' The Federal Reserve last week announced plans to buy $600 billion of long-term government bonds in its second effort at so-called quantitative easing, or QE2, aiming to stoke U.S. economic growth. Policy makers from Asia to South America responded by warning it could depress the dollar and spark capital flight to emerging markets. While the Fed's move has 'made the debate tenser,' it's unlikely to create a flood of additional funds internationally, Zoellick said. These tensions can lead to 'a downward spiral of protectionism,' he said. 'Part of the problem in the system is because the Chinese currency is pegged, it's hard for others to adjust if China doesn't adjust,' Zoellick said. 'In the broader issue of exchange rates, you're moving to what I call a Bretton Woods III system, where you have key roles for the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound, and over time, the renminbi,' he said. The Chinese currency 'has to internationalize and then become an open capital account.' Zoellick said in a column in the Financial Times earlier this week that Group of 20 nations should consider using gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future currency values as they reform the global monetary system. 'Gold is the yellow elephant in the room,' Zoellick said Wednesday. 'Markets are already using gold as an alternative monetary asset because confidence is low. Policy makers need to consider this as an indicator about how markets are viewing their policies.' Zoellick said his call for the use of gold as a reference point is not one that advocates a return to the gold standard. After his Financial Times column, Reuters said Zoellick was suggesting the adoption of a 'modified gold standard' while Agence France-Presse described it as a call on G-20 nations to bring gold back 'as an anchor to guide currency movements.' 'I don't believe you can return to a fixed exchange rate system and therefore I don't believe you can return to the gold standard,' Zoellick told reporters in Singapore today. 'There's uncertainty about the future of the international monetary system. That's not saying there should be a gold standard. It is saying that we have a problem that needs to be fixed.' Over time, countries need to be able to have flexible exchange rates, the former U.S. deputy secretary of state and chief trade representative said in the interview. 'You need to be able to try to avoid interventions except for extreme circumstances,' he said. Some of the emerging markets may have some hot capital- flow issues to deal with, and global finance chiefs and central bankers need to agree to some 'sort of norms of what are the appropriate roles, and then have the International Monetary Fund partly be the referee that observes those norms and as necessary blows the whistle,' he said. The global recovery has been 'rather slow and still fraught with uncertainties,' Zoellick said. Asia needs to spur private investment in infrastructure and increase the efficiency of government spending on such projects to support growth, he said in a speech in Singapore today. --With assistance from Anand Menon in Singapore.

1,"The Federal Reserve will get authority to limit interchange, or 'swipe' fees, that merchants pay for each debit-card transaction. The measure, pushed by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., lets retailers refuse credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer discounts based on the form of payment. The measure also directs the Fed to issue rules that let merchants route debit- card transactions on more than one network. That 'provides additional competition to a previously non-competitive part of the market,' Durbin said in a statement June 21. Visa and MasterCard, the world's biggest payments networks, set interchange rates and pass that money to card-issuers including Bank of America and JPMorgan. Interchange is the largest component of the fees merchants pay to accept Visa and MasterCard debit cards. The fees totaled $19.7 billion and averaged 1.63 percent of each sale last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. The industry fought off earlier efforts to regulate interchange fees, including a Durbin-sponsored bill that remains in committee, by saying the income is needed to offset the risk of lending money. That argument doesn't apply to interchange on debit cards, which tap funds in consumer checking accounts. Shifting the focus to debit cards may have helped win support from some Republicans, with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, calling the scaled-down version a 'reasonable approach.' The amendment directs the Fed to ensure that debit-swipe fees are 'reasonable and proportional' to the cost of processing transactions. The provision will take effect a year after enactment. Durbin altered his proposal to exempt lenders with assets of less than $10 billion, or 99 percent of banks. That failed to win the support of trade groups representing community banks and credit unions, who said the measure will make their cards more expensive than those issued by bigger lenders. "
1,"A former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured and imprisoned during Brazil's long dictatorship was elected Sunday as president of Latin America's biggest nation, a country in the midst of an economic and political rise. A statement from the Supreme Electoral Court, which oversees elections, said governing party candidate Dilma Rousseff won the election. When she takes office Jan. 1, she will be Brazil's first female leader. With 99 percent of the ballots counted, Rousseff had 55.6 percent compared to 44.4 percent for her centrist rival, Jose Serra, the electoral court said. 'I'm very happy. I want to thank all Brazilians for this moment and I promise to honor the trust they have shown me,' Rousseff told reporters who swarmed a car carrying her in Brasilia, her first public words as president-elect. Rousseff, the hand-chosen candidate of wildly popular President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, won by cementing her image to Silva's, whose policies she promised to continue. She will lead a nation on the rise, a country that will host the 2014 World Cup and that is expected to be the globe's fifth-largest economy by the time it hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics. It has also recently discovered huge oil reserves off its coast. Rousseff was already speaking like a president-elect before the result was announced. 'Starting tomorrow we begin a new stage of democracy,' Rousseff, 62, said in the southern city of Porto Alegre, where she cast her vote. 'I will rule for everyone, speak with all Brazilians, without exception.' Silva used his 80 percent approval ratings to campaign incessantly for Rousseff, his former chief of staff and political protege. She never has held elected office and lacks the charisma that transformed Silva from a one-time shoeshine boy into one of the globe's most popular leaders. Silva was barred by the constitution from running for a third consecutive four-year term. He has batted down chatter in Brazil's press that he is setting himself up for a new run at the presidency in 2014, which would be legal. Despite Rousseff's win, many voters don't want 'Lula,' as he is popularly known, to go away. 'If Lula ran for president 10 times, I would vote for him 10 times,' said Marisa Santos, a 43-year-old selling her homemade jewelry on a Sao Paulo street. 'I'm voting for Dilma, of course, but the truth is it will still be Lula who will lead us.' Within 20 minutes of Rousseff's victory being announced, her supporters began streaming onto a main avenue in Sao Paulo, where eight years ago a huge gathering celebrated Silva's win, the first time the Workers Party took the presidency. Police blocked off the road and workers were already constructing a stage for a party expected to last the entire night. 'We've been waiting for this dream for so long,' said Sandra Martins, a 40-year-old school teacher who was dressed in Worker Party red and waving a large Rousseff campaign flag. 'It's going to be the third term for Lula -- except this time represented by a woman.' Silva entered office with a background as a leftist labor leader, but he governed from a moderate perspective. Under his leadership, the economy grew strongly and Brazil weathered the global financial crisis better than most nations. He is loved within Brazil by the legions of poor, who consider the nation's first working-class president one of their own. His social programs and orthodox economic policies have helped lift 20 million people out of poverty and thrust another 29 million into the middle class. Serra is a 68-year-old former governor of Sao Paulo state and one-time health minister who was badly beaten by Silva in the 2002 presidential election. 'I voted for Dilma because she is a fighter,' said Estevam Sanches, a 43-year-old pizza parlor owner in Sao Paulo. 'What we need is a fighter in the presidency to continue, as she says she will, with Lula's efforts to eradicate poverty and strengthen the economy.' Rousseff was a key player in an armed militant group that resisted Brazil's military dictatorship -- and was imprisoned and tortured for it. She is a cancer survivor and a former minister of energy and chief of staff to Silva. She possesses a management style that earned her the moniker 'Iron Lady' -- a name she detests. She is the daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant father, a lawyer who died when she was 14, and a Brazilian mother who was a schoolteacher. Her past points to an early political awakening. In 1967, as a 19-year-old economics student, she joined a militant political group opposing the dictatorship. For three years she helped lead guerrilla organizations, instructed comrades on Marxist theory and wrote for an underground newspaper. Rousseff denies carrying out any acts of violence during this period, says she opposed such action and notes she was never accused by the military regime of violent acts. After three years underground, Rousseff was captured in 1970 by Brazil's military police and was considered a big enough catch that a military prosecutor labeled her the 'Joan of Arc' of the guerrilla movement. She was tossed into the Tiradentes prison where she was submitted to brutal torture. After being released, she moved to southern Brazil in 1973, where she reunited with her now ex-husband, Carlos Araujo, who was also an imprisoned militant. She gave birth to a daughter and finished an economics degree. As Brazil's dictatorship began to loosen its grip, Rousseff became more politically involved and campaigned to get her husband elected to the state congress in 1982. After holding appointed positions in city and state governments, Rousseff served for two years as the nation's energy minister after Silva took office in 2003. She became his chief of staff in 2005, a position she held until resigning earlier this year to campaign. Rousseff says her political thinking has evolved drastically -- from Marxism to pragmatic capitalism -- but she remains proud of her radical roots. 'We fought and participated in a dream to build a better Brazil,' she said in an interview published in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo in 2005, one of the rare times she has spoken in detail about her militancy and torture endured. 'We learned a lot. We did a lot of nonsense, but that is not what characterizes us. What characterizes us is to have dared to want a better country.' ------ Associated Press reporters Marco Sibaja in Brasilia, Brazil, and Stan Lehman and Tales Azzoni in Sao Paulo contributed to this story.

1,"The top Senate Democrat says he will force a test vote this week on a measure to give tens of thousands of young illegal immigrants a path to legal status. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada says he will move to schedule action on the so-called Dream Act. It would give more than 100,000 young immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16 chances to become legal residents if they attend college or join the military. It was unclear whether Reid could muster the 60 votes necessary to move to an up-or-down vote on the measure. It has some degree of bipartisan support, but is opposed by most Republicans and some Democrats who regard it as little more than an amnesty grant for illegal immigrants. "
1,"I write this from a hotel room near my home town. We had to escape. Two weeks with both sides of our family has sent us into hiding, and I will not disclose our location. The holiday traditions that sounded so lovely and warm in November are long gone now. A Snow Cat rolled over them somewhere between the eggnog and the yule log. As we packed the car, we vowed that next year we will take this delicious expanse of two weeks with our children and do something extraordinary _ a getaway with just the two kids, when we can be our little family without the pressures of dueling traditions. We agreed on our New Year's resolution. In the rearview mirror, we saw the detritus of my traditional Christmas dinner, killed by the in-laws' preference for a restaurant. The leisurely brunch we wanted to have on New Year's Day at a restaurant was quashed by my parents' second round of sledding and heart-healthy oatmeal. His family drives three blocks to dinner; mine cross-country skis there. In the kitchens, we skirmished over dishwasher-loading techniques, knife sharpening, coffee grinding, the best way to put sweetener in coffee, how long to cook a steak and the stacking of Tupperware. On Christmas, I declared my savior to be the merry margarita, and plenty of Facebook friends agreed. They were exasperated by their families, too. There was the heated argument over health-care reform, the remote-control tug of war between Fox News and CNN, the epic argument over when to use the four-wheel drive and, of course, a debate about whether vampires are cooler than werewolves. When my husband's family planned its annual dive into the frightening waters of the shopping mall in December, I shuddered in fear and went to work instead. When my family clicked into our skis for a nighttime schuss at 8,200 feet on New Year's Eve, my husband declared us all insane and retreated to the ski lodge. And to think that I always wondered why anyone would want to vacation away from extended family over the winter break. Mai tais instead of mulled wine? Grand Bahama instead of grandma? But a recent Travelocity poll found that 58 percent of people polled said they would rather go on a real vacation than an obliged, out-of-town visit to family. That kind of getaway is known as an oblication, which is barely one step above a staycation. Or maybe I mean one step down. The past two weeks involved two cross-country flights, 379 timeouts, three crying jags and several declarations of divorce (by several women). I began to think that 58 percent of people in the Travelocity survey are very, very smart. We left my family a day early (before my father discovered we had broken the shower head in his bathroom), found a hotel near the airport and exhaled. I immediately went online to start looking for next year's destination. Later, we had dinner with an old friend of ours, a single mom of a 3-year-old who has lost both of her parents. She joined us for Christmas a couple of years ago, and we still worry that she was overwhelmed by the chaos of it all. 'You know, I was just so lonely this year. I was kind of waiting for an invitation all week,' she told us. 'I just don't have that pull to go anywhere, and sometimes I wish for that.' Last year, my husband and I resolved to spend the holidays away from the family. Of course, we forgot about that pact once autumn came, and we felt that pull. It's probably what will happen again. I think that for December 2010, we'll do one thing differently: extend that invitation to our friend and allow the electricity that three children can generate to light up the holiday. Christmas and chaos, one and the same. E-mail me with your post-holiday woes at dvorakp@washpost.com. "
1,"There is a compulsion, a yearning, a force that causes people to drive to this remote village, up the rocky coastline and through the hilly streets. They park near the olde shoppes and the gingerbread Victorians, walk to the cream house with purple trim, and then, as if fulfilling a destiny that has shaped every moment of their lives, they raise their shirts, they shake their belly fat, and they do the Truffle Shuffle. 'Oh, sure,' says Regina Willkie, of Astoria's Chamber of Commerce. 'They all want to make sure they go to Mikey's house, do the Shuffle. It's just something that clicks with people.' This is devotion in its purest form, built on a 114-minute movie filmed here and released in June 1985. Since, there's been almost nothing to fan the flames of fandom _ no resuscitated spinoffs, a la 'Star Wars' or 'Star Trek.' Years ago there was a board game and a Nintendo game. There are always talks of a sequel that will never materialize. Still the fans come, this anniversary weekend especially, to celebrate their love of 'The Goonies.' 'The Goonies' turns 25 on Monday. Goonies never say die. 'The Goonies' are ... how to explain them if you were not born in the '70s or '8os, the sweet spot of obsession? They were a club of seven misfits, including a fat kid (Chunk _ forced to perform the indignity of the Truffle Shuffle on command), a loudmouth and a gadget whiz. They all went on a treasure hunt below the earth to find a missing pirate ship and to escape the Fratelli brothers _ cons who kept their mutant sibling, Sloth, locked in the basement, when all he wanted was a Baby Ruth. A few years ago, when Willkie realized that people were coming from as far away as Japan to see the sites of the movie, she planned a 25th anniversary celebration. During this four-day extravaganza, the town's usual population of 10,000 has swelled. All of the hotel rooms are full. All of the bus tours are sold out. The autograph lines for the cast meet 'n' greets are five hours long. Hundreds of fans trip blissfully from costume contests to quiz nights. It's like a stoner- free 'Big Lebowski' fest. They greet each other on the street with 'Hey, you Guu-uuuys!' _ the official greeting of the Goonies. Anyone who understands the meaning of the Goonies _ friendship, adventure, awesomeness _ is, by definition, also a Goonie. 'She's totally a Goonie,' Michael Morris says of his wife, Carolina. How does he know? 'All the other girls are like, `I want a big wedding,' but she suggested we come here.' They traveled from New Orleans to be married Friday night on the Goonies beach. That is a Goonie move. Brothers Jesse and Jeremy Horst drove across the country from Buffalo, N.Y., in homemade Chunk and Sloth costumes. That is a Goonie move. At one point or another, all fans end up at the house inhabited by Mikey, played by a pre-'Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin. The owner of this house made the biggest Goonie move of all. Sandi Preston did a Goonies pilgrimage in the 1990s. She visited the house and fell in love. 'I asked God if he would give me the Goonie house,' Preston recalls, 'and He did.' Four years after she first began praying for it, someone put the house up for sale. Preston moved from California to Astoria. She is happy to give tours; just leave your shoes on the porch. Here is the doorway that Data crashes though. Here is the living room where Chunk breaks the statue. Here is the door to the attic _ tourists love the attic. What is it that draws people? 'Well,' she says, 'have you SEEN the movie?' Let us see the movie, for the 10th or 15th time. Let us go to one of the nightly screenings held at the Columbian Voodoo, a battered single-screen theater with wobbly vinyl seats. Let the lights dim and the credits begin, reminding you how many icons started as Goonies. There is a pre-puberty Corey Feldman as Mouth, telling the Spanish- speaking housekeeper that she will be locked up with the cockroaches. There is young Josh Brolin (in his first movie role) as big brother Brandon, and Astin's Mikey, the sentimental asthmatic and the ostensible soul of the movie. There is Jeff Cohen as Chunk, the real<I> </I> soul of the movie, befriending Sloth, Truffle-Shuffling his heart out. Don't lovable schlubs Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill owe debts to the Chunkness of Chunk? Nestled into our vinyl at the Voodoo, it's 1985 all over again but it's also 2010. The pirate treasure is being hunted only because the Goonies are in danger of losing their homes to big business, watching the American dream wither before their preteen eyes. Their families could be the families of today's recession, except that the Walshes' plan if they lose their home, says Mikey, is to move to Detroit. Not such a good idea, Mikey, not anymore. After the movie, we call Willis Van Dusen, Astoria's mayor of 19 years, catching him just as he finishes judging a costume contest. Mr. Mayor, 'The Goonies' is about kids saving a fictional Astoria. How would you say the movie has impacted the real one? 'I'm not sure that's the right phrasing,' the mayor says. He has lived here his whole life; his business cards read 'N.B.A.,' for Native Born Astorian. He was an extra in the movie. 'The Goonies didn't impact our culture,' he says. 'The Goonies are part of our culture. They're part of our history. As we go, so go the Goonies.' Jeff Cohen, 35, will tell you about the last time he did the Truffle Shuffle. He was leading cheers at a Berkeley football game, where he was a student in the 1990s, and in the back of the stadium, a drunk guy started chanting 'Truffle Shuffle!' until it seemed like the whole stadium joined in. He thought if he didn't comply, 'they might murder me.' That's what it took _ the threat of death by a mob. He Shuffled at Berkeley. He has not Shuffled since, or acted much. The fans still ask. Here at a cast meet-and-greet, the fans are swarming Cohen, Feldman and Joe Pantoliano, who played a Fratelli brother (Astin is set to arrive the next day). They ask Cohen to sign their Chunk action figures, their Chunk T-shirts. They bare stomachs and ask him to sign their Chunk bellies. 'All my favorite quotes are yours,' says one girl who is looking at him in a way that makes you think she wants to become Mrs. Chunk. Chunk has lost his jiggle and his goofy curls; he now has a sleek physique and a shaved head. He looks like Chunk only in the teeth, which are still slightly crooked, but adorably. When, post-puberty, acting offers started drying up, Cohen headed to college (winning a student government seat on a 'Chunk for President' campaign) and then to law school. He now owns an entertainment law firm in Los Angeles. His clients know who he is, but since 'in any room that I'm in now, I'm the 15th most famous person,' no one really cares. He doesn't need to be here for financial or fame reasons, but 'I think it's nice. It's nice to make something people like, that people are attached to.' The cast will be perpetually haunted by 'Goonies.' 'We get `Hey you guuu-uuys!' at every concert,' says Feldman, who now fronts a band that will perform in Astoria. 'Every single concert.' (Goonies trivia: Feldman met his 1980s counterpart Corey Haim at the Goonies audition where both were up for Mouth. R.I.P. Corey Haim. Could the brotherhood of the Goonies have saved you?) Some would argue that 'The Goonies' had no meaning, that it was nothing but a string of oddly memorable catchphrases: 'Rocky Road?' 'It's wet, ain't it?' 'Always separate the drugs.' 'Follow them size fives.' At one point in the movie, the Goonies have a chance for rescue, when they realize they are below the town wishing well and that popular jerk Troy, standing above, could pull them up. Mikey persuades everyone to stay. He wants to finish the adventure, not capitulate to the adults outside and the Troys of the world. 'That's the line I quote the most,' says Brandon Lerner, a fan from Seattle. ' `It's all over the second we ride up Troy's bucket.' ' That's the thing. True Goonies know that when Mikey refused the bucket, when he said, 'It's OUR time down here,' he wasn't talking about the bottom of the cave. He was talking about wanting to stay in childhood just a little longer, because it can never be retrieved. And when adults make the pilgrimage to Astoria, they're not coming for the Truffle Shuffle. They're coming to show that Mikey was wrong, that sometimes it can. "
1,"How do you recover from the death of a child? The movie 'Rabbit Hole' eloquently posits the only correct answer to that question: You don't. Based on David Lindsay-Abaire's acclaimed 2006 play of the same name, 'Rabbit Hole' focuses on a grieving couple eight months after their young son was killed by a car while chasing his dog into the street. What on the surface seems to possess all the melodrama and photogenic suffering of a banal prime-time weepie instead becomes a lucid, tough, deeply sensitive examination of emotional fortitude. It's important for viewers to know that it's okay to laugh during 'Rabbit Hole.' Thanks to Lindsay-Abaire's mastery of difficult tonal shifts and John Cameron Mitchell's alert, nimble direction, laughs and tears co-exist, if not comfortably, at least recognizably as equally necessary to surviving life's most devastating moments. In Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart, Mitchell has found actors who gracefully pull off that psychological high-wire act as Becca and Howie, an attractive, prosperous couple who have reached the point in their mourning where most of their friends and neighbors think it's time to be moving on. Howie tries to do this by attending support-group meetings and contemplating another child. Becca cooks compulsively, repels the efforts of friends to get together and goes about daily life with crisp matter-of-factness, even when it comes to removing their son's drawings from the refrigerator. Becca reserves her cruelest barbs for her mother, Nat (Dianne Wiest), who lost a grown son to drug addiction but whose attempts at empathy Becca resents as unearned comparisons. (Sandra Oh and Tammy Blanchard, as a support group member and Becca's sister, respectively, provide welcome comic relief for the film's most discomfiting encounters.) Becca eventually discovers solace in the most surprising place imaginable, but 'Rabbit Hole' resists facile catharsis or easy equivalencies. Thanks in large part to Kidman's refusal to soften her character's most fascinating sharp edges, as well as Mitchell's superb command of the material, 'Rabbit Hole' gives the lie to such comforting fictions as closure and transcendence. As Wiest suggests in her character's moving soliloquy, sometimes the best thing to do with feelings isn't to 'process' or 'work through' them, but simply to feel them. 'Hanging in there' can often seem like a meaningless cliche, but in 'Rabbit Hole' the phrase takes on newfound meaning as perhaps the hardest, most heroic thing in the world to do. PG-13. Contains mature thematic material, drug use and profanity. 92 minutes. "
1,"The last of 15 American men left in the U.S. Open on Tuesday when 20th-seeded Sam Querrey lost in the fourth round to No. 25 Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 7-6 (9), 6-7 (5), 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 after nearly 4 1/2 hours of wind-affected play. Querrey's exit means no U.S. men reached the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows for the second consecutive year -- something that never had happened before 2009 in the history of a tournament that began in 1881. 'I didn't feel any extra pressure or anything. I definitely wanted to win and keep the American men (in) -- keep the hope going,' said Querrey, who was broken in the match's last game. 'You know, I was close.' His exit also ensures there will be a record-low one appearance by an American man in the quarterfinals at any of tennis' four Grand Slam tournaments this season (Andy Roddick lost in that round at the Australian Open). Since 1925, when the French championships first allowed foreign competitors, the United States managed to place at least two representatives in Grand Slam quarterfinals every year. 'I mean, it's annoying that the Europeans are in the quarters every Slam,' Querrey said. 'We're trying.' There have been other negative signs recently for a nation that produced greats of the game through the generations such as Bill Tilden, Don Budge, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. U.S. men are in their longest Grand Slam title drought in tennis' 42-year Open era: No man from the country has won a major championship since Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open, now a 28-tournament gap. The only longer span between U.S. Grand Slam titles was a 30-tournament shutout from 1955-63. Plus, there's this: Only two active U.S. men, Roddick and Robby Ginepri, even have reached the semifinals at a major tournament. When Roddick dropped to 11th last month, it marked the first time in the 37-year history of the rankings that the United States didn't have a member of the top 10. The U.S. Davis Cup team lost in the first round to Serbia in March, its earliest exit since 2005; if the Americans fail to beat Colombia later this month, they will fall out of the competition's World Group for the first time since 1988 and need to earn their way back into the top tier. 'The game's a lot different than it was in the '90s, when there were 15 countries playing. Now, every country is a contender,' Bob Bryan said after teaming with twin brother Mike to win Tuesday and give the U.S. a team in the men's doubles semifinals at Flushing Meadows. 'So, yeah, it's just a lot deeper. A lot of countries like Serbia rising to the top of the game and bumping America down.' With Querrey gone, Venus Williams is the only U.S. singles player still standing. She got to the semifinals by beating Francesca Schiavone of Italy 7-6 (5), 6-4 on Tuesday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. That women's match didn't begin until after 6 p.m. because it followed Querrey vs. Wawrinka. Both Querrey and Wawrinka -- who upset 2008 U.S. Open runner-up Andy Murray in the third round this year -- were striving to earn a debut trip to a Grand Slam quarterfinal. And by joining his far-more-accomplished countryman, Roger Federer, in the round of eight, Wawrinka helped give Switzerland two quarterfinalists at a major for the first time. 'Roger, he's always in quarterfinals, (for) many years, so that's not something different,' said Wawrinka, a 25-year-old who is participating in his 23rd Grand Slam tournament. 'But for me, it's my first time, so it's something important for my career.' Wawrinka teamed up this summer with a new coach, Peter Lundgren, who was working with Federer when he won his first major title at Wimbledon in 2004. Lundgren has pushed Wawrinka to add variety to his game, and that helped against Querrey. Also key: Querrey's right leg began to cramp as the match dragged on. 'The last four games, he was really tired, and was really difficult for him to stay with his game,' said Wawrinka, who next faces No. 12 Mikhail Youzhny of Russia. 'He (changed) his game because he was tired.' Querrey certainly had his chances. 'He'll definitely have a feeling that this is a match he could have won,' said Querrey's coach, David Nainkin. 'He'll be disappointed that it got away from him.' In the first set, Querrey hit more aces and total winners than Wawrinka and held the only three break points of the set, at love-40 in the third game, but wasted them. Querrey also led 3-0 in that tiebreaker, then had a set point at 8-7 but couldn't convert. In the third set, Querrey went up a break and led 3-1, but got broken back to 3-all, then lost serve again in the last game, when he missed two volleys badly. 'Those are kind of the two shots I can look back, and that I remember, and I'm a little bummed about,' said the 22-year-old Querrey, who grew up in California and now calls Las Vegas home. 'The first one was kind of tough. The wind kind of got it behind my head a little bit. The other one was inexcusable.' Querrey lost in the fourth round for the second major tournament in a row, after also bowing out at Wimbledon in that round. 'Hopefully I can keep that up in the Slams,' he said. 'I think I can win that round-of-16 match, and keep winning matches after that.' Like the other U.S. men, he will have to wait till next year to find out. "
1,"ING Groep NV, the Dutch bank and insurer, said Friday it will repay euro5.56 billion ($7.4 billion) in government bailout money on Dec. 21 with cash raised from investors. That's half of the euro10 billion, plus interest, that ING received from the Netherlands in one bailout package last year. The company is paying the state back with proceeds from a euro7.5 billion share issue. 'After repaying half of the funds we received last year from the Dutch state, we will work now toward repaying the second half,' said CEO Jan Hommen. He said the company would use regular earnings and money raised from divestments for that. Until it repays the aid in full, ING is barred from buying other firms and from undercutting rivals with lower prices or more favorable interest rates, and it must get EU approval to repay hybrid and subordinated debt capital. ING is using another euro1.3 billion of the money raised in the share issue to pay for its other bailout package, a complicated transaction by which the Dutch assumed most of the risks and benefits of ING's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. European Union competition authorities said the state had overpaid in that deal, amounting to unfair support for ING. ING has also agreed to sell its insurance operations, which are roughly half its business, under pressure from the EU ---------- On the Net: http://www.ing.com "
1,"WASHINGTON - Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest defense company, posted a 28 percent decline in third- quarter profit and scaled back its 2010 earnings forecast Tuesday because of retirement-plan costs and the sale of a unit. Net income fell to $571 million, or $1.57 a share, from $797 million, or $2.07, a year earlier, the Bethesda, Md.- based company said Tuesday in a statement. Profit from continuing operations of $1.55 a share beat the $1.53 average estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Full-year profit from continuing operations may be $6.75 to $6.95 a share, a reduction of 40 cents at both ends of the range from a July forecast, Lockheed said. The company cited costs from the sale of its Enterprise Integration Group business and expenses related to its voluntary retirement plan. The average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was $7.11. Chief Executive Officer Robert Stevens has faced more Pentagon scrutiny on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the most expensive U.S. weapon system, after the plane fell behind schedule and costs rose. He is unloading EIG and another unit and unveiled the retirement program for senior executives to cut expenses and improve profit margins. Sales rose 5.6 percent to $11.4 billion during the quarter. Lockheed forecast 2011 sales growth in the 'low single digit range' because of delays in program starts and cancellations. Lockheed's sales have grown 84 percent to $45.2 billion in 2009 from $24.5 billion in 2000, boosted by U.S. defense spending and war-related costs. 'The two most visible delays this year are the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship and the THAAD' or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, Bruce Tanner, Lockheed's chief financial officer, said in a phone interview. 'That has the effect of pushing out sales for half the year and causing a slower buildup in 2011,' he said. The Navy had planned to pick a winner for the 55-vessel Littoral Combat Ship program in the summer and it has now been delayed to November, Tanner said. A team led by Lockheed is competing against a group including General Dynamics Corp. for the first stage of the program estimated to be about $6 billion. Lockheed's reduced profit forecast for 2010 compares with $7.78 in 2009. Profit for 2011 will be little changed compared with 2010 'because while there's some growth it's lower than what we expected,' Tanner said. The profit margin on the F-35 program also is lower than the company expected, he said. The profit 'guidance signals potential pricing pressures' in the defense industry as more projects move toward fixed-priced contracts, Joel Levington, a bond analyst at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e- mail. 'The lack of growth may spur more aggressive capital allocation decisions in the industry, with a step-up in share repurchases and acquisitions.' The company agreed on Oct. 13 to sell its EIG unit to New York-based Veritas Capital for $815 million, following a June decision to divest the division to avoid conflicts of interest. The planned sale of the Pacific Architects & Engineers unit is likely to be done by year's end, Lockheed said in the statement. The company said in September that more than 600 executives, or 25 percent of the total, took a voluntary retirement program designed to cut costs to match the growth of defense spending, which is projected to increase no more than the pace of inflation. That program will result in a one- time charge of $178 million, Lockheed said in the statement. "
1,"A dance troupe from Florida caused a rush-hour terror scare when they ditched their cars in the Lincoln Tunnel and tried to run to a TV appearance in New York City while wearing their camouflage costumes. The dancers drove about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) so they could appear Wednesday on BET's live '106 & Park' show. But they hit traffic at the tunnel, which connects New Jersey and New York City and is just two miles from the TV studio in Manhattan. The five young women and three young men decided to sprint the rest of the way. They left their adult chaperones behind and ran through the toll plaza. Armed officers with Port Authority police and the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force gave chase, closing the tunnel for 45 minutes. They eventually offered to escort the dancers to the show, but the producers told them it was too late. The troupe headed back to Jacksonville, Florida. ------ Information from: The Jersey Journal, http://www.nj.com/jjournal Information from: New York Post, http://www.nypost.com "
1,"NEW YORK - Winnebago Industries Inc., the nation's biggest maker of motor homes, may make its first acquisition in more than 20 years, signaling the recreational-vehicle market sees a sustained economic recovery. Winnebago said it may acquire SunnyBrook Manufacturing Inc., the privately held maker of towable recreational-vehicles, by the end of the year. Winnebago, which didn't disclose financial details, said Monday it has signed a letter of intent and is still studying the potential deal. A takeover by Forest City, Iowa-based Winnebago would mark an entry into the faster-growing towable RV market, Craig Kennison, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, wrote in a research note. The acquisition also reflects confidence among RV makers, which have foreshadowed economic declines and rebounds. 'There won't be a double dip in the RV industry,' Mac Bryan, vice president of administration at the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, said in a telephone interview. 'This is a marketplace that is in recovery.' The acquisition would be Winnebago's first in more than 20 years, Sheila Davis, a spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. Davis said the company, which announced in November 2009 that it was studying 'potential diversification strategies,' may consider additional acquisitions. Winnebago leads the motor home industry with a 19 percent market share, according to Robert W. Baird's Kennison, who is based in Milwaukee. SunnyBrook sold 1,700 towable RVs last year, making it the thirteenth-largest manufacturer in that market, Kennison wrote yesterday in a research note. 'We like the concept,' he wrote. 'Winnebago has the most recognizable brand in RVs, but has yet to leverage it in the faster-growing towable market. SunnyBrook would represent a small but strategic step in that direction.' Kennison estimates Middlebury, Ind.-based SunnyBrook's annual revenue at $30 million to $40 million. Wholesale deliveries by RV manufacturers surged 71 percent to 177,300 units through the first eight months of 2010, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. Shipments in all of 2009 were 165,700, the lowest since 1991, according to RVIA data, as consumers deferred discretionary purchases during the economic slump. Shipments may rise to 239,900 in 2010, a gain of 45 percent from 2009, according to Richard Curtin, an RV industry analyst and director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. Industry shipments may increase 8 percent to 259,600 in 2011, according to Curtin, who analyzes data for the RVIA, the industry's Reston, Va.-based trade group. The RV industry includes more than 80 manufacturers, RVIA's Bryan said. 'This is the time in the business cycle where consolidation tends to occur,' Bryan said. 'While we're still seeing some problems continuing related to consumer confidence and the availability of credit, we're finding that primary demand is very strong. Consumers want to be in RVs and in the outdoors.' "
1,"A thick, 22-mile (35.4-kilometer) plume of oil discovered by researchers off the BP spill site was nearing an underwater canyon, where it could poison the foodchain for sealife in the waters off Florida. The discovery by researchers on the University of South Florida College of Marine Science's Weatherbird II vessel is the second significant undersea plume reported since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20. The find was announced Thursday. The cloud was nearing a large underwater canyon whose currents fuel the foodchain in Gulf waters off Florida and could potentially wash the tiny plants and animals that feed larger organisms in a stew of toxic chemicals, another researcher said. Larry McKinney, executive director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, said the DeSoto Canyon off the Florida Panhandle sends nutrient-rich water from the deep sea up to shallower waters. McKinney said that in a best-case scenario, oil riding the current out of the canyon would rise close enough to the surface to be broken down by sunlight. But if the plume remains relatively intact, it could sweep down the west coast of Florida as a toxic soup as far as the Keys. The thick plume was detected just beneath the surface down to about 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) and is more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide, said David Hollander, associate professor of chemical oceanography at USF. Hollander said the team detected the thickest amount of hydrocarbons, likely from the oil spewing from the blown out well, at about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in the same spot on two separate days this week. The discovery was important, he said, because it confirmed that the substance found in the water was not naturally occurring and that the plume was at its highest concentration in deeper waters. The researchers will use further testing to determine whether the hydrocarbons they found are the result of dispersants or the emulsification of oil as it traveled away from the well. The first such plume detected by scientists stretched from the well southwest toward the open sea, but this new undersea oil cloud is headed miles (kilometers) inland into shallower waters where many fish and other species reproduce. The researchers say they are worried these undersea plumes may be the result of the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants to break up the oil a mile undersea at the site of the leak. Hollander said the oil they detected has dissolved into the water, and is no longer visible, leading to fears from researchers that the toxicity from the oil and dispersants could pose a big danger to fish larvae and creatures that filter the waters for food. 'There are two elements to it,' Hollander said. 'The plume reaching waters on the continental shelf could have a toxic effect on fish larvae, and we also may see a long term response as it cascades up the food web.' Dispersants contain surfactants, which are similar to dishwashing soap. A Louisiana State University researcher who has studied their effects on marine life said that by breaking oil into small particles, surfactants make it easier for fish and other animals to soak up the oil's toxic chemicals. That can impair the animals' immune systems and cause reproductive problems. 'The oil's not at the surface, so it doesn't look so bad, but you have a situation where it's more available to fish,' said Kevin Kleinow, a professor in LSU's school of veterinary medicine. "
1,"The workers are rising in the workers' republic. In China's south coastal provinces, which long ago supplanted the American Midwest as the world's premier manufacturing belt, employees have gone on strike at a series of factories. Nobody knows how many plants have been threatened with shutdowns or have ground to a halt; one American attorney who's spent a good deal of time with such workers estimates that it may be close to 1,000. The cause of the unrest is no mystery. China's rise to industrial preeminence (in a quantitative if not qualitative sense) has come on the backs of workers whose wages the government has, until recently, suppressed to keep the price of exports artificially low. The official Communist Party-dominated All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is not really a union. Workers do not choose its leaders, who most frequently come from management. 'The union,' says the attorney, 'is less state-dominated than employer-dominated.' That is a logical consequence of two party priorities: to build an industrial sector that dominates global markets through low prices; and to prohibit the existence of any organizations that could eventually challenge party control. While the latter priority is an iron rule, the former is merely situational. Now that China's industrial might is established, and many of the world's leading manufacturers are so deeply and profitably invested in China that large-scale relocation is almost unimaginable, the wage suppression that fueled China's rise is beginning to cause the party as many problems as it once solved. Inequality is rampant; a young, better-educated workforce, cognizant of the new Chinese prosperity and frustrated at their inability to share in it, is no longer content simply to reap the marginal benefits of swapping rural for factory life. Having gone online and seen Par-ee _ or, at least, Shanghai _ there's no keeping them down on the farm or in sweatshops. Thus, the strike wave _ and the government's semi-demi-support for the striking workers. In recent weeks, as Honda factories and others have been shuttered, some provincial governments have raised their minimum wage while national officials have vowed to remedy the plight of the tens of millions of migrants who toil in the factories. The government has permitted media coverage of some strikes, which has highlighted the long hours, low pay and poor working conditions that employees endure. For the moment, strikes are OK in China; spontaneous collective bargaining is fine. Independent unions, however, are not. Yet it seems that the Communist Party doesn't have much to fear. To the extent that strike leaders have been quoted, they make clear that the job actions are about wages and working conditions _ not about challenging the party's hegemony. 'If they give us 800 renminbi a month,' one such striker told the New York Times, 'we'll go back to work right away.' 'There are some demands for independent unions,' says the American attorney, 'but most workers I've encountered stay within the existing Chinese legal system. They want more pay, not a political discourse. This isn't (the Polish union) Solidarity. What they're demanding is a Chinese solution _ collective bargaining but not an ongoing independent organization. Of course, if they begin electing their own leaders within the ACFTU, that would be a challenge to the party. That hasn't happened yet, but they now have experienced the positive effect of their own power.' Genuine labor movements around the world have greeted the strikes with uncharacteristic silence _ in contrast, for instance, to the vocal and material support they gave Solidarity. It's not that they don't welcome the Chinese strikes, says one U.S. union official; they just understand that public support would probably cause the Chinese government to respond with charges of foreign meddling and a harsher crackdown on the striking workers. I wonder, though, whether the declining power of American workers over the past 40 years hasn't increased U.S. union leaders' understanding of the constricted options that Chinese workers confront. In both countries, workers who agitate for unions or for better conditions are frequently fired. In China, to be sure, the consequences seldom stop there; in the United States, employers' penalties for such nominally illegal firings are negligible. No other major industrial nations are as hostile to independent unions as China and the United States. In a 2009 survey of more than 1,000 union elections over the preceding five years, Cornell University professor Kate Bronfenbrenner found that union activists were fired in 34 percent of the campaigns. Efforts to ban such firings foundered this year when the Senate couldn't muster the votes to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. Chinese communism and American capitalism may be two very different systems, but under both, workers assert their rights at their peril. meyersonh@washpost.com "
1,"'Now the trumpet summons us again,' John Benson recited with gusto Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery, quoting from John F. Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address while standing just steps from his grave. The 71-year-old Rhode Island resident knows the famous speech by memory because he carved it into stone. On Thursday, workers began a weeklong project to re-stain the letters Benson hand-carved into 30-ton pieces of Deer Isle granite. The stones sit across from Kennedy's eternal flame, in a plaza frequented by most of the 4 million people who visit the cemetery each year. The Knights of Columbus, a Catholic lay organization, is paying about $6,000 for the restoration to honor the upcoming 50th anniversary of Kennedy's inauguration. 'This guy was a brother Knight; we fondly remember his presidency and want to maintain the memory of the wonderful speeches he gave,' said Knights spokesman Patrick Korten. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president, was a member of the group's Bunker Hill Council 62 in Charlestown, Mass., from 1946 until his death in 1963. Several Knights visited the gravesite last summer and had difficulty reading the carved letters that appeared to be fading in the blazing sun. 'Washington is a place where the great figures in American history have their most famous words emblazoned in granite,' Korten said Thursday. 'You go down to the Lincoln Memorial or the Jefferson Memorial, they're easily readable. This has not been in that state for some while,' he said, pointing to the stones. The group contacted cemetery officials soon after their visit and offered to pay for the work. A Kennedy family spokesman declined comment Thursday on the restoration. Back in 1965 at the age of 25, Benson literally worked hand over fist to carve the speech into place. 'There was no computer cutting back then,' he said, adding that he chose to carve the speech with Roman majuscule, or the capital letters first used on monuments built in 2nd-century Rome. On Thursday, hundreds of schoolchildren and dozens of Italian tourists stopped to admire Benson's work and hear him tell stories about carving the stones to Gordon Ponsford, the man hired to give them new life. Kennedy's words 'are great, but if you draw an inscription as I did maybe 100 times, it takes on a totally different nature and ceases to be a piece of prose or speechifying,' Benson said. 'It becomes an artistic artifact that you're doing your darndest to bring to its highest possible level.' He's pleased that there is renewed interest in the work and that a new team will refinish it. But, he said, 'There's nothing wrong with the wrinkles of old age. It's an added attraction to the appearance.' Ponsford, 51, of Acworth, Ga., has worked on 27 major projects at the cemetery in 22 years, including restoration of the cemetery's Rough Riders Monument, Confederate Memorial and McClellan Gate. He started researching the Kennedy stones shortly after he was hired for the project and discovered that Benson was still alive. Indeed Benson is no stranger to Washington's historic sites. He carved Franklin D. Roosevelt's most famous quotations into stones at his memorial on the Tidal Basin. His son, Nick, did similar work at the World War II Memorial and is working on carvings at the new Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. 'If we had not got this job, perhaps my personal career might not have gone in the precise arc and speed that it did,' Benson said. 'But prior to this and subsequent to this, we got a lot of significant work and good work.' Ponsford was especially pleased to hear from the original artist, a rarity in his line of work. 'Most of the monuments we work on are generally over 100 years old, so we never, ever get to personally meet the carver or sculptor,' he said. 'This is just one of those rare occasions.' Ponsford was also pleased to bring positive attention to the embattled military cemetery, still reeling from revelations of misplaced graves and shoddy recordkeeping. 'There's been too much bad news here lately, so it's time for something good,' he said. "
1,"HOUSTON - Exxon Mobil Corp. on Thursday posted its biggest profit increase since 2003, as rising production helped the largest U.S. oil company take advantage of gains in energy prices. Second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56 billion, or $1.60 a share, from $3.95 billion, or 81 cents, a year earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said Thursday in a statement. Per-share profit was 15 cents higher than the average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's biggest energy company, capitalized on a 31 percent gain in crude prices, as measured by U.S. oil futures, with increased production. Exxon's output climbed 8.4 percent to the equivalent of 4 million barrels of oil a day, and Shell had a 5 percent gain. Exxon's profit increase was its largest since the first quarter of 2003. 'This will probably be the last quarter that we'll see large increases in earnings per share unless oil prices increase significantly from where we are now,' said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Shell said Thursday that its profit rose 15 percent to $4.39 billion. In April, Exxon reported a 38 percent jump in first- quarter net income, marking the company's first profit increase since the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide demand for crude rose an estimated 3.2 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. Exxon said July 8 that it plans to buy back $3 billion of its shares this quarter following its acquisition last month of natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc. The transaction increased outstanding shares at Exxon by about 9 percent. Exxon also said it will look to pay off or refinance $11 billion of assumed debt. Exxon has said the XTO deal is a long-term bet that gas from shale formations and other so-called unconventional resources will meet rising U.S. demand through at least 2030 as output from conventional wells falls. 'They're going to take their XTO expertise and redeploy them in their own properties and try to get more bang for their bucks, and that's what they are very well known for,' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer Co. in New York who has a 'market perform' rating on Exxon shares. He said low gas prices have prevented the deal from helping the company's stock. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, is scheduled to report earnings Friday. "
1,"Angry onlookers shouted 'Disgrace!' and 'Murderer!' at Joran van der Sloot on Friday after a judge ordered him jailed on first-degree murder and robbery charges in the beating and strangling death of a young Lima woman. Prosecutors said the Dutchman, who was taken to a segregated block of an eastern Lima prison, acted with 'ferocity and great cruelty' in killing 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores in his hotel room after they met playing poker. Van der Sloot remains the lone suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway on the Caribbean resort island of Aruba, and Peru's criminal police chief says the defendant told interrogators he knows where her body is. Aruba's attorney general, Taco Stein, told The Associated Press on Friday he is skeptical Van der Sloot was telling the truth about Holloway's body. He said Aruban officials will decide whether to sent investigators to Peru to question him once they learn exactly what he is offering. Lima Superior Court Judge Juan Buendia issued a detention order before dawn for Van der Sloot on the murder charge. He was first taken with other prisoners in an armored truck to Lima's judicial palace, then alone to the maximum-security Castro Castro prison. Police manhandled Van der Sloot as they ushered him to the judicial palace, a scarf around his neck and his hands cuffed behind him. The more virulent catcalls and bile -- the sensational case has dominated Peru's news for a week -- came from onlookers as he was taken from the prosecutor's office where he had been held since Thursday. One onlooker threw spoiled lettuce. Police say Van der Sloot brutally murdered Flores three days after meeting her at a casino. He broke her nose, strangled her, threw her to the floor then emptied her wallet and drove away in her SUV, said Gen. Cesar Guardia, chief of the criminal police. The 6-foot-3 (190-centimeter-tall) Van der Sloot took about $300 worth of Peruvian currency, two credit cards and Flores' national ID card, Guardia said. He said the suspect abandoned her car in a lower-class Lima neighborhood before fleeing south to Chile by bus. If convicted on the murder and robbery charges, Van der Sloot would be sentenced to between 15 and 35 years in prison, court spokesman Luis Gallardo told the AP. 'The aggravating factors are having acted with ferocity and great cruelty,' said a news release issued by the court that announced the charges. At Castro Castro prison, Van der Sloot was fed the Peruvian chicken dish 'seco de pollo,' prisons director Ruben Rodriguez said. The Dutchman will have his own cell in a small block near the director's office. The only other two prisoners on the block are a reputed Colombian hit man charged with strangling a Peruvian socialite and a provincial mayor charged with laundering drug money It was not yet known when the trial might begin. A judge must first be assigned to hear the case. Flores was killed three days after meeting Van der Sloot, police say, and five years to the day after Holloway disappeared. Guardia said 'a wealth of evidence' against the Dutchman includes closed-circuit video tracking him leaving the casino with Flores, entering his room with the woman and then leaving alone. The police chief told the AP on Thursday night that when Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores investigators asked him about the Holloway case. 'He let slip that he knew the place where this person was buried,' Guardia said. The general said the Dutchman told investigators 'he would only testify (on the matter) before Aruba authorities.' He said he didn't know how seriously to take Van der Sloot's comment given his history of dubious statements the Alabama teen's disappearance. Stein, the Aruba attorney general, was cautious about the development. 'I'm not getting my hopes up,' he told the AP. 'Let's face it, he has been telling us many stories many times before.' Stein said that even if Van der Sloot did reveal what happened to Holloway, there was no guarantee her remains would be found. Guardia said Van der Sloot confessed that he killed Flores, the daughter of a circus promoter and former race car driver, because she found out about the Aruba case by using his laptop without his permission. Van der Sloot's newly hired Peruvian attorney, Maximo Altez, has asked the judge to declare his client's Monday confession void on the grounds it was made in the presence of a defense lawyer appointed by police. Reached by the AP, Altez refused to discuss the case. He said Van der Sloot's schoolteacher mother, Anita, would be arriving early next week with the family's own media adviser. The young man's father, a lawyer on Aruba, a Dutch territory, died in February while playing tennis. Van der Sloot arrived in Peru on May 14, authorities say, four days after allegedly receiving $25,000 as part of an FBI sting aimed at resolving the Holloway case. U.S. prosecutors charged him with extortion four days after Flores was killed. Prosecutors say the extortion case began when Van der Sloot contacted a New York lawyer for Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, in April seeking $250,000 in exchange for the location of the young woman's body, how she died and the identity of those involved. The lawyer, John Kelly, contacted the FBI, which secretly recorded video of him giving Van der Sloot $10,000 in cash in Aruba on May 10 while $15,000 was wired to a bank account in the Dutch man's name, prosecutors say. Van der Sloot was recorded telling Kelly he pushed Holloway down, and she hit her head on a rock and died, an affidavit says. He allegedly said his father helped him bury the body. Van der Sloot admitted in a May 17 e-mail -- he was in Peru by then -- that he had lied about the location of Holloway's remains, prosecutors say. That fit a pattern of Van der Sloot making confessions he later retracted. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway before the girl vanished on the last night of a high school graduation trip. He was arrested twice but released both times for a lack of evidence. ------ Associated Press Writers Franklin Briceno and Carla Salazar in Lima and Michael Melia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.

1,"The EU monetary chief says Ireland's debt crisis is all about its troubled banks -- and that the euro currency is not in danger. Olli Rehn says Ireland's troubles were caused by 'very serious problems in the banking sector.' Rehn said the EU, together with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are working on the problem. He expects the 16 countries that use the euro to suppport those efforts at a key meeting in Brussels later Tuesday. Ministers will have to tackle how to stop a sell-off in Irish bonds that has threatened to engulf other vulnerable countries such as Portugal and Spain. He says that the Irish crisis 'is not a matter of the survival of the euro. This is a very serious problem in the banking sector of Ireland.' "
1,"Even by the standards of a bullet- and bomb-dodging Taliban commander, Hakimullah Mehsud has displayed notable survival skills. The Pakistani Taliban chief was believed dead in a leadership duel last summer, only to stage a news conference a few days later. A U.S. drone strike in January was followed by intense speculation about his fate, then statements by Pakistani intelligence officials that he was '100 percent' dead. On Thursday, those intelligence officials circulated another message: Mehsud is alive. Earlier reports of Mehsud's death _ repeated by U.S. officials _ were hailed as a potentially fatal blow to the Pakistani Taliban, a loose network of border- based militants that has carried out a cascade of suicide attacks in recent years. News of his survival again underscored the staying power of a group that Pakistan's military has targeted with unprecedented force in the past year. It also exposed blind spots for the Pakistani and U.S. intelligence services, which struggle to develop reliable information in areas where the Taliban has reigned. Offensives in the tribal areas over the past six months have scattered fighters and prompted some Pakistani officials to deem the group hobbled, but its leadership remained at large and attacks claimed by the Taliban never fully ceased. In the Swat Valley, where the army pushed out militants last spring, a recent string of targeted killings has sparked fears of a Taliban resurgence. But Mehsud is not necessarily back. He may have survived the January attack, but he was wounded, and has been sidelined ever since, three senior intelligence officers said. He has been replaced by Wali ur-Rehman, a South Waziristan commander who was Mehsud's adversary in the leadership duel last August, they said. The twists in Mehsud's reported fate reflect significant human intelligence gaps in Pakistan's craggy tribal areas, officials and analysts said. More than 70 Pakistani agents and informants have been killed in the region since 2004, intelligence officials said, and there are regular reports of suspected spies whose throats are slit by militants. 'There was nobody to confirm it on the ground, actually,' an intelligence official said of Mehsud's fate after the drone strike. 'In these types of attacks ... people come and take out bodies, which is what they play upon _ they say innocent bystanders have been killed.' The drone that slammed into South Waziristan on Jan. 14 was part of a stepped-up campaign of drone attacks carried out by the CIA under the Obama administration. One Pakistani intelligence officer said a video showed that a building where Mehsud was staying had been so obliterated by the strike that analysts believed there could be no survivors. Though no body was found and Taliban fighters insisted Mehsud was alive, officials concluded Mehsud was dead when he did not publicly surface. Electronic and human intelligence gathered since, including intercepted phone calls, indicates otherwise, intelligence officials said. Mehsud's survival was first reported by the British newspaper the Guardian. After the January strike, a White House official called it '95 percent' certain that Mehsud had been killed. U.S. intelligence officials, for their part, continued to express uncertainty, and on Thursday, a U.S. counterterrorism official said there was still no hard evidence either way. But he said it was strange that Mehsud had not emerged to resolve the mystery. 'If Hakimullah really is alive, let him prove it,' said the official, who insisted on anonymity when discussing counterterrorism operations inside Pakistan. 'His group isn't one that traditionally led from the cave, in silence. His absence is the Taliban's problem, not ours. It's already been shown that he can be hit.' U.S. intelligence officials can often make precise assessments of casualties by closely monitoring the targeted buildings after the missiles have hit. But the CIA's drone-mounted cameras cannot always determine the identity of victims or how seriously they are injured. In a telephone interview Thursday, a Taliban fighter in North Waziristan, where Taliban leaders are believed to have taken refuge, said Mehsud had temporarily gone 'underground' but was unhurt and remained the leader _ and would soon produce a video to prove it. The Pakistani intelligence official said he did not know how seriously Mehsud was wounded but said he had been demoted, demonstrating the Taliban's 'fractured' nature. Intelligence officials say Taliban leaders, including Rehman and Mehsud, have been pushed from South Waziristan but remain in the tribal areas. Taliban attacks in Pakistan have dropped off in recent months. The Pakistani official said that trend is a positive sign, but he voiced caution, noting that as many as 8,000 Taliban fighters remain in the tribal areas. 'It could be they are just waiting and gathering troops,' the official said. 'This thing will continue, for sure.' _ Khan is a special correspondent.

1,"Australian and Ne Zalnd sietitshae se pehstri fater t hlpma the color of giant extinct birds and said Wednesday they believe their method could help reconstruct the appearance of other extinct bird species. The researchers retrieved ancient DNA from four species of New Zealand's extinct Moa from feathers found in caves and rock shelters and believed to be at least 2,500 years old. The native Moa -- a flightless, powerfully built forager that stood over 8 feet (2.50 meters) tall and weighed 550 pounds (250 kilograms) -- ranged widely in southern New Zealand before the arrival of man. Using DNA analysis, scientists from New Zealand's Landcare Research and Australia's Adelaide University reconstructed the mainly plain brown plumage of the stout legged Moa, heavy-footed Moa, upland Moa and South Island giant Moa. 'Some had white-tipped feathers to create a speckled appearance' that they used as camouflage, said researcher Nicolas Rawlence from the university's Australian Center for Ancient DNA. The findings were published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. A co-author of the study, Jamie Wood of Landcare Research, said it is likely that the Moa's drab color was to avoid predation by the extinct indigenous Haast's eagle, once the biggest and most powerful eagle in the world. The study notes that the drab camouflage plumage of several other New Zealand native birds, including the flightless Kiwi and flightless nocturnal Kakapo parrot, supports this concept. Moa quickly became extinct after indigenous Maori settled in New Zealand about 1200 A.D. Thereeachshwe i ws osibe o etiee NAfrm ll part o the ancient feathers, not just the tip of the quill as previously thought, Wood said. This important finding opens the way to study DNA from museum birds just by clipping a small part of a single feather, causing almost no damage to the valuable specimens. Ancient DNA center director, Prof. Alan Cooper, said the findings suggest it may be possible to reconstruct the appearance of other extinct birds using feathers from fossil deposits. 'There are so many enigmatic extinct species that it would be great to see 'clothed,'' Cooper said. Alan Tennyson, fossil curator at New Zealand's national museum, called the work 'another step forward to understanding what these extinct birds really looked like ... and their whole interaction with the environment.' Tennyson was not associated with the study. 'We had a vague idea of the color of different Moa species,' he told The Associated Press, 'but this is a breakthrough, actually being able to say these colored feathers came from this species of Moa.'

1,"A speeding car crashed through the entrance of a casino and into a bank of slot machines Wednesday in the southern Nevada resort town of Laughlin, killing two patrons and injuring at least eight other people, authorities said. The 70-year-old driver told investigators he fainted while driving toward the Edgewater Hotel & Casino on the Colorado River waterfront, Las Vegas police Officer Jacinto Rivera said. Witnesses said the Pontiac Vibe drove through a red light, crossed Casino Drive and careened down a horseshoe-shaped driveway into the 26-story hotel. 'Slot machines were just everywhere, just wiped out, tumbled and tossed,' said Bill Kinsey, fire division chief in Bullhead City, Arizona, across the river from Laughlin. The 2,700-pound (1,200-kilogram) car came to rest about 35 feet (10 meters) inside the casino between the hotel registration desk and a cashier cage. One of the people killed was wedged beneath the car and slot machines, Kinsey said. Joe Magliarditi, the casino's chief operating officer, said he had heard the car was going at least 60 mph (100 kph). Police identified the driver as Walter McGie of Kelso, Washington. None of the victims were identified. Authorities said McGie was jailed on two counts of felony reckless driving causing death. Rivera said there was no evidence the driver applied the brakes before the crash. Investigators planned to examine the vehicle for mechanical malfunctions. The 2007 Vibe involved in the crash was not part of two Toyota recalls that recently affected millions of cars in the United States because of a risk of unintended acceleration. The car, however, is a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors Co., and the 2009 and 2010 models were recalled last month because of a risk of the driver-side floor mat trapping the gas pedal, causing unintended acceleration. General Motors spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the design of the Vibe changed significantly between the 2008 and 2009 model years. The 2007 Vibe has an excellent overall safety record, he said. ---------- Associated Press Writer Oskar Garcia in Las Vegas contributed to this report. "
1,"A female Belgian skydiver went on trial for murder Friday, accused of allegedly killing the woman who was both her good friend and her lover's paramour by sabotaging the woman's parachute. The prosecutors said jealousy drove Els Clottemans to kill Els Van Doren four years ago by turning their shared passion for skydiving into a murder weapon. Clottemans, 26, has vehemently denied the murder charges and accusations that she killed Van Doren so she could have the man, another Dutch skydiver, all to herself. Belgian privacy laws make it impossible to identify him. The case has captured the imagination of this nation since Van Doren fell from 13,000 feet (4,500 meters) into a suburban garden in eastern Belgium after both her parachute and her reserve parachute did not open on Nov. 18, 2006. A married mother of two and an experienced skydiving enthusiast, Van Doren had jumped from a plane together with Clottemans, their Dutch lover and another skydiver intending to perform tricks in the sky. Clottemans, however, jumped a fraction too late and did not join the maneuvers with the other three. When the sign was given to open the parachutes, Van Doren struggled with her cords before hurling toward the ground. Clottemans became a prime suspect when she attempted suicide hours before she was to make a second statement to police a month after the incident. The investigation revealed that Clottemans had a relationship with the same skydiver as Van Doren. Prosecutors allege that Clottemans had tampered with Van Doren's parachute and cut two vital cords before the jump. No hard evidence has surfaced so far to support the murder charge, but prosecutors hope the circumstantial links will secure a conviction. Chief defense lawyer Vic Van Aelst said prosecutors 'have nothing' to tie his client to the death. 'They have to prove they have something, but they have been trying to do it for four years and it is not going very well for them,' Vic Van Aelst said. The trial opened Friday with jury selection and is expected to last a month. Media interest was so extensive that authorities used a room next to the courthouse so journalists could follow the proceedings through remote video. "

The 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' star will appear in Chinese director Jiang Wen's upcoming movie 'Let the Bullets Fly,' Hong Kong's Emperor Motion Pictures said in a statement late Tuesday. Jiang will also co-star, along with Chinese comedian Ge You. Chow will play a ruthless but humorous Chinese criminal during Nationalist Party rule in early to mid-20th century China, Emperor Motion Pictures said. The statement did not reveal the plot. 'Let the Bullets Fly' will be released in late 2010. Chow made his name with stylish Hong Kong gangster thrillers like 'A Better Tomorrow' before making his Hollywood debut with the 1998 action movie 'The Replacement Killers.' His other American credits include 'Anna and the King,' 'Bulletproof Monk,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,' and 'Dragonball Evolution.' The 54-year-old actor was most recently shooting a biopic of the ancient Chinese thinker Confucius. One of China's biggest stars, Jiang has also turned to directing, making his debut with the 1994 film, 'In the Heat of the Sun.' His most recent film was the 2007 comedy 'The Sun Also Rises.' He also shot a segment in the recently released anthology 'New York, I Love You.' "
1,"WASHINGTON - Almost a million workers, a third of them members of New York's teachers union, were left out of a consumer protection in health law meant to cap insurance costs after the government exempted their employers. Thirty companies and organizations, including Jack in the Box Inc. and the United Federation of Teachers, won't be required to raise the minimum annual benefit included in low- cost health plans covering seasonal, part-time or low- wage employees. The Department of Health and Human Services said it granted waivers in late September so workers with minimum plans would keep coverage without major premium increases. The agency provided the list of exemptions. 'The big political issue here is the president promised no one would lose the coverage they've got,' Robert Laszewski, chief executive officer of consulting company Health Policy and Strategy Associates, said by telephone. 'Here we are a month before the election, and these companies represent 1 million people who would lose the coverage they've got, so the administration can't fall into that trap.' The biggest single waiver, for 351,000 people, was for the United Federation of Teachers Welfare Fund, a New York union providing coverage for city teachers. The United Agricultural Benefit Trust, the California-based cooperative that offers coverage to farm workers, got to exempt 17,347 people. San Diego-based Jack in the Box's waiver is for 1,130 workers, while McDonald's asked to excuse 115,000. The plans will be exempt from rules put in place this year intended to keep people from having to pay for all their care once they reach a preset coverage cap. In McDonald's case, workers receive so-called mini-med programs as a low- cost way to cover part-time employees with limited benefits. McDonald's told the Obama administration it may re-evaluate the plans unless it got a waiver. The Department of Health and Human Services said last week the administration was providing exemptions. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., and Jack in the Box didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is leading a congressional investigation of whether limited-benefit plans provide sufficient coverage and give fair value to workers, he said in a letter last week. Laszewski says Rockefeller's investigation misses the point, because companies can't afford to spend more on health coverage for lower-wage employees. 'These tend to be part-time workers or workers at minimum wage,' he said. 'You've got people that are making $12,000, $14,000 per year.' For traditional insurance, an average annual premium purchased through work was $4,824 in 2009, according to the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Kaiser Family Foundation. 'What the McDonald's of the world are doing is the best they can,' Laszewski said. While the limited benefit plans may not cover the cost of a major health- care episode, they give patients access to the lower prices of networks of doctors and hospitals, and may provide some up-front coverage, he said. 'Do they cover somebody who has cancer and has to go into the hospital? No, but they cut the cost in half,' he said. The waiver program is intended to provide continuous coverage until 2014, when new government-organized marketplaces will offer insurance subsidized by tax credits, said Jessica Santillo, a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman. Until those subsidized plans are available, the government wanted to avoid imposing rules that may result in people getting excluded from the limited benefit plans, she said. The plans are popular with companies that have workers who don't earn enough to afford coverage, or whose workforces might be prohibitively expensive to insure, said Daryl Richard, a spokesman for Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth Group Inc., which offers limited-benefit plans to about a dozen companies. The waivers are effective for a year and were granted to insurance plans and companies who showed that employee premiums would rise significantly or that workers would lose coverage without them, Santillo said in an e-mailed statement. The administration announced the waiver program in a Sept. 3 memo. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, a mailroom error may cost an Alabama death row inmate his last, best chance to challenge his sentence. The inmate, Cory Maples, was convicted of murdering two people in Alabama in 1995. His legal defense was pitiful. One of his lawyers told the jury: '(W)hat we have here is ( Maples) walking out to the car and in an instantaneous rush killing two people.' At another point, a defense lawyer asserted that 'there was a loss of life caused intentionally at the hand of' Maples. The lawyers failed to introduce evidence that Maples was highly intoxicated the night of the murders _ a fact that could have undercut the case for capital punishment. By a vote of 10 to 2 _ the minimum required by Alabama law _ a jury sentenced Maples to death. Alabama appeals courts upheld Maples' convictions. A judge's order denying the last of Maples' state appeals was mailed to Maples' two appellate lawyers in New York, but the letters were sent back unopened and stamped 'return to sender' because the lawyers had left the law firm but failed to inform the Alabama court. An Alabama lawyer acting as local counsel received the same letter but disregarded it, assuming that the New York lawyers would continue to take the lead. The court's clerks office also did nothing. As a result, a deadline for filing a federal challenge passed. Maples immediately took action when he learned of the series of errors, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied his request to proceed, essentially concluding that he had to pay the consequences for his lawyers' mistakes. Maples has appealed to the Supreme Court, which should take up the case to correct this egregious injustice. We oppose capital punishment, but if it is to be carried out, it must be done with legal protections strictly observed. It is just wrong to strip a person facing execution of his legal right to a federal challenge because someone else was irresponsible. Alabama and many other states have laws that purport to give defendants a second chance when another's error thwarts due process. This safety net was not applied fairly in this instance. The court should use the Maples case to put states on alert that they must conscientiously apply such provisions. Four years ago, the justices decided a case in which a state intended to sell a piece of private property to satisfy the owner's unpaid taxes; the notice of the impending sale was returned unopened. The court concluded in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that the state could not take or sell the property before it made additional efforts to alert the owner. The standard should be no lower when the state seeks to take a life. "
1,"Tens of thousands of Thai protesters rode motorcycles and trucks Tuesday through cheering crowds in Bangkok, defying a police ban in a show of strength that may increase pressure on Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to call an election. Bystanders handed out water and boiled eggs to the red- shirted demonstrators as they occupied the commercial business district for a fourth day, seeking to provoke a police response that might bolster their campaign. An explosion outside the ruling party's headquarters injured two police officers, TNN television reported, without citing a source for the information. 'I am determined to enforce the law to maintain social order, but it will take time,' Abhisit said in a nationally televised address. 'Some of you may be unsatisfied. I urge your patience. The government will do our best to bring normalcy back to Thai society.' Abhisit said security forces exercised restraint 'to avoid confrontation' as tensions heightened after three weeks of mostly peaceful rallies. Broadening support within Bangkok would expand a largely rural movement that risks undermining a recovery from Thailand's first recession in a decade. 'The protesters' ability to rotate people in from the countryside and get help from people in Bangkok makes the likelihood they are going to quit and leave the city quite low,' said Michael Montesano, a visiting research fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. 'The past week has made it undeniable that this is now a social movement.' Nurses, maids, restaurant workers, and executives in suits cheered on groups of protesters as they fanned out along 11 roads in downtown Bangkok that police had barred them from entering. Police and soldiers retreated after first attempting to block them. Force won't be used to disperse the crowd, Piya Uthayo, spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Bureau, said in a televised announcement after a scuffle. Thailand's Internal Security Act, in place since the rallies began, gives the military power to clear streets and make arrests. A year ago, soldiers quashed similar protests by Abhisit's opponents that started peacefully and turned violent. The prime minister said he may cancel a trip to the United States next week if the situation isn't resolved by April 10. The demonstrators, who say they represent lower classes of society, want an immediate election. They say the constitution written after the military ousted ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra in a 2006 coup gives too much power to palace aides, judges, bureaucrats and soldiers at the expense of elected politicians. Since 1946, when King Bhumibol Adulyadej took the throne as an 18-year-old, the country has seen more than 20 prime ministers and nine coups. Only two of 17 Thai constitutions since absolute monarchy ended in 1932 have mandated fully elected parliaments. 'It's up to the government whether this will end violently,' said Krit Keerakiatwong, 42, owner of a Bangkok export business who has transformed his factory into a makeshift kitchen to provide meals for protesters. 'It's not easy for them to give away power, especially not to a group of mostly poor people.' Abhisit's opponents say he is illegitimate because he became prime minister in December 2008 after a court dissolved the pro-Thaksin ruling party for election fraud. They rejected his offer to call an election within nine months, demanding he step down within two weeks. Thaksin and his allies have won the past four elections on strong support in rural areas for his platform of cheap health care and village loans. The billionaire former prime minister has orchestrated protests from overseas since fleeing a Thai jail sentence in 2008. Abhisit has asserted his right to complete his term in office. He must call an election by the end of 2011. His Democrat party may win as many as 240 seats in a new ballot, or half the total, he said in a March 22 interview. The demonstrators plan to remain outside Bangkok's largest luxury shopping malls even if the court approves arrest warrants, Nattawut said Monday. Thailand's financial markets are closed Tuesday for a public holiday commemorating the founding of the Chakri Dynasty in 1782.

1,"A plainclothes police officer chased a Times Square scam artist through sidewalks crowded with holiday shoppers and tourists Thursday before fatally shooting the suspect near a landmark hotel, police said. No one else was injured in the exchange of gunfire that shattered a Broadway theater and gift shop windows. The 25-year-old suspect was believed to be conning tourists along Broadway and 46th Street when he was recognized just before noon by a sergeant who runs a task force that monitors aggressive begging, chief NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said. The officer approached and asked the suspect and another man for identification, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. One of the men took off running into the streets and through the Marriott Marquis hotel's passenger drop-off area, Browne said. The sergeant pursued and the man turned and fired a stolen Mac-10 machine pistol that held 30 rounds, shooting two rounds before it jammed, police said. The officer fired four times, striking the suspect in the chest and arm, killing him, Kelly said. Dave Kinmahan, a tourist from Boston, was parking his car in a spot below street level at the hotel when he saw one man shooting another. 'I was 20 yards away,' Kinmahan said. He said he thought, 'Is this real or this a movie?' The hotel is located in the Broadway theater district and near the heart of Times Square. The Marquis Theatre, where 'White Christmas' is now playing, is in the hotel. Bullets from the gunfight shattered the window of the 'Broadway Baby' gift shop and a side window of the box office on the street, police said. Dozens of police officers surrounded the popular hotel, taping off the valet parking area as tourists and shoppers stopped to watch the commotion. Kathleen Duffy, a spokeswoman for New York City Marriott Hotels, said the shooting took place in a taxi pickup and drop-off area. The slain man was not immediately identified. Officers suspected him and his partner were working a scam in which they would approach tourists, ask them their names, then write their names on the CDs and demand payment of $10. The suspect had been wanted for assault in the Bronx, but the officer approached him because he was recognized as an aggressive begger, authorities said. There were 27 live rounds left in his gun, which had been reported stolen in Virginia, authorities said. Duncan Stewart, a Broadway casting director for National Artists Management Co., has a 12th-floor office that overlooks Times Square. He said he was on the phone when he heard three loud pops. 'With the echo, I didn't quite know what it was, but within five minutes, there were cars, police sirens, cops running,' he said. 'It was chaotic.' Stewart has worked in Times Square for the past three years. He's gotten used to seeing the weird and wacky, but almost never anything violent. 'It's bizarre. It's one thing to see the Naked Cowboy day after day in Times Square, but a shooting is something different altogether,' he said. New York City's crackdown on begging began under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, when 'zero-tolerance' policing was instituted to curb quality-of-life offenses. Begging, public drinking, public urinating, graffiti and disorderly conduct were all part of the crackdown as a way to bring order to the city by sending the message that no crime would be tolerated. When Mayor Michael Bloomberg first took office in 2002, one of the first things he did was launch 'Operation Clean Sweep,' aimed at those same quality-of-life problems. By the end of Bloomberg's first term, the program had resulted in some 33,000 arrests and 350,000 summonses. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said the NYPD 'will assert the public's right to be left alone by aggressively going after quality-of-life violators.' ------ Associated Press writers Sara Kugler, Colleen Long, Adam Goldman and Chad Roedemeier contributed to this report.

1,"Monsanto says it won't block competitors from creating generic versions of any of its gene- modified seeds as they lose patent protection, a decision that may help mute calls for an antitrust case against the world's largest seedmaker. Farmers for the first time will be allowed to save and replant Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans after the patent expires in 2014 and rivals such as DuPont will be able to sell their own Roundup-tolerant seeds without restriction, Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant said in an interview. Farmers criticized Monsanto in the 2008 documentary 'Food Inc.' for its contracts that keep them from saving seeds after a harvest. 'Here is how we think patent expiration will look,' Grant said. 'Farmers will be free to plant, to replant that seed. Licensees will be able to do the same thing.' Monsanto could have thwarted proposed generics by raising multiple patent claims or safety questions with regulators, as some drugmakers do. Grant said his decision not to throw up obstacles starting with the 2015 planting sets the template the company expects to follow as other advances such as insect resistance come off patent later in the decade, pushing beyond his previous comments on the topic. 'We are setting this as a precedent,' Chief Technology Officer Robert Fraley said at the Jan. 8 interview in Bloomberg's Chicago office. Roundup Ready soybeans are engineered to withstand Monsanto's Roundup, the world's most popular weed-killer. Contracts protect its patents in part by prohibiting farmers from saving seeds from one year's crop to plant in the next. The Justice Department will hold a March workshop on crop-seed competition and has made inquiries into allegations from DuPont that Monsanto unfairly uses genetic licenses to dominate the engineered seed market. Including seeds made by licensees, about 93 percent of U.S. soybean plantings last year contained Monsanto's Roundup Ready trait. Grant's lawyers in May sued DuPont to keep it from engineering seed that resists Roundup in two ways, with the patented Roundup Ready trait licensed from Monsanto plus DuPont's own genetic technology. 'Companies like DuPont will be able to stack' any genetic traits they develop on the new generics, Grant said. David Begleiter, a New York-based analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Monsanto's decision is 'part of their overall response to the growing antitrust pressure coming out of Washington.' 'By allowing generics, they are trying to push back on the claim that their business practices are anti-competitive,' Begleiter said. Monsanto has broadly licensed its genetic technology to rival seed makers since 1996, when it began selling Roundup Ready soybeans, its first engineered seed, Grant said. The company also allows competitors to combine other genetic traits with its technology, a process known as stacking, with one or two exceptions, Grant said. DuPont's Pioneer Hi-Bred unit, the biggest U.S. soybean seed producer, violated one of those exceptions when it stacked Monsanto's Roundup Ready gene with a second gene that allows crops to resist the same glyphosate-based herbicide, Grant said. Monsanto sued DuPont in May to block the Optimum GAT soy and corn seeds, and DuPont countersued, claiming Monsanto was using monopoly power to block innovation. DuPont subsequently delayed commercial sales of both products until the middle of the decade. While that's around the time Monsanto plans to allow competitors, including DuPont, to copy the off-patent Roundup Ready technology, Grant said he won't drop the lawsuit because 'five years is a ways away.' Monsanto's promise to allow generic versions of its crop seeds doesn't guarantee generics will reach the market, said James Denvir III, a Washington-based attorney for DuPont. Denvir, who led the Justice Department's breakup of AT&T, said Monsanto's promise isn't legally binding and may not allow time for rivals to get export approvals for gene-modified crops they develop from markets such as the European Union or China. 'There are a lot of questions that remain,' Denvir said. 'It's not at all clear that generic competition will ever happen. We want the way to be absolutely cleared for generic competition.' The biotech seed industry lacks the type of legal framework for generic drugs created in 1984 by the Hatch Waxman Act, Denvir said. Monsanto's pledge also doesn't address the issue of blocking competitors from combining genetic traits that involve Monsanto technology, he said. While the competing suits are just a contractual dispute between competitors, the Justice Department inquiry is another matter, Grant said. Monsanto and DuPont filed comments on industry competition with the Justice Department last week. 'If you are in a dialogue with the government, you take it seriously,' said Grant, 51. 'I feel very good about our business practices.' Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. "
1,"Triple Olympic gold medalist Stephanie Rice says she has undergone successful surgery on her right shoulder to repair a long-term injury which threatened her buildup to the 2012 London Olympics. Rice told followers on the social networking site Twitter Wednesday that the surgery in Melbourne was apparently successful. 'Just got out of surgery. Things went well, thank you God,' Rice tweeted. Rice opted for surgery while representing Australia at last month's Pan Pacific championships in Irvine, California, taking a decision which ruled her out of October's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.

1,"Nico Hulkenberg of Williams surprisingly took pole position for the Brazilian Grand Prix, beating the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was fourth and championship leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari fifth. Hulkenberg stunned the field with a fastest lap of 1 minute, 14.470 seconds at the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) Interlagos track, while Vettel clocked 1:15.519 and Webber set a time of 1:15.637. It was the first pole for Hulkenberg, who took advantage of a damp track in the session that set the field for a race that could decide the Formula One championship. Five drivers are still in contention with two races to go, but only Alonso can clinch the championship in Brazil. Webber, Hamilton, Vettel and Jenson Button are trying to extend the title race into the season-finale on Nov. 14 in Abu Dhabi. Alonso has 231 points, 11 more than Webber and 21 more than Hamilton. Vettel is 25 points back and Button is 42 behind. The win is worth 25 points. It rained overnight and all morning long in Sao Paulo and the final practice session took place under very wet conditions. It stopped raining before qualifying, however, and drivers were able to run on intermediate tires on the damp track. Everyone put on slicks in the final minutes and Hulkenberg was the one who made the most of his runs. 'It's amazing, I still can't believe it,' he said. 'To go on slicks was obviously the right decision. I was squeezing everything out of my car.' The Red Bulls had set the pace in the first day of practices on Friday, with Vettel leading Webber in both sessions in dry conditions. Their rivals had been hoping for rain on Saturday to try to reduce the Red Bull's advantage and even the field going into qualifying and the race on Sunday. 'We were targeting for pole but Nico was better than all of us today,' Vettel said. 'I'm still very happy with second.' The Red Bulls were trying to win their 15th pole in 18 races this season. Vettel had won nine and Webber five, although the team has not been able to translate its dominance into nearly as many race wins, thanks mostly to driver mistakes and mechanical failures. Vettel has won only three times this season and Webber four. Rain caused havoc in last year's qualifying session at Interlagos, sending top contenders to the back of the grid. Button had to start in 14th place, with Vettel in 15th and Hamilton in 17th. To win his third F1 title in Brazil, Alonso needs to win Sunday's race and hope Webber finishes fifth or worse. The Spaniard can also secure the title if he finishes second and Webber places eighth or worse, Hamilton is fourth or worse and Vettel second or worse. The drivers' championship has been decided at the Brazilian GP in the last five years. Button won it with Brawn GP in 2009, as did Hamilton with McLaren in 2008 and Kimi Raikkonen with Ferrari in 2007. It was at Interlagos that Alonso won his first two titles, in 2005 and '06, with Renault. He is debuting with Ferrari after a disappointing year with McLaren in 2007 and two seasons with Renault before replacing Kimi Raikkonen in the Italian team. Force India's Adrian Sutil and Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi automatically lost five grid position after being penalized for causing collisions at the Korean GP two weeks ago. "

1,"A federal judge in New York has ruled that a defendant held for nearly five years at a secret CIA prison and at the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, did not have his right to a speedy trial violated and can be prosecuted for involvement in the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings. The ruling, released Tuesday, is a significant victory for the government because it closes a legal avenue to challenge prosecutions for all high-value detainees who were held by the CIA and at Guantanamo Bay, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Although the government has postponed decisions on further federal prosecutions of Guantanamo Bay detainees, including Mohammed, the ruling keeps that option open. A loss would have effectively forced the government to keep all major prosecutions in military commissions, something it might yet have to do, but for political, not legal, reasons. Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian, had sought to have his indictment dismissed on Sixth Amendment grounds, arguing that the government could have prosecuted him at the time of his capture in 2004 or could have questioned him for national security reasons, but that it could not legally do both. A former Islamic cleric, Ghailani was seized by Pakistani authorities after a 10-hour shootout in the Pakistani city of Gujrat in July 2004 and turned over to the United States. He was taken to several secret CIA facilities overseas before he and 13 other high-value detainees _ including Mohammed _ were transferred to Cuba in 2006. At a 2007 military hearing at Guantanamo Bay, Ghailani attempted to present himself as an unwitting participant in the embassy bombings. Federal prosecutors, however, allege that Ghailani, now 36, obtained bomb materials, scouted the embassy in the Tanzanian capital and escorted an Egyptian suicide bomber from Kenya to Dar es Salaam before the attack. The bombing in Tanzania, and another in Kenya, killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Shortly before the attack, Ghailani, using a fake passport, fled to Afghanistan. Military prosecutors said he worked as a trainer at a terrorist camp there. He was sent to the Southern District of New York for prosecution in June 2009 by the Obama administration, its first and only transfer of a Guantanamo Bay detainee to the federal courts. A subsequent plan to transfer Mohammed and four co-defendants to New York was suspended because of intense local and congressional opposition. The Ghailani prosecution has continued and he is expected to be tried this fall. 'Although the delay of this proceeding was long and entirely the product of decisions for which the executive branch is responsible, the decisions that caused the delay were not made for the purpose of gaining any advantage over Ghailani in the prosecution of this indictment,' U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled. 'Two years of the delay served compelling interests of national security.' Kaplan said that Ghailani's subsequent detention at Guantanamo Bay as an enemy combatant was also justified and did not infringe on his rights. In a separate decision Tuesday, a federal appeals court overturned a lower court judge's ruling that Guantanamo Bay detainee Mohammed al-Adahi be released. The three-judge panel unanimously decided that there is sufficient evidence that Adahi met with Osama bin Laden and attended an al-Qaida training camp. _ The Associated Press contributed to this report.

1,"An Austrian judge on Thursday found the former president of the constitutional court guilty in a defamation case linked to an infamous kidnapping victim. Ludwig Adamovich, who also heads a commission examining the abduction, appeared in court in the Austrian capital after suggesting that Natascha Kampusch's captivity was better than what she went through beforehand. Kampusch was snatched off a Vienna street in 1998 and held in a windowless cell until she escaped at age 18 in August 2006. Her kidnapper, Wolfgang Priklopil, committed suicide hours after she fled. Kampusch's mother filed the lawsuit. Judge Birgit Schneider ordered Adamovich to pay a (EURO)10,000 fine ($14,407), half of which will be suspended. His lawyer Christoph Herbst announced he would appeal. 'It's still a pending case because we're challenging the ruling,' Herbst told The Associated Press. During the Christmas Eve hearing, Adamovich continued to express doubts about Kampusch's childhood and said there were indications her captivity may not have been as 'dark' as it has appeared to be, APA reported. Among other things, he referenced a list of places outside Kampusch's cell that she had supposedly been to -- including a swimming pool next to Priklopil's home. "
1,"Another video featuring Senate candidate Mark Kirk of Illinois making false claims of being the Navy's intelligence officer of the year has surfaced as he campaigns for a seat once held by President Barack Obama. Kirk, a five-term Republican congressman and Navy reservist from Chicago's northern suburbs, said last week that the 1999 award was actually given to an ad-hoc intelligence team he created and ran, not to him individually. A Senate campaign Web video made the intelligence officer of the year assertion as an image of Kirk, 50, in a fighter jet is shown. Previously, the only reported video of Kirk making the claim was on C-SPAN during a 2002 congressional hearing. 'It's fitting that a campaign video designed to introduce Congressman Mark Kirk to the people of Illinois includes prominent mention of an award he didn't receive,' said Matt McGrath, a spokesman for Alexi Giannoulias, the Democrat competing for the seat. 'He is a typical Washington politician who will say anything for political gain.' The misstatement about the award was first reported by the Washington Post on May 29. The Kirk campaign video is archived on the YouTube video service on the Internet. Over the Memorial Day weekend -- one devoted to honoring military service -- Giannoulias and Kirk fought over the character issue in a race that could help determine control of the Senate. The correction by Kirk, who has made his military service a central part of his campaign, comes as candidates face greater scrutiny about such claims following misstatements by Democrat Richard Blumenthal, a Senate candidate in Connecticut, about service in Vietnam. 'My corrected biography accurately shows I received the United States Navy Rufus L. Taylor Intelligence Award,' Kirk said last week. 'I will not let my 21 years of service in uniform be denigrated by Alexi Giannoulias, a man who chose not to serve.' Kirk also called Giannoulias, 34, a 'failed mob banker,' a reference to a family bank that made loans to people with criminal records that was closed by regulators in April. The seat Kirk and Giannoulias are fighting for is now held by Sen. Roland Burris, a Democrat who was appointed to finish the term Obama won in 2004. Burris isn't seeking a full term. "
1,"BRUSSELS, Belgium - U.S. and NATO officials said Thursday that they expect the military alliance to formally participate in the Obama administration's plan for a missile defense shield over Europe, scheduled to be activated next year. 'Based on today's discussion, I am quite optimistic,' NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters after a joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers from the alliance membership. 'There is, I think, a broad agreement that we should make such a decision, but there is still some technical work to do.' NATO is scheduled to vote at a summit in Lisbon, Portugal, next month on whether to make missile defense a formal part of its mission. If it does, European alliance members would plug their individual defense systems into a broader missile shield that the Obama administration is building to guard against potential attacks from Iran. The United States would foot most of the bill for building and operating the shield over Europe. The combined cost for other NATO members to link into the system is projected to be about $200 million over 10 years, Rasmussen said. Although U.S. and NATO officials said they are close to a consensus on missile defense, there are still hurdles to overcome. Turkey, a NATO member and neighbor of Iran that would host a key anti-missile radar installation, has yet to commit. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with their Turkish counterparts on the sidelines of the NATO meeting Thursday to discuss whether Turkey will allow a high-powered X-band radar on its territory. The location of the radar is the last unresolved piece in the first phase of the Pentagon's missile defense shield for Europe. 'I would say that we are not putting pressure on the Turks, but we are having continuing conversations with them as one of our allies,' Gates said at a news conference in Brussels. Although Turkey is a longtime NATO member, its government has developed closer ties with Iran in recent years and appears reluctant to take steps that Tehran might consider hostile. Turkish officials have also sought guarantees that the anti-missile shield would cover the eastern part of their country, which borders Iran. Pentagon officials are seeking Turkey's agreement to host the radar installation but also to vote in favor of missile defense as a NATO mission at next month's summit. Because NATO operates by consensus, Turkish opposition could scuttle the alliance's plans. 'We've had some very good, deep discussions with Turkey, and now the decisions are in Ankara to make,' Jim Townsend Jr., deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. Pentagon officials said they have been negotiating with other NATO allies in southern Europe to host the radar in case Turkey balks. One alternative is Bulgaria, which like Turkey borders the Black Sea but is farther from Iran. The radar installation - along with mobile radars deployed on Navy ships in the Mediterranean and Black seas - would provide a critical early warning of any launches from Iran, improving the odds of shooting down a missile. Obama announced in September 2009 that he was overhauling the Bush administration's plans for missile defense in Europe. Although Obama had previously expressed skepticism of Bush's approach, he directed the Pentagon to build a more extensive and flexible missile shield for Europe that will be built in phases between now and 2020.

1,"When you gotta grill, you gotta grill, and Sgt. BBQ was not going let a little thing like a war stop him from enjoying that most primal of cooking experiences. Sgt. BBQ is not his real name, of course. Because the U.S. Army does not always have a sense of humor about these sorts of things, that's what I'll call him. He's a soldier who was on his third deployment to Afghanistan last year when he decided to take on the challenge of grilling in a war zone. For help with that, he turned to Ben Eisendrath. Ben lives in Washington. He used to be an executive at AOL. Ben knows his bits from his bytes, but when he was growing up in Michigan, he acquired another skill: building barbecue grills. His father, Charles, a journalist-turned-college professor, invented a barbecue grill and founded a company, Grillworks, to make them. 'I grew up with the grill business always there,' said Ben, 40. 'It was something that was bred into me. I used to stamp serial numbers into them for my allowance.' In 1999, Charles decided he'd had enough of the BBQ biz and shut down the company. In 2007, Ben left AOL and started Grillworks back up again. He runs it from his rowhouse. The grills his company makes are not the flimsy hibachis you find on apartment balconies. His grills are impressive stainless-steel constructions made in Michigan by workers experienced in crafting custom cars. They feature a firebox for kiln-dried wood, a grill that can be raised or lowered up to 16 inches, and a channeled cooking surface that is canted at 4 degrees to catch and collect tasty juices. In a world of Hyundais, these are Cadillacs. The most popular model retails for $4,400. Sgt. BBQ was flipping through a magazine in eastern Afghanistan when he came across a photo of Ben's grill. He knew it would be superior to the jury-rigged equipment that he'd been trying to grill on. He found Grillworks online and wrote Ben an e-mail: 'My interpreter and I talked with several Afghan blacksmiths about the grate top that I am trying to build but the parts about `V-grates and 4 degree angles' just don't cross over effectively from English to Pashtu or Dari.' Sgt. BBQ wondered whether Ben might have some old cooking surfaces or factory seconds lying around the workshop. 'He asked if I had any spare parts,' Ben told me. 'Me sort of having a patriotic streak, I just called the shop and said, `Let's make up some surfaces and send them to Afghanistan.' We sent four of them, which is not an easy thing to do.' Nor is it easy to barbecue on an Afghan forward operating base. Sgt. BBQ never had Taliban climbing the wire while he grilled, but he did have a couple of rockets land a few hundred yards away one barbecue evening early in his deployment. 'But we got a lot of rockets at that location, so it wasn't a big deal,' he said. The bigger challenge was getting meat. 'What you have to do is like beg and barter,' he said. He worked contacts, and his contacts worked contacts, until the chopper flights to his base held cases of chicken breasts and the occasional steaks for his thrice-weekly barbecues. He and his friends stockpiled condiments from the dining hall. He glazed with packets of sweet and sour sauce and marinated with apple juice and pineapple juice, salt and sugar. 'To many, (grilling in a war zone) would seem strange but most of us had several tours in combat zones so it was never something we considered different,' Sgt. BBQ wrote in an e-mail. 'We just made the best of the situation because that's what we do.' You can eat your food all different ways. You can munch it raw. You can microwave it. If you're a soldier in the U.S. Army, you can rip open an MRE. But that just provides physical nourishment. It doesn't provide the community we feel at a Fourth of July barbecue, a Father's Day cookout, a Labor Day pig roast. 'It was a really good release for all of us: looking at a live fire and the low sizzle of good smelling food,' Sgt. BBQ wrote. 'We lived for a while in chaos and that was a respite (of) some sort and I am sure there were good psychological benefits as well. Grilling is a straight-up guy thing and we took it to the next level.' Sgt. BBQ is back Stateside now. He left two of Ben's grill surfaces in Afghanistan for his replacement unit and took two home to take back to Afghanistan with him in case he's deployed again. He doesn't know if he will be. One thing he does know: When he retires _ he's eligible in a year _ Sgt. BBQ is opening a barbecue restaurant in Mississippi. He's already placed an order with Ben. kellyj@washpost.com "

1,"Woody Allen has restated his support for fellow filmmaker Roman Polanski, who is in house arrest in connection with a 33-year-old sex scandal. Allen said Polanski 'was embarrassed by the whole thing,' 'has suffered' and 'has paid his dues.' He said Polanski is 'an artist and is a nice person' who 'did something wrong and he paid for it.' Polanski pleaded guilty in 1978 to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. He was taken into custody in September and is currently under house arrest in Geneva. Earlier this week, new allegations surfaced when a British actress claimed Polanski had sexually abused her when she was 16. It was not clear whether Allen was aware of the new allegations when he made the remarks in an interview Saturday with France Info radio from the Cannes Film Festival. Allen had previously signed a petition calling for Polanski's release. Allen's relationship with actress Mia Farrow ended in scandal and New York tabloid headlines in 1992, when she found out he was having an affair with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. Allen married Previn in 1997. ------ On the Net: "
1,"Now that spring's leafy green canopies are full overhead, it's possible to dine underneath them again. Or you can bring the essence of light, breezy outdoor dining to an indoor table. This project borrows a simple technique from childhood arts-and-crafts camp: using leaves to create single prints. The result offers a rare combination: bold while understated, indoors or out. Leaves that are fresh and pliable work best. Look for ones with raised veins that will transfer to your fabric. You can sew your own place mats, or simply embellish a store-bought set. Or use the technique on a table runner or napkins if you prefer. Experiment on scrap material first to get a sense of how much paint and pressure to use, and to find out which leaves will create the most striking images. You'll need: _ Store-bought or handmade place mats in a natural fabric such as linen or cotton _ Iron and ironing board _ Textile paint _ Foam brush _ Plain paper _ Brayer, rolling pin or tall glass How to: 1. If you're making the place mats, use one yard of linen or cotton to create a set of four. Cut four 14-by-19-inch rectangles, fold each edge a quarter-inch to the back of the fabric, and press. Fold in another quarter-inch, press, and stitch the edges. 2. Wash and dry the place mats; press if necessary. 3. Working on a covered surface, use a foam brush to apply a thin coat of textile paint to the underside of a leaf. 4. Place the leaf paint-side down on a place mat. 5. Lay a piece of scrap paper on top of the leaf to catch excess paint. 6. Roll a brayer, rolling pin or straight glass over the paper, making sure to roll over every part of the leaf. 7. Remove the paper, then carefully pull up the leaf to reveal the image. 8. Repeat for as many place mats as desired. 9. Heat-set the print according to the directions on the textile paint. This ensures that the color is locked into the fabric so the place mats can be washed. Most paints require you to air dry completely, then press each side of the fabric with a hot iron. "
1,"Smoking marijuana regularly before the age of 16 causes changes in the brain that can impair a young person's ability to focus, learn from mistakes and think abstractly, according to a Harvard study. On brain scans, the youngest pot smokers showed activation in regions of the brain that was not seen in those who started smoking after age 16, suggesting early exposure to marijuana causes neural changes, researchers at Harvard- affiliated McLean Hospital found. Early and habitual users performed more poorly on tests of cognitive functions, including mental flexibility. Research on how marijuana changes a developing brain is important as it's the most frequently used illegal drug in the United States, said study author Staci Gruber, the director of the neuroimaging center at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. Almost 16 percent of eighth graders have tried marijuana, and that number rises to 42 percent by 12th grade, a 2009 study from the National Institute on Drug Abuse found. Chronic, early users of marijuana 'make repetitive incorrect responses despite the fact I'm telling them they're wrong,' said Gruber, who is also an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University. 'That's called 'cognitive inflexibility' and you see it in babies.' The research, presented Monday at the Society for Neuroscience's meeting in San Diego, also found that the group that started earlier smoked more pot more often than those who started later. People who began smoking before age 16 had 25.1 smokes a week, compared with 12.1 in those who began later, the study showed. The early-onset group smoked almost three times as many grams a week, Gruber said. The study compared 33 marijuana smokers to 26 healthy controls. Participants were given a battery of tests designed to measure executive function, a term for brain processes responsible for abilities and behaviors involving abstract thinking, decision making, cognitive flexibility and correcting mistakes. The results showed those who started using marijuana before age 16 made twice as many mistakes on tests of executive function than those who began later. The research didn't examine those people who had started smoking early and stopped, although those people begin to look more like non-smokers in other studies, Gruber said. 'The developing brain is vulnerable,' Gruber said. 'If you were to legalize it, you need to keep in mind marijuana is not entirely benign. Regulations and guidelines are needed anyway given the sheer number of Americans using it.' California voters earlier this month rejected a ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana for personal use. "
1,"BERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the Group of 20 to do more to tighten financial-market regulation, while playing down their differences over how fast to reduce government debt. Merkel and Sarkozy, speaking after talks in Berlin Monday, said they are sending a joint letter to the current head of the G-20, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to press for a global banking levy and a financial transaction tax at the summit of industrial and emerging nations in Toronto June 26-27. 'We're not yet satisfied with what's been achieved since the first G-20 and we think that we have to forge ahead on regulation,' Merkel said. It's the second letter in five days from Sarkozy and Merkel, after they urged the European Union to speed up curbs on speculation, saying some bets against stocks and government bonds should be banned. The leaders of Europe's two biggest economies made a show of unity after a planned meeting on June 7 was canceled at the last minute, prompting reports of a Franco-German dispute over budget savings of more than $98 billion announced by Merkel the same day. Sarkozy, responding to a question about his differences with the chancellor, said that while he and Merkel have 'boisterous' talks at time, it's because they both want a thorough debate of all policy options. 'We are quite frank people who have ambitions,' he said. 'We do not shun problems.' Euro-area countries are cutting budgets to avoid a spread of the sovereign debt crisis emanating from Greece. A nearly $919 billion EU rescue fund has so far failed to stem the slide, with the euro falling to a four-year low against the U.S. dollar and more than $4 trillion wiped from global stock markets this year. Germany 'reacted very quickly' in drafting cuts, and all other euro countries need to follow suit, Norbert Barthle, the budget spokesman in parliament for Merkel's Christian Democrats, said Monday, urging France to announce more detailed budget-cutting steps. 'Greece has understood and Spain has understood, too,' Barthle said. 'We need progress from those that aren't on the way yet,' including France. Sarkozy has said he will cut France's deficit to 3 percent of economic output in 2013 from 8 percent now. That will mean about $55 billion of reductions in public spending, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said two days ago. Sarkozy said Monday that his government will announce details on revamping the state pension system on June 16, the day before EU leaders meet for a summit in Brussels. Fillon favors increasing the country's retirement age to 63 from 60, Le Journal du Dimanche reported Monday. 'I think that we've taken the right steps, and that France has important plans for budget consolidation,' Merkel said. The world 'needs a signal from Europe' on cutting debt, she said. "
1,"Support for a 'say on pay' proposal at DuPont Co. appears to be fading, with shareholders again rejected a nonbinding vote during the chemical company's annual meeting Wednesday. The proposal called on DuPont's board to adopt a policy that would allow shareholders to vote on a resolution to ratify compensation for executives. That measure, opposed by the company, received slightly less than 45 percent of the votes cast, with 55 percent of the ballots against it. The vote last year was 53 percent against, and 46 percent in favor. DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman said shareholders have a number of ways to communicate with the company and called the proposal unnecessary. Shareholders also overwhelmingly rejected a stockholder proposal calling on DuPont to amend its human rights policy and allow subsistence farmers in developing countries to save and share seeds protected by DuPont patents. Only 6 percent of the votes were cast in support of the measure. 'This particular issue is a very keen one for traditional farming communities around the world,' Sister Barbara Aires of the New Jersey-based Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth said in introducing the proposal. Aires applauded DuPont for having a human rights policy, but said the company has not done enough. Farmers have traditionally conserved seeds to ensure adequate plantings from year to year, but Aires said that the development of genetically modified seeds protected by patents has made such conservation illegal. Aires said companies such as DuPont, Monsanto and Dow Chemical are moving too quickly to push genetically engineered seeds without considering the social and cultural impact. Kullman said that DuPont has contributed to public seed banks and supports 'the farmers' rights to chose the best products for their use.' And Kullman said widespread conservation and sharing of seeds could affect the company's ability to invest money in research. 'We need to ask farmers not to replant and to protect that investment and its return,' Kullman said. DuPont reported Tuesday that net income more than doubled in the first quarter, yet Kullman said she is still not satisfied with DuPont's stock performance. DuPont shares, which were trading in the $75 range in 1999, fell 19 cents to $39.21 in afternoon trading Wednesday. 'I've been patient for 12 years, and I haven't seen a lot of results in respect to the share price,' one shareholder told Kullman. Kullman said DuPont is a diverse company that needs to perform in numerous sectors, and that it has developed 'greater clarity' in the mission for each of them. "

1,"In the basement of Paris's Louvre museum, the early line for Apple's iPad far surpassed that for entry to see the Mona Lisa. Hundreds queued up at the Apple store in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping center in the museum complex, with staff cheering every purchase, as sales outside the United States of the tablet computer began Friday. In Sydney, fans braved the chill of the Southern Hemisphere autumn to be among the first to buy the device, while in Tokyo people waited for as long as 40 hours to make a purchase. 'I tried to buy one in Seattle when I was there about 15 days ago, but they were sold out; so I decided to wait till it came to Europe,' said Julien Boidin, 28, who works for Microsoft in Paris and has an iPhone and a Macintosh computer. 'I live in Normandy and commute for four hours a day. I needed something for the train ride.' Following the sale of 1 million of the devices in less than a month of its April 3 debut in the U.S., the iPad is now available in Australia, Canada, Japan and six European countries. The maker of the iPhone and iPod, which this week became the world's most valuable technology company, has popularized a new category of computer between a smartphone and a laptop. Apple may sell 8 million iPads this year, according to Royal Bank of Canada. 'The thing with Apple is it's not just a piece of technology, it's actually the whole experience,' said Rahul Koduri, 22, an engineering student in Sydney, who arrived at 2 a.m. Thursday to be first in line. 'They just fit into your lifestyle so well. There's no other product that does it.' Apple delayed the release of iPads outside the United States after underestimating demand at home. In Europe, the iPad will be available in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Britain. Apple is betting the iPad, which starts at $618 in continental Europe -- more than the $499 it sells for in the U.S. to reflect higher value-added taxes -- will entice enough consumers willing to pay a premium over low-cost notebooks. Rivals such as Microsoft have failed to turn tablet computers into popular consumer devices. 'I don't really need it, but I want it,' said Jake Lee, a 17-year-old student, who camped overnight outside the store on London's Regent Street. 'I wanted to be one of the first people to get the iPad in the U.K.' Countries outside the U.S. are likely to account for 43 percent, or 3.5 million units, of iPad shipments this year, Mike Abramsky, an analyst at RBC in Toronto, wrote in a recent report. The U.S. will probably be the biggest market with 4.7 million units, followed by France with 805,000 and Britain, with 585,000, according to the report. The iPad has a 9.7-inch touch-screen display that lets users view books, magazines, video, play games and surf the Internet. Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs said the company sold 1 million iPads in the first 28 days, compared with the 74 days the iPhone took to reach that mark. Apple said this month that demand continues to exceed supply. 'I'm buying it for my friend in Malta because it's not available there yet,' said Isma Lanani, standing in line at the Louvre. 'He manages a hotel there, but this is for his personal use. He's Apple crazy.' Some British customers said they don't expect such a huge rush for iPads as in the U.S. 'Americans are very good at hyping these things up; perhaps British people are a bit more wary,' said Emily Dexter, 22, who works for a television production company. 'I'm not going to buy one because I can't afford it.' The iPad's first wave of reviews praised its ability to deliver digital books and video quickly, saying it measures up well against other devices, including Amazon.com.'s Kindle e-book reader. 'To all those people who don't think they need one, I just want to say, `you just wait and see,'' said Toru Iijima, a 39- year-old information technology professional in Tokyo. 'This is great for people who don't like computers. I want to get one for my grandparents and my child.'

1,"Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan torched eight NATO oil tankers and shot dead a driver Wednesday, police said, in the latest strike against supply convoys heading for Afghanistan since Pakistan shut a key border crossing to international forces last week. The attack occurred in a parking area of a roadside hotel on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province. At least eight trucks were on fire, and around a dozen others were parked nearby, senior police official Hamid Shakil said. Firefighters were trying to douse the flames. The attacks highlight the precariousness of NATO's efforts to supply troops in Afghanistan. While Pakistan is the fastest and cheapest way to get materials to forces, it is also one of the most dangerous, and fragile ties with Islamabad threw another wrench in the works when Pakistan closed the Torkham crossing in the northwest in apparent reaction to alleged NATO helicopter strikes on its territory. The U.S. has had trouble with other routes in the past: Uzbekistan evicted U.S. troops from a base that was used to ferry supplies into Afghanistan, and, last year, Kyrgyzstan threatened to do the same. At that time, Washington noted that the possibility of losing the Kyrgyz base was not terribly worrying since Pakistan was its main route anyway. The Kyrgyz government has since backed down. The tankers hit Wednesday were believed headed for a smaller Pakistani border crossing at Chaman that remains open. It was unclear who was behind the attack, but the Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for similar assaults on NATO supplies, including one before dawn Monday that killed four people. The militants claimed it was revenge for the NATO helicopter incursions. Counting Wednesday, there have been at least six attacks on the supply convoys since the Torkham closure -- four of them that were heading to that crossing and two on their way to Chaman in the southwest. The events of the last week have exposed the often-strained nature of the alliance between Pakistan and the United States. But analysts doubt it will reach a breaking point because each side is so reliant on the other. In addition to safe passage for NATO supplies, the U.S. needs Pakistan to help target Taliban and al-Qaida militants who stage cross-border attacks against foreign troops in Afghanistan. In return, Pakistan receives billions of dollars in military and civilian assistance that help keep its economy afloat. Both American and Pakistani officials have predicted the Torkham border crossing will reopen within a few days. NATO's Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen tried to reduce the tension between the two sides Monday by apologizing for last week's helicopter attack that killed Pakistani troops, saying the casualties were 'unintended' and that a joint investigation was under way. But even if the border is reopened, underlying tensions will remain in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, especially over Pakistan's unwillingness to go after Afghan Taliban militants on its territory with whom it has strong historical ties and who generally focus their attacks on Western troops, not Pakistani targets. The U.S. has responded by dramatically increasing the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal belt, carrying out 21 such attacks in September -- nearly double the previous monthly record. The U.S. has also stepped up military operations along the Afghan border, but officials in Washington said the recent NATO cross-border helicopter strikes were not a strong-arm tactic aimed at pressuring Pakistan. The officials said the U.S. did not oppose the temporary closure at Torkham because it lets Pakistan rebuke Washington in a way that plays well to the domestic Pakistani audience without seriously hampering U.S. military operations. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Since Pakistan closed Torkham, traffic has backed up at various points along the route from the southern port city of Karachi. But coalition officials say the closing has not resulted in shortages since hundreds of trucks still cross into landlocked Afghanistan each day through Pakistan and via Central Asian states. The convoys bring fuel, military vehicles, spare parts, clothing and other non-lethal supplies for foreign troops. ------ Associated Press Writer Riaz Khan in Peshawar and Anne Gearen in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.

1,"Regional powerhouse Thailand won the gold medals race at the 25th Southeast Asian Game by just three medals against a greatly improved team from Vietnam that it battled to the last moments of Friday's last day. The Thais finished with 86 golds and a total metal count of 266 at the 11-nation event, with Vietnam taking 83 and 215 medals overall. Indonesia was third with 43 golds and 170 medals. Seventy games records were set during the 12 days of competition. On the final day, the Thais and Vietnamese took two golds apiece. Vietnam won two in shooting while Thailand captured mixed doubles tennnis and women's team petanque, a French version of lawn bowls harkening back to colonial days in Indochina. Myanmar picked up two in sepak takraw, the Philippines won the men's tennis singles and Laos the men's team petanque. The games unveiled a Vietnamese team that had shown remarkable improvement since the 2007 games at which host Thailand amassed 182 golds and a total of 406 medals against Vietnam's 64 golds and 204 overall. The Thais were expected to capture more than 100 gold medals in Vientiane, but Vietnam had demonstrated at these games the benefit of large amounts of government funding for sports and improved coaching. 'They're very committed and they have taken the Southeast Asian games seriously. I am impressed,' said Malaysia's Minister of Youth and Sports Ahmad Shabery Cheek. Track coach Ho Thi Thu Tam said an example of the intensive, pre-games training was the athletics team which was sent to the southern Chinese province of Yunnan to run at altitudes of up to 1,900 meters. Four of her charges won golds at Vientiane. But in the most popular event of the games, favored Vietnam suffered an unlikely 1-0 defeat in the football final after an 84th minute own goal by Vietnam's Mai Xuan Hop handed victory to Malaysia. Hop sank to the ground and wept. Thousands of Vietnamese fans packed the 20,000-seat stadium Thursday, having poured into the Lao capital aboard planes, buses, cars and jammed into the back of open-air trucks, waving Vietnam's yellow star flag and carrying portraits of revolutionary hero Ho Chi Minh. The hosts received high marks from athletes, coaches and officials for running the games with surprising efficiency mixed with traditional Lao hospitality and a laidback style. The sporting event, staged in one of the world's poorest nations, was the biggest in the country's history and probably the largest national event since celebrations of independence from France in 1947. Vientiane's schools were closed, weddings and other large gatherings banned and the capital underwent major infrastructure clean-ups and repairs. Hundreds of high school and college student volunteers, the women dressed in sarongs, helped out at the sports venues. Largely dependent on foreign aid, Laos received assistance from China, which built the main stadium complex, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Brunei and neighboring Thailand, which provided technical assistance and personnel to help run events and train future local sports officials. The Lao teams, cheered on by avid fans, exceeded their official gold target of 25, winning 33. The 2011 games will be hosted by four cities in Indonesia -- Semarang, Bandung, Jakarta and Palembang -- and will feature competition in 38 sports including non-Olympic ones like wall climbing, roller skating, chess and the martial art of kenpo. Host nations can introduce some sports of their own choosing, and are normally ones in which they excel. It will be Indonesia's fourth time as game host. "
1,"We found our dream house. We found it just 15 miles outside the District of Columbia, in southern Prince George's County, Md. A stunning three-bedroom, two-bath contemporary on six acres of wooded land with a stream running through it, a huge deck and a swimming pool. A wall of windows brings the surrounding woods into the house. Strongly built and energy-efficient, it sailed through inspection. It was perfect for us, a commuting couple with jobs in New York and Washington. And the price? Less than a Manhattan studio. But our efforts to buy the house revealed a dimension of the housing market many people probably don't see. Much of the recent news about the housing market has concerned massive foreclosures. But banks are scrutinizing much more than would- be buyers' financial shape. They're worried about other shapes, too. We were pre-qualified for a loan; with two professional incomes, good credit and enough cash for a 20 percent down payment, that would not be our problem. Yet two mortgage companies turned us down. The first did so after its investors - big banks with household names - rejected our application. The second mortgage company's internal underwriters also rejected us. Their reasons were the same: The home, a customized modular house of internationally acclaimed design, built in 1989, is . . . round. Being 'unusual' or 'unique,' it was deemed 'not marketable.' Despite its evident worth and multiple independent appraisals, the lenders said they could not assign a value to the house because there were no comparable properties. And, with no 'value,' there was insufficient collateral for a loan. In fact, round is what we loved about this house. There are hundreds of colonials, ramblers and McMansions on the market, many of them short sales and foreclosures. We wanted something different. The mortgage industry apparently only wants us to buy what everyone else has (or had). The two mortgage lenders didn't consider us a risk; rather, the risk was the design of the house itself. They believe that if we defaulted on our payments, they would not be able to resell the house. There is a certain perversity about making a house unbuyable, even to two eager would-be purchasers, for fear of it being unsellable in the future. This is how far the pendulum has swung. Two years ago, banks were approving balloon mortgages for people who made little or no down payment and whose ability to pay was questionable. Now they have gone beyond being more cautious about borrowers' income and assets to being skittish about even the shape of a house. We're disappointed. But we also are struck by the irony, during a recession and in an area with a depressed housing market and a shrinking property-tax base, of financially well-qualified and willing buyers being turned away simply because a property is 'unique.' Lenders are making overly conservative decisions based on fuzzy logic and blinkered, formulaic reasoning. In so doing, they discourage the market from recovery. And the house sits unsold, our dreams denied. _ _ _ Mae M. Ngai is a professor of history in New York. John G. New is an attorney in Washington. "
1,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has told his military to be combat-ready in a message that coincided with South Korea's announcement that it blamed his regime for the sinking of a warship, a dissident group says. Kim's order was broadcast on May 20 by O Kuk Ryol, vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, according to the website of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a Seoul-based group run by defectors from the communist country. The Korean won weakened 3 percent against the dollar and the Kospi stock index dropped to the lowest in more than three months. The report added to perceptions of increased tension on the Korean peninsula following the March 26 sinking of the 1,200 ton Cheonan, with the loss of 46 lives. South Korea Monday announced plans for joint military exercises with the United States off the west coast where the ship sank, while North Korea Tuesday warned of military action in the area after accusing the South of violating its territory in the disputed zone. 'For Kim Jong Il to be giving such an order is pretty serious,' said Kim Yong Hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Seoul-based Dongguk University, adding that he doubted that such a direct order was given. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that China understands the gravity of escalating tensions with North Korea. 'We expect to be working together with China in responding to North Korea's provocative action and promoting stability in the region,' Clinton told reporters in Beijing at the end of two days of talks with Chinese leaders. 'We pledged to stay in very close consultation.' Clinton said her discussions in Beijing about North Korea had been 'very frank and detailed.' China has yet to publicly accept the finding of an international panel, which concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the warship. 'We do not agree on every issue, we don't agree even sometimes on the perception of an issue, but that is partly what this dialogue is about,' Clinton said, adding that this enabled the discussion to include areas of discord including missile sales to Taiwan and human rights. While Kim doesn't want war, North Korea is ready to counter any attacks, O said in the message, according to the dissident group, which cited an unidentified person in the country. The organization was among the first in South Korea to report on North Korea's botched currency revaluation late last year. Defectors formed North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity in 2008. It has about 250 members and is led by a former computer-science teacher in the communist country. Threats of war by North Korea carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency are commonplace. A March 26 report warned of 'unprecedented nuclear strikes' against enemies while a June 9, 2009 bulletin warned of 'merciless strikes' using the country's nuclear deterrent. Lee Jong Joo, a spokeswoman at the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said she couldn't confirm the defectors' report as the closed-circuit radio, on which the message was said to be delivered, cannot be monitored by South Korea's government. A spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry, who declined to be identified, said the government can't comment on North Korea's military status. The won fell 3 percent to 1,251.1 per dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, the biggest drop since March 30, 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kospi index sank 2.8 percent to 1,560.83. Tensions heightened on the Korean peninsula following last week's report by a South Korean-led multinational panel that North Korea was the 'only plausible' perpetrator of the attack. 'If South Korea continues to trespass our waters we will carry out real military action to protect our territory,' KCNA reported Tuesday. North Korea's military sent the warning in a message to South Korea today, the agency said. North Korea said it would shell South Korean positions that tried to blare propaganda over the demilitarized zone that marks the border between the two countries, which are still formally at war following their 1950-1953 conflict. The border is one of the most heavily armed in the world, with U.S. and South Korean troops facing off against North Korea's million-strong army. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: WASHINGTON _ During his first year in office, President Obama has been commendably available to take reporters' questions. Indeed, there has been some sniping about whether the president has been overexposed. According to figures compiled by Towson University political scientist Martha Joynt Kumar, in the first seven months of his presidency, George W. Bush held just three full- fledged news conferences in which he appeared solo before reporters and 11 joint appearances (brief sessions with foreign leaders). In that same period, Obama held nine solo and 13 joint sessions; he gave 114 interviews to Bush's 37. So Obama has been doing great in comparison _ until recently. The president has not taken questions from reporters since Dec. 18 in Copenhagen; his last real news conference was in Italy during the economic summit. The issue of presidential availability for questioning is especially salient in the wake of the failed Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253. Mr. Obama has made numerous statements about the incident. He has not taken a single question. His homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, and counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, briefed reporters after the president's remarks on Thursday. But there are important questions that call for a presidential response on this serious matter. Asked Friday about this situation, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the White House had no plans for a news conference. At a jobs event Friday, the president took no questions from reporters. This presidential reticence is unfortunate. The American people are understandably concerned about the intelligence failings that Mr. Obama outlined. They want to hear from him beyond canned statements. In his dealings with reporters, the president has proven himself knowledgeable and adept at offering thoughtful responses. It is puzzling, and disturbing, that he would choose not to answer questions about one of the biggest events of his young presidency. Washington Post-Bloomberg News Service "
1,"Eight of the 41 players on the roster of the University of Virginia men's lacrosse team, including George Huguely, have been charged with alcohol-related offenses during their careers at the school, court records show. A ninth was charged with underage possession of alcohol, but it is unclear whether he was a university student at the time of the offense. The charges include underage alcohol possession, using a fake ID and driving while intoxicated. Some of the players were found not guilty; six were convicted or pleaded guilty. Together, they make up 22 percent of the current men's lacrosse team. One served two days in jail with 88 days suspended, and another was sentenced to more than six months in jail but appealed. The resolution of that sentence is unclear. Huguely's arrest Monday in the death of Yeardley Love, a classmate and fellow lacrosse player, has focused public scrutiny on the school's lacrosse program. The pair, both 22, had dated for months, but Love broke off the relationship in recent weeks, friends and a relative have said. Love was found dead in her bed in her apartment near campus. Huguely told police he shook her during a violent argument before her death, hitting her head repeatedly against a wall, according to affidavits filed by police in support of a search warrant. Huguely's attorney has said Love's death was a tragic accident. Huguely had previously pleaded guilty to resisting arrest, public swearing and public intoxication after a drunken scuffle with a female Virginia police officer during a November 2008 visit to Lexington, Va. In the November 2008 incident, Huguely told the arresting officer, 'I'll kill you. I'll kill all of y'all. I'm not going to jail,' the officer said. She said his diatribe was laced with racial, sexual and other vulgar terms. She used a Taser to subdue him. Huguely received a 60-day suspended sentence, six months' supervised probation and a fine, according to court records. He was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service and 20 hours of substance abuse education, which he finished in July, the records show. His arrest and the others come on a team that, according to students, has a reputation for hard partying. It also has a strict alcohol policy. In 1999, Coach Dom Starsia adopted a policy that allowed players to drink only one night a week, usually Saturdays. A player who broke the rule once would be suspended indefinitely. The second time, he'd be dismissed from the team. 'Alcohol and lacrosse have gone hand-in-hand since my days at Brown in the 1970s,' Starsia told The Washington Post at the time. 'Whether it is postgame celebrations or just in general, there was something about the sport and alcohol, and Virginia was no different. I always thought alcohol was an issue here, and it is something we talked about before the season began.' In 2004, Starsia suspended several players for violating the team's alcohol policy. Court documents also show that police have recovered a University of Virginia lacrosse T-shirt, stained red, from Huguely's apartment. They also found a letter from Huguely addressed to Love, his former girlfriend, according to an account on the Web site of the Charlottesville Daily Progress. Huguely hails from a well-known, affluent Washington family. Love was raised on an estate in the suburbs north of Baltimore. Both attended private preparatory schools. Both lacrosse players, they met as University of Virginia students. Documents filed Wednesday in Charlottesville General District Court show the results of a search of Huguely's apartment Monday afternoon, according to the article: two white Apple laptops, a green spiral notebook, two white socks, a bathroom rug, a shower curtain, an entryway rug and a pair of blue cargo shorts. Investigators also attempted to lift DNA samples from a bathtub, the kitchen, a trash can and the front door. Huguely told police he took Love's computer from her bedroom, according to investigative documents. Police have since recovered it. Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said Wednesday the autopsy on Love was completed Tuesday but it will be several weeks before police receive written findings. 'At that time we will review with the prosecutor and decide what, if anything, we will release,' Longo said. He said his department may defer to the state medical examiner regarding any information release at that point. More details emerged Wednesday about the relationship between Love and Huguely, which lasted more than a year and ended within weeks of her death, according to loved ones. A family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Love told him in a March conversation that Huguely 'was aggressive. But she said nothing more. I didn't think anything of it.' "
1,"Ask David Plouffe how Democrats can recover from their electoral setbacks over the past few months and he has a simple answer: Republicans. 'Politics is a comparative exercise,' Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama's presidential campaign, told the Fix in his first extended interview since he took on a broadened political role for the White House in advance of the midterm elections. 'This isn't just a referendum on Democrats or our party. It's a choice.' That choice was made explicit far too late in last month's special Senate election in Massachusetts between then-state Sen. Scott Brown, R, and state Attorney General Martha Coakley, D, Plouffe noted. 'Everyone would agree that the definition of Brown should have happened a lot sooner and a lot more clearly,' he said. The Democratic defeat served as something of a wake-up call for the White House, making clear the need to step up its efforts to effectively monitor what is expected to be a large playing field this fall. Plouffe had remained an adviser to Obama after the campaign, although not in any formal capacity. Now his job will be to help ensure that the White House and the Democratic National Committee do everything possible to get Democrats elected this fall. While the White House announcement about Plouffe drew lots of media attention, especially in light of the devastating loss in Massachusetts, Plouffe said that his new role has been 'completely overstated.' He said that the 'notion that any individual or the White House has become the czar of all campaigns is not grounded in reality.' What is clear, however, is that Plouffe has been assigned to apply his meticulous, detail-oriented approach to competitive races across the country, ensuring that the White House and the DNC do everything they can to sniff out problems and offer solutions _ and not be surprised by another Scott Brown. Plouffe, citing his experience as a campaign manager, was quick to note that the 'campaigns themselves are going to be the major actors in whether they win or lose.' He said he hopes that the White House and DNC can help 'on the margins.' 'My guess is you are going to have a lot of races decided on the margins,' he added. Though Plouffe insisted that each campaign will be unique, it is clear he feels strongly that Democrats have done a poor job to date in drawing contrasts with Republicans and making sure that voters know what a GOP majority in the House or Senate would mean for the direction of the country. 'Republicans right now are just sitting back and slinging arrows,' Plouffe explained. 'We need to infiltrate their camp and shine some light over their side of the fence.' How does Plouffe frame the argument to voters? He says that Democrats have spent the past two years trying to fix problems while Republicans are asking voters for the chance to wheel a 'Trojan horse' into Washington _ out of which will spill bankers and health insurance executives. Bayh weak? Some troubling news for Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind.? Maybe. A poll conducted for the National Republican Senatorial Committee shows that the two-term senator may be vulnerable to a challenge _ presumably from former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., _ largely because of voter dissatisfaction with the Democratic health-care legislation and the flight of independents from the Democratic Party. The survey, which was conducted by GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, showed that six in 10 Indiana voters oppose the health-care plan, while 32 percent support it. And the opposition to the legislation is passionate _ 48 percent said they strongly opposed the measure passed by the Senate. Independents, who voted heavily for Obama and helped him shock the political world by carrying the Hoosier State in 2008, have swung in the opposite direction in the Conway poll; 40 percent said they would vote for an unnamed Republican candidate for office, while just 19 percent chose an unnamed Democrat. Like all polls commissioned by a political party, this one should be taken with a grain of salt. And not all the numbers in it are bad for Bayh. Fifty-two percent of Indiana voters feel favorably toward him, while just 32 percent feel unfavorably _ solid numbers for any incumbent in a year like this one. Perhaps most important, elections are not conducted between two generic candidates. While Conway concludes that 'a credible candidate willing to run against Washington' is the right profile to beat Bayh, it's not clear that Coats, who is a lobbyist, fits that bill. "
1,"The Obama administration has replaced the Minerals Management Service, faulted for lax regulation of offshore drilling before the BP spill last month, with three offices to oversee leases, drilling safety and fee collection. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar signed an order Wednesday creating the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. President Barack Obama said on May 15 that he would end the 'cozy relationship' between companies that drill for oil and gas and the Minerals Management Service, part of the Interior Department. Its track record has been scrutinized since the BP well blew up on April 20, killing 11 workers and creating an oil spill that continues to spread toward Gulf Coast states from Louisiana to Florida. 'Theses three missions -- energy development, enforcement and revenue collection -- are conflicting missions and must be separated,' Salazar said on a conference call with reporters. 'So today I'm ordering the division of MMS into three distinct entities.' The MMS generates about $13 billion a year by working with companies such as BP and Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop oil and natural gas, trailing only the Internal Revenue Service in revenue. 'The same group of people, the same agency getting that $13 billion are also for doing everything else,' Salazar said. 'It's from my point of view an important organizational change.' Lawmakers from both parties have questioned the MMS's ability to enforce safety and environmental regulations at the same time it promotes energy development. The agency, created in 1982, is too close to the companies it regulates, said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. The relationship discouraged the MMS from demanding better systems to prevent well blowouts like the one spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, Issa said. Lawmakers also have questioned the government's enforcement of safety standards and regulations to ensure that companies can respond effectively after spills. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she was 'stunned' to learn that chemical dispersants used to break up oil as it flows from a well weren't tested before the BP explosion. 'We probably lost days here,' Murkowski said at a May 11 hearing. 'It's more than just a little bit frustrating.' Lamar McKay, chairman of BP America, told a House panel Wednesday the company would use all available resources to stop the gushing well and clean up the Gulf and shoreline. Measures to stop the flow of oil so far have been only partially successful. The new safety office will employ about 300 people, Salazar said in a statement May 11 when he announced his intention to overhaul MMS. The Interior secretary said he will seek an additional $29 million from Congress for rig inspections and enforcement, including $20 million for examination of oil- drilling platforms in coastal waters.

1,"Australia coach Robbie Deans has returned to New Zealand following the death of his father and will miss most of the Wallabies' training week in South Africa ahead of a Tri-Nations match. The Wallabies left for Cape Town on Friday, but Deans instead flew to Christchurch. He is not expected to rejoin the team in South Africa until at least Wednesday. Anthony (Tony) Maxwell Deans died Friday at the age of 83. He is survived by his wife, Joh, and four other children. Assistant coaches Jim Williams and Richard Graham will take charge of Australia's training sessions until Deans returns, Australian Associated Press reported from Cape Town. The Wallabies had a training-free day Saturday to recover from the 19-hour flight from Australia. The squad planned to watch the South Africa-All Blacks Tri-Nations match later Saturday before holding its first training session Sunday. The Wallabies broke an eight-year test-match losing streak in South Africa last year with a 27-15 victory in Durban, but were thumped 53-8 the following week in Johannesburg. Australia has not won at Cape Town's Newlands ground, where the teams meet next Saturday, since 1992. "

1,"SpongeBob SquarePants and his friends in Bikini Bottom have a message for the BP contractors, cleanup crews and news media that have descended on this small beach town where oil washes up almost daily. 'Seriously ... When Can We GO BACK IN THE WATER?' they ask in a painting, staked on the side of the main road, that shows oil marring the ocean. If you want to know how residents here feel about the oil spill, just read the signs posted on seemingly every electrical pole, planted in front yards or along the roads. Some are funny, like the six-painting SpongeBob series or the old toilet labeled 'BP Headquarters.' Some are angry: 'Cannot fish or swim. How the hell are we suppose (sic) to feed our kids now?' Water is the center of life in Grand Isle, an eight-mile scrap of land standing between Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico that has been hard hit by the oil spill that followed the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig nearly three months ago. BP has dispatched hordes of contractors to the island to clean up the beaches and skim oil off the waters, and the TV cameras have followed. The signs are the handiwork of a feisty population that feels there is little else they can do to keep their culture and industry alive. Many cannot work because commercial fishing waters are closed, and they cannot play because the beaches are lined with miles of orange tiger boom to keep the oil at bay. That means there is plenty of time to brainstorm new signs. 'I had to scream for help some kind of way,' said Bobby Pitre, who crafted one of the most jarring displays. 'It was like an SOS to the world.' Pitre created statues of a father and his little girl, cowering in fear, wearing oil-stained clothes and gas masks and holding a sign that says 'God help us all.' He placed them in front of his tattoo parlor, Southern Sting. Soon, folks were stopping to take photos. That inspired Pitre and his friend and co-worker, Eric Guidry, to paint murals along the front wall of the shop. They re-created the famous Obama 'hope' poster and covered it with question marks and the words, 'What Now?' They painted a water tower that now holds oil. And for a final touch, they turned a mannequin into a bloody torso and attached it to a billboard: 'BP took our arms. The government is taking our legs. How will we stand?' Pitre said the sign is a reference to commercial fishing closures and the deepwater drilling moratorium that have decimated the local economy. 'Those are the two things we thrive off of,' Pitre said. 'We really needed to get people's attention.' Perhaps this is just a region that wears its heart on its billboards. There are all manner of homemade signs along the winding state highways here. One spray- painted sign warns drivers that 'U-turners will be shot at'; another features the graduation photo of a newly minted lawyer with congratulatory messages. Several newer signs take aim at residents who have rented their homes _ they call them camps _ to BP contractors working on the cleanup. 'It's all about greed,' one sign says. 'Your (sic) not renting your camp, your (sic) destroying your community.' Grand Isle Mayor David Camardelle said the signs express the frustration that many residents feel with the pace of the cleanup and the flood of newcomers. 'They're afraid that all these contractors coming in, they don't know nobody,' he said. 'We're born and raised on this island. We leave our windows open, our keys in the car. The neighbors know each other. ... It's not bad people, it's just a change of life.' Darleen Taylor is one of the roughly 1,400 full-time residents of Grand Isle. The oil spill put her four brothers out of work as fishermen, so they joined BP's cleanup crew. They try to laugh at their misery _ which is how they started talking about SpongeBob. Taylor said they were making a family dinner when one brother mentioned it would be funny if Patrick, the starfish who is SpongeBob's sidekick, mistook the oil for chocolate. He said he would put it in his front yard if she painted it. That became the first of six oily SpongeBob signs now on roadside display. Taylor used to paint scenes of cypress trees and egrets until Hurricane Katrina destroyed her home five years ago. She hasn't painted a single thing until now. Taylor sets up her brush and canvas on the back porch of her rebuilt home. It's quiet here, and she can see the marsh and Elmer's Island. The oil is barely visible, she said. Four more SpongeBob paintings are in the works. 'They all wait every weekend to see what's next,' Taylor said. "
1,"In the curious annals of congressional drama, this week's debate on the fate of New York Rep. Charles Rangel will be odder than most. The House will agonize, and Rangel will emote, over this question: Will Rangel - who has been found guilty of 11 ethics violations - be scolded in person, or will he be scolded in writing? That's all. The first option is called a censure. The second, which Rangel (D) very much prefers, is a reprimand. Neither would kick Rangel out of Congress, dock his pay, take away his right to vote - or in any other way prevent him from being the exact same congressman he is today. So why does it matter? The reason has to do with the way congressmen view themselves: In an era when politicians routinely compare their opponents to Hitler, socialists and Dr. Kevorkian, the House still sees its chamber as an island of 19th-century decorum. It is a place, at least in theory, where an old-fashioned scolding still carries an awful sting. 'Even in this age where politics has become so polarized and nationalized, Congress is still in many ways a small community. Censure really is shaming, just like shaming in any small community,' said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT. 'If you're somebody like Rangel, who has made a career mastering that place, to be basically stripped naked and scolded, that really is a traumatic thing.' That much became clear this month when a House ethics panel considered Rangel's case. The congressman walked out in protest and later made tearful appeals, asking colleagues to remember that he was not a crook. 'I thank you for this awkward opportunity to express myself. And I apologize for any embarrassment I've caused you individually or collectively as a member of the greatest institution in the country and the world,' Rangel, 80, told the House ethics committee Nov. 18, just before members voted on his fate. Nonetheless, the committee recommended censure. Members found that Rangel had improperly used his congressional staff and official letterhead to solicit donations from corporate charities and chief executives for a college wing named in his honor at City College of New York. The ethics committee also found that Rangel, onetime chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, did not pay taxes on a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic and did not properly disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal financial assets. Additionally, it found that Rangel violated New York City rules by housing his political committees in rent-controlled apartments in Harlem. Now, the full House is set to vote, perhaps Tuesday. The procedure will be simple: Rangel will have a chance to speak in his defense, and then members will vote. If the House decides on a reprimand, then the written reproof would be placed in the congressional record. But if the House votes to censure him, Rangel would be forced to take part in a brief but powerful ritual of personal humiliation. He would have to walk to the front of the House chamber, to the 'well' where members typically stand to speak. Then, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would read aloud a one-paragraph resolution of censure. That would last about 30 seconds. Then Rangel would be free to go. (Such cases have not always resulted in easy departures. In 1921, after hearing his own censure, Rep. Thomas L. Blanton, D-Texas, fled the House chamber and collapsed, striking his head on the marble floor in a Capitol corridor.) No matter the outcome, the vote will be a rare moment in Washington. About 11,000 people have served in the House since 1789, but only 35 have been punished by a vote of their colleagues. The full Senate has punished 24 members. It's not that Congress is filled with a bunch of saints; it's that most members under investigation have resigned, retired or lost re-election bids before their cases came to a vote. Twenty-two House members have been censured. Their violations have included bribery, assaulting other members and sexual misconduct. Rangel's argument is that he does not deserve to be lumped in with that lot. 'Rep. Rangel has not been convicted with any crime,' his staffers wrote in a memo that has been circulated to other legislators. 'In the past, the ethics committee has recommended a reprimand [instead of censure] in matters where a member has failed to submit accurate financial disclosure statements, or intentionally failed to disclose gifts or donations.' Rangel will ask the House to add him to the list of nine members who have been given reprimands. One, Charles Wilson, D-Calif., had the distinction of being given both a reprimand (1978) and a censure (1980). The reprimand, first used in 1976, has typically been handed out for lesser offenses. The most recent one, according to the Congressional Research Service, was handed in September 2009 to Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., for shouting 'You lie!' at President Barack Obama during the president's speech to a joint session of Congress. Reps. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Jo Bonner, R-Ala., chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the ethics committee, said that Rangel's position as Ways and Means chairman meant he ought to be held to a higher standard. 'The committee concluded that the 11 violations committed by Representative Rangel on a continuous and prolonged basis were more serious in character, meriting a strong congressional response rebuking his behavior,' Lofgren and Bonner wrote in a committee report. The ritual of censure takes its power from the contrast between the words and the place, said Melanie Sloan, with the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. In the House chamber, she said, 'you're supposed to avoid even offensive words or any effort to cause anybody offense on the floor. And this in many ways is the opposite of that.' She said she hoped that Rangel would resign before facing such a punishment. 'It's intended to cause the member humiliation and embarrassment. That's the very point of the exercise,' Sloan said. Rangel remains popular in his district. Constituents reelected him for a 21st term this month with 80 percent of the vote. And, despite their power to scare, historians say that neither censure nor reprimand is an automatic political death sentence. The last three House members reprimanded are still in politics - current members Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Wilson, and former member Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. The last two House members to be censured were Daniel B. Crane, R-Ill., and Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., each disciplined in 1983 for having sex with teenage House pages in separate incidents. Crane lost re-election and returned to his dental practice in Illinois. Studds was re-elected and served until 1997. 'You can't really say, 'This is what happens after . . . you're censured,' ' said John Lapinski, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'We only have so many cases to look at. And so many of them are from so long ago.' "
1,"Mathieu Debuchy's winner in stoppage time gave Lille a 3-2 victory over champion Marseille in the French league on Saturday and improved his team's chances of securing a Champions League spot. Marseille clinched its ninth league title in the previous round on Wednesday and tops the standings with an unbeatable 75 points, five clear of Lille. Auxerre was third with 68, followed by Lyon with 66. Elsewhere, it was: Auxerre 0, Lens 0; Valenciennes 2, Lyon 2; Montpellier 2, Lorient 1; Bordeaux 2, Sochaux 0; Rennes 2, Nice 2; Monaco 2, Nancy 1; Le Mans 1, Paris Saint-Germain 0; Saint-Etienne 0, Toulouse 1; Grenoble 2, Boulogne 0. Mamadou Niang curled home a shot from the edge of the box to become the top striker in the league with 17 goals and put Marseille ahead after six minutes. But Marseille was reduced to 10 men in the 26th when goalkeeper Steve Mandanda was sent off for tripping Ivory Coast forward Gervinho, who was clean through on goal. Yohan Cabaye sent Elinton Andrade the wrong way to notch his 13th goal this season and level for Lille. Marseille recaptured the lead on the stroke of halftime when Vitorino Hilton buried home a rebound after a header from Benoit Cheyrou had been cleared off the goal line. But Tulio de Melo headed in a cross from Ludovic Obraniak to equalize in the 80th before Debuchy nodded home a corner in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Lille earned its fifth straight win to consolidate second place. "

1,"The great hope a few months ago was for a 'recovery summer,' with the economy responding favorably to various policy initiatives. Yet the recovery has lost momentum, and while the end of the year will not be as gut-wrenching as the final 3 1/2 months of 2008, when the global economy suffered a cardiac arrest, it will be as consequential in affecting the welfare of millions of people. Throughout the summer, data signals have become more alarming. Despite all the rhetoric about job creation, unemployment remains stubbornly high and the problem is becoming structural in nature (and, therefore, harder to solve). Consumer credit continues to contract while small companies find it difficult to access new bank lines of credit. Housing activity is falling, and home values are poised for further declines as foreclosures increase. The trade balance has taken an ominous turn, with exports stagnating and imports surging. More Americans are falling through the large holes in the country's safety net. The equity markets are again under pressure while yields on Treasury bonds have collapsed, reflecting that market's growing concerns about the weak economic outlook. With such fragility, households and companies have become even more cautious, undermining the 'animal spirits' needed for economic expansion. Meanwhile, the United States has received little help from the rest of the world. Yes, German growth is up, but a significant part reflects its well- functioning export machine. The beneficial spillover effects have been immaterial. And despite the political narrative to the contrary, market concerns with debt solvency in some eurozone countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) remain high. Even a steadily growing China is proving to be of limited help. While Beijing is implementing additional structural changes to reorient its economy toward domestic consumption, the pace remains measured; what is understandable from a Chinese national perspective does little to help sustainably rebalance the global economy. In sum, the current policy approaches here and abroad are unlikely to deliver a durable and robust U.S. recovery and, critically, create sufficient growth in jobs. Yet the main debate in Washington is whether to do more of the same _ namely, another fiscal stimulus and another round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. This clearly conflicts with evidence that a broader and more holistic response is needed. These realities will fuel debate among economists, who already hold unusually divergent views, and reignite the discomforting notion that economic unthinkables and improbables _ such as a double-dip recession and a deflation trap _ are more of a possibility. What is critical to keep in mind is that this situation is part of a broad, multiyear process driven by national and global realignments. It's a secular phenomenon that needs to be better understood and navigated _ by recognizing its structural dimensions and by urgently broadening the excessively cyclical policy mindsets that abound. Unfortunately, the approach in too many industrial countries has been to kick the can down the road, seemingly hoping for a series of immaculate economic recoveries. Policymakers must break this active inertia by implementing a structural vision to accompany their current cyclical focus. Measures are needed to address key issues, which include the change in drivers of growth and employment creation; the high risk of skill erosion and lost labor productivity; financial deleveraging in the private sector; debt overhangs; the uncertain regulatory environment; and the unacceptably high risks facing the most vulnerable segments of society. Specific measures would include pro-growth tax reform, housing finance reform, increased infrastructure investments, greater support for education and research, job retraining programs, removal of outdated interstate competition barriers and stronger social safety nets. That, of course, is what is desirable; how about what is likely? With the recovery's visible loss in momentum, more people are coming to appreciate the importance of structural issues. Indeed, some elements of the package are visible. Yet, to my dismay, the prospects for a sufficiently bold policy reaction are doubtful. Post-financial crisis, it is no longer just about the 'unusually uncertain' economic outlook and related challenges for a policy approach that remains too reactive and ad hoc. The politics of structural change are now a material impediment. An already polarized political environment is becoming even more fractured by real and far less substantive issues. There is virtually no political center that can anchor consensus and enable sustained implementation of policy. Meanwhile, as anti-Washington sentiments rise, interest in a national agenda is increasingly giving way to the election cycle. Internationally, the impressive degree of cross-border coordination seen during the global financial crisis has been reduced to inconsistent _ and at times contradictory _ national responses. This worrisome trio of increasingly ineffective national and global policy stances, intense political polarization and growing social pressures speaks to the risk that the economy's recent soft patch will evolve into something even more troublesome and sinister. I hope that sober policy responses will accompany the coming cooler temperatures. Given the proximity of the November elections, however, I worry they may not. Mohamed A.

1,"Even the nicest and most caring religious people are often unaware of quite how rude they are being. For example, it's extremely impolite to ask me how, if I don't believe in your personal god, I can possibly have any sense of morality. And it's also rather presumptuous, as well as illogical, to suggest that, now that I know of a nasty change in my physical condition, it's surely time for me to be thinking of an alteration in my mental and intellectual state as well. Leaving aside those who have thanked god for giving me cancer and a future in the eternal inferno, the offer of prayer can only have two implications: either a wish for my recovery or a wish for a reconsideration of my atheism (or both). In the first instance, a get-well card - accompanied by a good book or a fine bottle - would be just as bracing if not indeed more so. In the second one, a clear suggestion is present: surely now, at last, Hitchens, your fears will begin to vanquish your reason. What a thing to hope for! Yet without this parody of concern, religion would instantly lose a vast portion of its power. If I was to be wrong about this, then the faithful would have been praying for me to see the light when I was not dying. But this they mostly did not choose to do. The deity whose intercession is being implored is claimed to be omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. It is fully aware of the situation. It can make me a believer if it chooses, or wave away my carcinoma. Why should it be swayed by the entreaties of other sinners? My provisional conclusion is that those who practice incantations are doing so as much for their sake as mine: no harm in that to be sure and likely to produce just as much of a result. Writer Christoper Hitchens contributed this to the On Faith blog at www.washingtonpost.com, which is featuring a week long video series with Hitchens about his diagnosis and his beliefs. "
1,"NEW YORK - Stocks advanced for a fifth straight day Friday, capping a five-week rally in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, as faster-than-forecast employment growth bolstered optimism about the economy. The S&P 500 added 0.4 percent to a two-year high of 1,225.85, as the government said payrolls climbed 151,000 in October. The benchmark index rose every day this week, the first time that's happened during a five-day week since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 9.24 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,444.08. 'It's a mistake to be bearish here,' said Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 'I don't think the economy is as weak as all the talking heads have been indicating. The jobs report was better than expected. Profits are going to continue to be good. Any correction in stocks will be short and shallow.' The S&P 500 ended the week with a gain of 3.6 percent, its fifth straight weekly advance and the longest rally since April, as the Fed announced plans to buy $600 billion in bonds and elections produced a divided Congress that's unlikely to pass further business reforms. Futures erased an earlier drop as the increase in payrolls reported by the Labor Department beat all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, following a revised 41,000 drop the prior month that was smaller than initially estimated. Private payrolls that exclude government agencies also gained more than forecast, while the jobless rate held at 9.6 percent. 'It's a strong jobs report,' said Barry Knapp, chief U.S. equity strategist at Barclays in New York. 'Those figures taken in conjunction with everything else we've seen this week set a very positive backdrop for the equity market.' The Citigroup Economic Surprise index for the U.S., which gauges the rate at which economic data is exceeding or trailing economists' estimates, has risen for 11 straight days and turned positive on Oct. 29. Its gain in the last month is the biggest in its history going back to 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A measure of financial companies jumped 2.1 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among 10 industries. JPMorgan rose 2.9 percent to $40.94. Wells Fargo added 6.4 percent to $29.22. 'It now looks highly likely that the dividends for a number of banks will be increased,' Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove, who is based in Lutz, Fla., said in a telephone interview. 'Do they have the capacity to dramatically increase their dividends? The answer is definitely yes. They have enormous capacity to increase their earnings from a balance sheet standpoint.' Massey surged 11 percent to $46.94. The Wall Street Journal said the company is weighing a takeover offer from Alpha Natural Resources. Massey, the largest coal producer in Central Appalachia, has plunged 14 percent since an April 5 blast at the operation near Montcoal, W.Va., which was the worst U.S. coal mining accident in 40 years. Starbucks rose 3.8 percent to $30.87. The world's largest coffee shop operator posted adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share, exceeding the average of analysts' estimates by 5 cents on higher foot traffic and Via instant coffee sales. Kraft Foods fell 2.2 percent to $31.08. The world's second-largest food company that bought Cadbury in February posted third-quarter sales of $11.86 billion, missing the average analyst estimate by 1.1 percent. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's attempt to boost U.S. economic growth helped send stocks to the highest level since 2008 and has broken the correlation between stocks and bonds, according to Bloomberg data. 'That correlation is breaking down because you've got a third party, i.e. the Fed, manipulating the Treasury market,' said Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer at Greenwood, S.C.-based Greenwood Capital. 'What you should see in a recovery is yields going up and stock prices going up at the same time.' With assistance from Whitney Kisling and Lu Wang in New York. "
1,"It seems everyone who spends time around Sun Valley has stories to tell of celebrity encounters. They stood in line at the bookstore last week behind rocker Bruce Springsteen, or at Tully's Coffee the other day with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. They performed in community theater with actor Bruce Willis in neighboring Hailey or introduced themselves to television personality and producer Larry David at Dollar Mountain, one of the two ski areas that comprise the fabled 74-year-old resort. 'You see movie stars, and it just doesn't mean much after a while,' said Bill Smith, a longtime Hailey resident. 'They just come and go, and most of them are very nice.' Hollywood potentates, skiing and a strong pride in local history merge seamlessly in this string of small communities in the northern Rocky Mountains. Sun Valley is a city of its own that includes a large resort and hotel complex. But the name is used often by visitors to describe the entire resort area of the Wood River Valley, including the cities of Hailey and Ketchum, a dozen miles apart. The cultural and natural elements of this stunning valley form a complex realm that includes farmers, artists and local businesses, small local music festivals and large private jets, many dozens of great restaurants and a backdrop of towering mountains. The Sun Valley Resort, near Ketchum, has upscale lodging for 1,200 in its main lodge building, an inn, and condos, apartments and houses within walking distance of the lodge's heated pools and skating rink. The lodge has an unusual old-world charm heightened by its tall evergreens and abundance of snow. It is the kind of place where a visitor might see a pair of young girls skating around the rink in black velvet frock coats. Established in 1936, Sun Valley generally is accepted as the first destination ski resort in the United States (although some argue the honor belongs to Peckett's-on-Sugar-Hill, established in 1929 back East in Franconia, New Hampshire). Union Pacific Railroad developed the first chairlift in the world at Sun Valley, said Jack Sibbach, director of public relations for the resort. Two ski mountains loom over the immediate area. One is Dollar, which at $40 per day for adults is a magnet for families who send their young children snowplowing down the gentle slopes as part of Dollar's extensive lesson program. Dollar has just five lifts and 10 runs, making it the kind of place where you can set your kids loose on skis with a reasonable expectation of spotting them here and there on the mountain throughout the day. Just down the road is the huge Bald Mountain, where you are liable to see spectacular feats of skiing prowess, some performed by senior citizen virtuosos. Baldy has 65 runs and 14 lifts, including a brand-new eight-passenger gondola that travels 2,000 vertical feet in less than eight minutes. Tickets at Baldy start at $82 for adults, although as with Dollar, check the Web site for deals. Then there is the more modest Soldier Mountain, 50 miles southwest of Hailey. Soldier is co-owned by Bruce Willis. The lodge at the base of the ski area was destroyed last year in a fire, but it is being rebuilt. Construction is in the final phase,and a notice on Soldier's Web site said a Jan. 28 opening was likely. Sun Valley's skiing history is irresistible. Warren Miller, whose annual 'Off the Grid' documentaries showcase extreme skiing and other winter sports, began his career while living in a camping trailer in the Baldy parking lot. Sun Valley Lodge's walls are lined with photos of the Hollywood types who have skied there over the year -- including Oscar-winning actor and director Clint Eastwood, actor Gary Cooper, Nobel laureate writer Ernest Hemingway, Schwarzenegger, a few members of the Kennedy family and former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Tip O'Neill. It has also been host to many famous names in the skiing world, including Chuck Ferries, who helped develop the fiberglass ski, and Dick Durrance of the 1936 Olympics. 'It has a special place in the hearts of veteran skiers in the United States because it had some of the first classic alpine races in the United States,' said Seth Masia, a former SKI Magazine editor who writes about history for Skiing Heritage Magazine and is a veteran skier himself. 'It's one of the important cultural centers of American skiing.' Sun Valley and its neighboring communities also have a long history of gathering wealthy visitors and local characters. Legend has it that Hemingway, a longtime on-and-off resident of Ketchum, wrote at least part of 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' in a room in the Sun Valley Lodge. Hemingway is memorialized by a statue on a trail a mile from the lodge and is buried in Ketchum, where he spent the last two years of his life. He killed himself there with a shotgun on July 2, 1961, at age 61. Hiking and mountain biking abound in the uncrowded Sawtooth Mountains. 'Every little canyon has its trails,' said Smith. Ketchum has high-end dining, shopping and art. Hailey markets itself as a more down-to-earth destination, the kind of place where you can find more affordable lodging at the brand-new AmericInn or just camp out in the summer to attend the Northern Rockies Folk Festival downtown. Bruce Willis often can be found playing in his band at The Mint, a bar he owns in Hailey. In warmer months, many visitors stay in Hailey and spend the day at the Silver Creek Preserve, a high-desert Nature Conservancy area with an abundance of wildlife. Silver Creek is a clear, spring-fed stream. 'It's challenging, with big fish, and a chance to catch brown trout and rainbow trout in the same river,' said Chris Walser, a biology professor at the College of Idaho who also fishes the nearby Big Wood River. 'And it's world-famous. You say you went to Silver Creek, and most fly fishermen are going to know where that is.' ------ If You Go...

1,"Stir-Fried Cucumber and Pork With Golden Garlic 2 to 3 servings This is characteristic of a yin-yang stir-fry, so called because it combines cooling ingredients (such as cucumber) with the heat of others (in this case, garlic and ginger). Garlic mellowed by frying is the main seasoning here; some of the oil used for the garlic is then incorporated in the dish. It's best to use an instant-read thermometer to gauge the temperature of the oil. Pork shoulder or butt doesn't usually come in small amounts. Ask your butcher to cut down a larger roast; freeze what you don't use for this recipe. Serve with steamed rice. Adapted from Grace Young's 'Stir-Frying to the Sky's Edge' (Simon & Schuster, 2010). Ingredients 1/2 cup peanut or vegetable oil 3 to 5 large cloves garlic 12 ounces boneless lean pork shoulder or butt (see headnote) 2- to 3-inch piece ginger root 1 large (seedless) English cucumber 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 1/4 teaspoon sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon cold water Steps Line a plate with paper towels. Heat the oil in a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or small saucepan over medium heat, or as needed, so the oil reaches a temperature of 280 degrees. (Make sure the tip of the thermometer does not touch the wok or saucepan.) Coarsely chop the garlic as needed to yield 3 tablespoons. Trim off and discard any fat from the pork, then cut the meat into 1/4-inch or bite-size slices (to yield about 2 1/2 cups). Peel the ginger and cut it crosswise into 8 coin-size slices, then use the broad, flat side of a knife to smash each one. Trim off the ends of the cucumber, then use a vegetable peeler to cut away long strips of peel, creating a striped effect. Cut the cucumber on the diagonal into 1/4-inch slices (to yield about 3 cups). Add the garlic to the hot oil and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the garlic is just golden. Use a metal skimmer to transfer the garlic to the paper-towel-lined plate. Strain the oil into a heatproof container. Combine the pork, cornstarch, half of the soy sauce (1 1/2 teaspoons), the sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl; toss to coat evenly. Combine the remaining soy sauce and the water in a separate small bowl. If you used the wok to heat the oil, wash and dry it thoroughly before placing it over high heat. Or heat a 12-inch skillet (not nonstick) over high heat. When the wok or skillet is hot, add a drop of water; the heat is sufficient when the water vaporizes within 2 seconds. Swirl in 2 tablespoons of the reserved garlic oil, then add the ginger. Stir-fry for 30 seconds or until the ginger becomes fragrant. Push it to the sides of the wok or skillet, then add the pork in a single layer. Cook undisturbed for 1 minute so the pork sears, then stir-fry for 1 minute, until the meat is seared but not fully cooked through. Add the cucumber and stir-fry for 30 seconds, making sure it is well incorporated, then sprinkle on the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the soy sauce-water mixture. Stir-fry for 1 minute or until the pork is cooked through and the cucumber has begun to wilt. Stir in the reserved garlic and remove from the heat. Divide among individual bowls; serve immediately.

1,"The browser wars are back in full flower, for which we have Google and the European Union to thank. Google's big plans for its Chrome browser seem to have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Meanwhile, starting next month, the EU will require customers who buy new computers in Europe to be presented with a screen at startup listing a dozen browsers in random order, and given a choice of which and how many they want to install. It's all part of an antitrust settlement with Microsoft. The result should be a boon to consumers and to online innovation. But you don't have to be European, or even own a new PC, to download these free programs and start exploring. Non-Microsoft software makers are apt to say the biggest thing that keeps users from switching browsers is ignorance. A surprising number of people, they say, don't understand what a browser is or does. To them, that big 'e' on the computer desktop simply means 'the Internet,' and they aren't aware of the multitude of alternatives for accessing the Web. In the interest of education, Google has created a Web site at whatbrowser.org. It includes links to five browsers -- including Microsoft's as well as Google's -- along with an informational video, benchmark tests and other resources. Chrome, which is available in versions for Windows, Mac and Linux, is a key part of Google's strategy to get computer users comfortable with so-called cloud computing. The idea is for everyone to spend less money and time on programs they buy from software companies (Microsoft, say), and rely more on data and services such as Google Docs, which reside on servers and storage systems on the `net. Described this way, Chrome sounds like a Trojan horse to make us all dependent on Google's own services. And so it is. But for Google's plans to work, Chrome has to be good. And so it is. The program is fast, flexible and rests lightly atop your computer's operating system -- a fine thing from a security standpoint, because it makes it harder than Internet Explorer for hackers to use as an entree into your computer's innards. Mac users probably have it easiest: The best browser comes built right into every computer. It's Safari, Apple's own program. Apple has managed to avoid the controversy stirred by Microsoft's similar bundling of Internet Explorer with the operating system primarily because it has only a fraction of Windows' market share. Safari is also available in a Windows version that I'm less enamored of; I'm more likely to run into Web sites that don't display properly or work quite right than happens with other Windows browsers. The blame for that probably rests more with those site developers than with Apple; still, with so many good alternatives, it's seldom worth the effort to figure out just what's wrong. Personally, I prefer Mozilla Firefox, a descendant of the Netscape browser that Microsoft vanquished in Browser War I. Maintained by an open-source community, Firefox is available for PCs, Macs and Linux computers, and is the second-most- used browser after Internet Explorer. The program benefits from a well-developed ecosystem that includes thousands of add-ons for everything from speeding up YouTube downloads to StumbleUpon, which adds a button that helps you discover and share Web sites that match your interests. Opera, from the Norwegian company Opera Software, is another good choice. Opera, which has been around since the earliest days of the Web, is available in Mac, Linux and PC versions. And of course, there's Internet Explorer itself. The current version, IE 8, was released last year with a slew of enhancements. Microsoft has promised that the next version, will be faster and harder for bad guys to hack into. Each browser has legions of fans, and I'm not quite dumb enough to try to tell you which one is best: I wouldn't have time enough to answer the hate mail from devotees of all the others. What I can say is that this is the perfect time to break the shackles of habit and try something different. Better still, try them all. Rich Jaroslovsky is a Bloomberg News columnist. "
1,"Two of the country's largest unions have resolved a vicious feud that roiled organized labor for 18 months, costing it hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, undermining each other's organizing efforts, and distracting it from opportunities presented by Democratic control of Congress and the White House. The dispute began in earnest in spring 2009 with the breakup of Unite Here, a union that was created by the 2004 merger of the hotel and restaurant workers union, Here, and the garment workers union, Unite. The hope had been that the merged union could combine Here's sizable membership and growth potential with the considerable financial assets of Unite, which owned Amalgamated Bank but had seen its membership decline sharply over time. But the merger proved an ill-fitting marriage, and the breakup in early 2009 was ugly. The leader of the Unite faction, Bruce Raynor, formed a new union called Workers United, affiliated with the 1.8 million-member Service Employees International Union. While he sought to attract as many members as possible for Workers United, the remaining Unite Here, led by John Wilhelm, tried to keep his membership base and to claim financial assets that Unite had brought into the merger. Further complicating matters was the role played by then-SEIU President Andy Stern. The influential labor leader hoped to capitalize on the split by joining forces with ally Raynor, but many others in the labor movement took offense at Stern's intervention in the breakup of another union. As the fight dragged on, SEIU spent millions to subsidize Workers United. In an interview after he announced his retirement in April, Stern sounded ambivalent about the decision to intervene, saying it might pay off in a wave of members for SEIU but also comparing it to the decision to invade Iraq. Under the settlement reached Monday night, SEIU and Workers United will gain control of Amalgamated Bank, the only labor-owned bank, but Unite Here will maintain control of many other assets, including the union's New York headquarters, the historic home of the garment workers' union. Unite Here, meanwhile, will retain most of the members of the merged union: It will maintain jurisdiction over hotel and casino workers as well as food service workers at stadiums, convention centers, private companies and airports. In addition to the dwindling number of remaining garment and laundry workers, SEIU and Workers United will have jurisdiction over food service workers in sectors where SEIU has made inroads, such as hospitals, prisons and government buildings. While Workers United claimed to have drawn away as many as 100,000 of Unite Here's 265,000 members during the past year, the settlement restores the vast majority of the members, more than 200,000, to the Unite Here fold. In a statement, Wilhelm congratulated SEIU's new president, Mary Kay Henry, with an implicit slight of her predecessor, Stern. 'For the sake of workers and the labor movement, I hope that this is the first step in making SEIU the great union it can be under her leadership,' he said. Henry said in a statement that that he hoped the settlement would allow unions to push organized labor's agenda more effectively. Unions have scored some victories in the past year but have fallen short on their top priority, legislation to make it easier to organize workers. Henry did not say whether she planned to try to mend more fences by also negotiating a return of SEIU to the AFL-CIO, the labor federation that SEIU and several other unions broke from five years ago, though she did pledge to 'link arms with our allies in labor' and 'forge stronger relationships.' 'Despite the tensions that have existed between our unions over the past months, John Wilhelm, Bruce Raynor and I have worked together to find common ground, and we've been able to put our differences behind us,' she said. 'We agree that we cannot be spending our time fighting one other over workers who are already represented when there are far too many people who want and need a voice on the job. Our resources and our attention must be put toward solutions for the crisis workers face right now.' "

1,"The oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico was coming out at least twice as fast as officials said initially, government officials said Thursday, meaning that it has become the largest U.S. oil spill. In a news conference Thursday morning, U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said that the oil was coming out at a rate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day. Originally, officials from the Coast Guard and BP had estimated the flow at 5,000 barrels a day. The flow rate measurements were taken before the attempt at a 'top kill' of the leaking well began Wednesday. That effort, which flooded the well with high- pressure mud, has made it difficult to determine how much oil is leaking out now. But McNutt's estimate made it clear that this spill is larger than the nation's previous worst spill, the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. That incident, which has generally been reported in gallons as opposed to barrels, dumped 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. That is about 257,000 barrels. (A barrel contains about 42 gallons of oil.) Using the low end of the new estimate _ 12,000 barrels a day _ this spill is larger than the Valdez disaster. Using the high end, it is more than twice as large. A spokesman for the Interior Department, Frank Quimby, said a team of scientists had calculated the new estimates using three techniques. One used video of the plume of oil escaping from the pipe and then used computer modeling to come up with an estimate of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels a day. Another relied on a NASA plane, which flew over the gulf using equipment designed to tell oil from water on the surface. Its analysis yielded an estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day. A third method relied on measurements from a tube stuck into a leaking pipe, which has siphoned some of the leaking oil to the surface. By analyzing that flow, the team of scientists estimated the flow was 12,000 barrels a day. Quimby said the final estimate was made by combining those three. He said the team had not determined whether the rate had increased or decreased over time. 'This is the current rate, and it's probably been the average rate for a month,' Quimby said, meaning before the top kill began. "
1,"Strong winds fanned forest fires for a second day Sunday on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palm, and firefighters were forced to retreat as flames raged out of control near two towns. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero visited areas affected by fire and viewed firefighting efforts on the island late Sunday. 'I'm conscious of the damage done; I've witnessed it myself,' Zapatero said, adding that he hoped better news would be coming soon. A large plume of smoke could be seen rising from the 706 sq. kilometer (273 sq. mile) island's southern tip where fires were active on two fronts. Fire-tracing satellites showed the smoke was visible from Earth orbit and trailed many kilometers, blotting out the neighboring island of La Gomera. La Palma is one of the least developed and most verdant of the Canary Islands, off West Africa, and was praised by pop star Madonna in her song 'La Isla Bonita.' The island is home to many archeologically valuable sites, including remnants of prehistoric human dwellings places as well as very early art. Firefighters on the eastern side of the island had to pull back due to intense fires near the towns of Fuencaliente and Tigalete, regional government security counselor Jose Miguel Ruano said. About 500 firefighters have been deployed along with seven water-dropping aircraft. Some 4,000 residents were evacuated from the area Saturday. Flames have so far destroyed about 50 homes in Fuencaliente, according to the mayor, Gregorio Alonso. Several small wineries that once made artisan-quality wines from the region's renowned Malvasia grapevines have also been lost to the flames. Canary wine has been famous since William Shakespeare's time and the poet referred to it several times in his play 'Merry Wives of Windsor.' Tigalete is home to around 2,000 German families, many of them retired, said Jose Perez, German consul on the island. Many were among those evacuated. Officials were worried the fire could spread north toward Caldera de Taburiente national park, home to several endangered native species such as the Canary Islands Juniper. Environment counselor Vladimiro Rodriguez said several fires started almost simultaneously, usually a sign they could be man-made. Around 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) had been destroyed by fire by midday Sunday. A fire on the nearby island of La Gomera -- the second in two days -- was brought under control. ------ Associated Press writer Harold Heckle in Madrid contributed to this report. "
1,"Iran has pardoned or reduced the sentences of 81 people convicted in connection with protests over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's June 12 re-election. Wednesday's announcement of the pardons coincided with a request to the government from opposition groups for permission to hold demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the disputed vote. The opposition alleges Ahmadinejad's victory was the result of fraud. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei agreed to the pardons and cuts in sentences on the recommendation of the judiciary chief, according to Khamenei's website. Such actions are traditional to mark a religious or national celebration, in this case Thursday's anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima. 'Some of them were immediately released last night after the supreme leader's pardon,' Tehran Prosecutor-General Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi was cited as saying by the state-run Fars news agency Thursday. Last year's protests began with calls for a ballot recount, and subsequent demands have ranged from an end to the security forces' use of violence against protesters to changes in Iran's religion-based political system. About 5,000 people have been arrested, with many later released, and 44 people have died, Iranian authorities say. At least 10 have been sentenced to death for their alleged roles in the unrest. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, the main challengers in the election, wrote to the governor of the Tehran province asking for permission to hold a joint rally on the anniversary of the vote. Eight political groups followed with their own request to the central government to organize a June 12 gathering, according to Parleman News, the website of an opposition faction in the parliament. The government hasn't authorized any of the demonstrations by the opposition since the election. Only pro-government rallies have been permitted. Ex-Prime Minister Mousavi and former parliament Speaker Karrubi both say the vote was rigged, a claim rejected by Ahmadinejad and Khamenei. Khamenei will lead Friday prayers in Tehran, the biggest in the Persian Gulf country, preceded by an address by Ahmadinejad. Khamenei, who has led the prayers mainly for special events, spoke at the first Friday prayers after the election, warning of a crackdown on demonstrators and backing Ahmadinejad as president. Khamenei and Ahmadinejad's participation will mark the anniversary of the death of the Shiite Muslim-led state's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. "
1,"England has made no surprise choices in its squad for the defense of the Ashes against Australia, with Monty Panesar, Chris Tremlett and Steven Davies winning the race for three of the backup roles in the 16-man test party. Panesar, whose most recent appearance for England was in last year's home Ashes series, has been recalled as the deputy to first-choice offspinner Graeme Swann. Lanky pace bowler Tremlett is back in the squad after winning his last cap in 2007 against India and Davies will be the reserve wicketkeeper behind Matt Prior. The rest of the squad picked itself, with selectors choosing seven batsmen, two wicketkeepers, five fast bowlers and two spinners. The first test of the five-match series begins in Brisbane on Nov. 25. "
1,"Bank of America Corp. could eventually shrink its 6,100-branch network by about 10 percent as consumers utilize other methods of banking, a company spokesman said Tuesday. Bank of America spokesman James Mahoney made the comments when asked about a published report that CEO Ken Lewis and another bank executive described such a plan to investors at a meeting last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the bank is based. The move would be a pullback from the bank's two-decade expansion, most recently under Lewis' command, which expanded the bank from coast to coast. 'What took place was a discussion about the long-term direction of the company,' Mahoney said. 'Over the longer-term, as customer demands evolve, we see a fewer number of branches that provide more services.' The bank does not have a specific number of branches that will ultimately compose its franchise, Mahoney said, adding there's no immediate plan to close 10 percent of the bank's branches. 'In response to a question from an investor on the magnitude of branch closings, Lewis did acknowledge that the range could be potentially 10 percent,' Mahoney said. Shares of Bank of America rose 8 cents to $13.17 in morning trading Tuesday. Liam McGee, president of Bank of America's consumer and small-business bank, was also part of the meeting, Mahoney confirmed. The Wall Street Journal said in Tuesday's edition that Mgee cited changing customer preferences for the move and noted more people are using online and mobile banking. The news comes as Bank of America continues to be under the careful watch of the U.S. government, while it works to integrate two recent deals. Bank of America acquired troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. last summer and investment bank Merrill Lynch & Co. in January. Those two acquisitions have proven challenging for Lewis, who was stripped of his chairman title by a shareholder vote at his company's annual meeting in April. The bank and Lewis have been under intense scrutiny because Bank of America is one of the biggest recipients of government bailout money -- $45 billion -- and because the losses at Merrill Lynch turned out to be much higher than expected. It is not known when it will repay the government. Last week, Bank of America announced a big second-quarter profit, but tempered the news by reporting it is still contending with losses from failed loans. During a call with analysts, Lewis said it would be 'much tougher' to turn a profit for the rest of the year. 'Closing branches actually makes a lot of sense from a standpoint of trying to cut costs and have profitability,' said Jason O'Donnell, a senior research analyst at Boenning & Scattergood Inc. And because of the bank's numerous acquisitions over the years, 'BofA does have the luxury of looking back and getting rid of overlap and overhead,' O'Donnell said. Bank of America has become a financial powerhouse befitting of its name. First under chief executive Hugh McColl Jr., and since 2001 under Lewis, the bank has grown through acquisition from a little North Carolina National Bank into a behemoth that holds more assets and deposits than any U.S. bank. In 2004, the bank acquired FleetBoston Financial, a move that gave Bank of America $133 billion in deposits in eight Northeastern states. Three years ago it added millions of names to its customer ledger through the purchase of credit card issuer MBNA Corp. In 2007, the bank completed its purchase of wealth management company U.S. Trust and acquired LaSalle Bank Corp., immediately turning Lewis' bank into the market leader in Chicago. The acquisition of California-based Countrywide last year brought Bank of America to the forefront of the mortgage business, and the Merrill Lynch deal bought the bank a large presence back on Wall Street.

1,"An independent commission reported Tuesday the Dutch government let politics override law when it supported the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and ignored intelligence that downplayed the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons program. The 551-page report said U.N. resolutions in the 1990s prior to the outbreak of war gave no authority to the United States and Britain to invade Iraq. 'The military action had no sound mandate under international law,' the report said. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said he disagreed with that assessment. 'The Cabinet's view has always been that a new Security Council resolution (authorizing the invasion) was desirable, but not necessary,' he said. He insisted his government acted 'honorably' and its stance was supported by a majority in Parliament. The commission found that when the government decided in August 2002 to support the attack it treated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction and the legality of an invasion as 'subservient.' The Cabinet's policy was laid out in a 45-minute meeting, and came at a time when the newly elected prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, was preoccupied with serious domestic concerns, it said. The report's findings regarding the war's illegality could be damaging to Balkenende. But it said persistent rumors that the Dutch were militarily involvement in the operation were untrue. The long-awaited report said Dutch intelligence agencies were 'more reserved' in their assessments than the government when discussing the program in parliament. Balkenende said he would further study the report's 49 conclusions before debating them with lawmakers in Parliament. In 2003, in the buildup to the Iraq War, the United States dropped an attempt to get a Security Council resolution approving the invasion when it became apparent that it would not pass. Then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2004 called the invasion 'illegal.' ------ Associated Press reporter Toby Sterling in Amsterdam contributed to this report "

Three people familiar with Pakistani-born Syed Hashmi's case tell The Associated Press that Hashmi was to admit to a single criminal count on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the plea. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday in the trial for 30-year-old Hashmi, who was arrested in 2006 in London. He had faced up to 70 years in prison if convicted of four criminal counts, including material support for terrorism. "
1,"Alvarez & Marsal, the liquidator of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings, has collected $262.2 million in fees over 18 months, according to a regulatory filing. The restructuring firm, which provided Lehman with its current chief executive officer, Bryan Marsal, is billing the bankruptcy estate for 'interim management,' according to Thursday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The defunct investment bank has paid all of its lawyers and advisers $731.6 million through March 31, it said in the filing. Lehman, which before it failed used accounting methods that concealed billions of dollars of risks, according to an examiner's report, is liquidating to pay creditors. Its payments to managers and advisers haven't faced major objections such as those in the case of bankrupt automaker Chrysler, which used U.S. Treasury loans to wind itself down. 'The way the system's supposed to work is creditors stand up and object to the fees, which essentially come out of their payments,' said Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law in Champaign who tracks fees. 'They don't throw good money after bad because at best they can only increase their payout a little.' Dennis Dunne, a lawyer for the Lehman creditors' committee, didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment. His firm, Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy, got $47.7 million through March 31 for advising the committee. Marsal said his firm's bills are driven by 'the sheer size and complexity' of the case, with much of the cost coming from handling Lehman's illiquid assets such as real estate. The real cost of administering those assets is less than six-tenths of 1 percent, he said in an e-mail Thursday. 'Overall, this has been a very efficiently administered Chapter 11 case,' he said. About 150 Alvarez & Marsal employees are working full time at Lehman, according to Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman. As part of a five-year plan to run Lehman's least saleable assets, Marsal created a unit called Lamco, which will provide longer-term jobs for 70 employees of Alvarez & Marsal, co-headed by Marsal, as well as for 385 Lehman workers, according to court filings. That would give it twice as many workers as the company entrusted with running the bankruptcy. The defunct investment bank also disclosed fees paid to the law firms mounting suits against Barclays, scheduled to go on trial April 26 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over Lehman's allegation that it made an $11 billion 'windfall' on its 2008 purchase of the North American Lehman brokerage. Jones Day, Lehman's special counsel for U.S. and Asian litigation, made $20.5 million through March 31. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges, special counsel to the creditors' committee, made $6 million, according to the filing. Jenner & Block, the law firm headed by Lehman examiner Anton Valukas, earned $48.4 million for more than a year's work producing a 2,200-page report on the bankruptcy that was the subject of a hearing in Washington this week about flaws in regulation of banks. Weil Gotshal & Manges of New York collected $164.8 million for acting as the investment bank's lead bankruptcy law firm. Lehman and its affiliates reported cash holdings of $16.6 billion on March 31, down from $17.2 billion at the start of the month. Previously, its cash had risen by as much as $1 billion a month. "
1,"LOS ANGELES - The Toyota Venza has been called many things, including wagon, crossover and compact sport-utility vehicle. But Toyota insists that it's a car. So I'll roll with that. The problem is more a matter of market perception than it is one of manufacturer nomenclature. The Venza is a vehicle of reinforced unitized construction built on the platform of the Toyota Camry, still the best-selling family sedan in the United States. That bolsters Toyota's claim that the Venza is a car. But the Venza's ground clearance, the distance between its chassis and the ground, is 8.1 inches - nearly three inches higher than the Toyota Camry's ground clearance of 5.5 inches. That, in the minds of many, puts the Venza in SUV territory. Still, the Venza is nobody's SUV, truck or crossover utility vehicle. It rides and handles like a midsize family sedan. Equipped with optional all-wheel drive and the standard 2.7-liter in-line four-cylinder engine (182 horsepower, 182 foot-pounds of torque) - the arrangement sampled for this column - the Venza accelerates and handles in the manner of an underpowered midsize family sedan. As illustrated by the huge number of four-cylinder vehicles on display here at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show - running through Sunday - four-cylinder engines are growing in favor among the world's automobile manufacturers, all of which are being pressured by governments for more when it comes to fuel economy and less when it comes to tailpipe emissions. But not all four-cylinder engines are alike. Their performance can be enhanced or diminished by the kinds of vehicles in which they are installed and the ancillary equipment, such as all-wheel drive, to which they are attached. The standard engine in the all-wheel-drive Venza is overwhelmed by the high- riding posture and factory weight (3,945 pounds before occupants and luggage) of that vehicle. For that reason, this column recommends the Venza's optional 3.5-liter V-6 (268 horsepower, 246 foot-pounds of torque). There is a marginal fuel penalty for choosing the V-6 engine - a combined city-highway rating of 21 miles per gallon compared with a combined 22 mpg for the four-cylinder model, both using regular gasoline. But acceleration and handling are discernibly better with the V-6. The Venza, originally launched in 2009, is aimed at Toyota loyalists who need more space than what is afforded them in the Camry sedan. The Venza gives them that space in many creative ways - there are storage bins in doors, the central console, atop the instrument panel and under seats. The problem for Toyota is that the Venza is not a leadership vehicle. It is surrounded by competitors, such as the Nissan Juke and Honda Crosstour, that have more provocative exterior styling and better on-road performance. It will be trounced by the forthcoming Land Rover Range Rover Evoque - a compact, wagonlike SUV with a turbocharged 2-liter four-cylinder engine, designed to ride like a sedan, to accelerate in the manner of a sports car, and to deliver off- road performance competitive with Jeeps and larger Land Rover models. The Venza is not likely to win buyers attracted to those rival machines. It is likely, however, to continue holding on to those many Toyota customers who love their Camry sedans but now find themselves in need or in want of more hauling ability. "
1,"A day after Missouri voters rejected a key component of the nation's new health- care overhaul, Republicans seized on the result as conclusive evidence that Americans don't like the law. Primary voters in Missouri were the first to vote directly on the law, in a ballot referendum that prohibits the federal government from requiring people to have health insurance. The measure passed 71 percent to 29 percent. Supporters of the overhaul played down the vote, noting that it has no practical impact and that Tuesday's electorate was largely Republican. But they conceded that a lack of public support could make it hard to put the law into practice. Lawmakers in several other states, such as Virginia, have already passed laws rejecting the 'individual mandate,' a central feature of the health-care overhaul. The state laws, including Missouri's, are largely symbolic because they are trumped by federal law. More consequential are the legal challenges that have been brought by Republican state attorneys general, including a lawsuit by Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli. A federal judge ruled Monday that Virginia's suit can go forward, rejecting arguments from the Obama administration that the state had no standing to sue. Regardless, Republicans said Wednesday that the vote in Missouri marks a turning point in the health-care debate. 'It sends a big message to the country,' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who won the Republican primary in Missouri's Senate race. 'This is the first time voters have had a chance at the ballot box to register their feeling about this bill. (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid kept saying, `We know people don't like this, but once we pass it they're really going to like it.' Well, as it turned out ... they still don't like it.' But supporters of the national law argued that the electorate was far from representative. Turnout was far higher on the Republican side, where Blunt was facing a more competitive field than Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan was on the Democratic side. About two-thirds of the voters participated in the Republican Senate primary, and turnout in Democratic strongholds such as St. Louis and Kansas City was among the lowest in the state. And Missouri in general is conservative on health-care policy _ its Medicaid eligibility policy is among the most stringent in the country. The overhaul's backers also pointed to national polls that show an uptick in support for the new law. 'We're trying not to read too much into it, because we know it's a very small percentage of registered voters and that very conservative primary races were being decided,' said Amy Blouin, founder of the Missouri Budget Project, a liberal advocacy group. The national law broadens coverage through three interdependent steps: insurers must offer coverage to people with preexisting conditions; to make this affordable for insurers and to keep people from waiting until they get sick to seek coverage, everyone be insured; and to help people afford coverage, the government offers income-based subsidies. Blouin said there is a lack of clarity about the mandate's context in Missouri, where 14 percent of people under age 65 don't have coverage. 'People don't understand that the mandate is not happening in a vacuum,' she said. 'Middle- class families, small businesses will all benefit from support.' Opponents say the mandate is unconstitutional because it forces people to buy a commercial product. Supporters, and many legal experts, say it falls within the government's power to tax and regulate interstate commerce. But even if the mandate survives in court, the federal government and the states will face major challenges in getting people to comply. The requirement goes into effect in 2014, and penalties for not buying insurance will eventually rise to a maximum of 2.5 percent of income. In Massachusetts, which included a mandate in its 2006 universal coverage law, most people have complied _ but only 9 percent of residents had been uninsured, and there was a bipartisan consensus on the law. Getting people to comply will be more difficult in states with far larger numbers of uninsured, with elected officials who are railing against the law and with electorates that are far more resistant, as Missouri's vote suggests. 'Implementation ... really does require significant state support,' said Harvard health policy expert Robert Blendon. 'You could end up with a bifurcated country _ with some states getting ready and others doing as little as possible.' Jon Kingsdale, who ran Massachusetts's health-care program until recently, is more optimistic. While the mandate is the most tempting target for the law's opponents, he predicted that more and more state officials will start preparing for it as 2014 approaches. 'As we get closer to 2014 _ and if those who oppose it don't succeed in tearing it apart _ the momentum builds,' he said. "
1,"Ivan Tcherezov of Russia shot cleanly Sunday to win a men's 15-kilometer biathlon World Cup race, and Simone Hauswald of Germany won the women's event. The 29-year-old Tcherezov finished in 40 minutes, 10.1 seconds to beat Cristoph Sumann of Austria by 26.3 seconds. Overall World Cup leader Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway was third, cutting his lead over Sumann to just nine points with two individual events left. Hauswald earned her third straight victory after winning the women's 12.5K mass start. Hauswald also won the sprint and pursuit races in Holmenkollen this week, and finished Sunday's race in 37 minutes, 0.7 seconds after missing two targets. Vita Semerenko of Ukraine shot cleanly to finish second, 14.7 seconds behind Hauswald. Overall World Cup leader Magdalena Neuner of Germany was third, 22.2 seconds back after three misses. "
1,Prosecutors say a man linked to a terrorism suspect who planned to attack New York City with homemade bombs lied to federal investigators. Brooklyn prosecutors have indicted Afghan-born Zarein Ahmedzay on charges of making material false statements. He is expected to appear in court later Friday. Ahmedzay and Bosnian-born Adis Medunjanin were arrested Friday after officials linked them last year to the investigation of Afghan-born Najibullah Zazi. He was charged in a plot to bomb New York City. Prosecutors say Ahmedzay didn't name all the places he had visited in Pakistan and Afghanistan while visiting in late 2008 and early 2009. The indictment also says Ahmedzay lied when he denied having discussions about attending a camp to receive military-type training. Ahmedzay's brother has said he is not guilty. 
1,"Overlooked among the systems that apparently failed in the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe is what could be the most crucial safety device of all: the human blowout preventer. Every person working on the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico had the authority to stop action, according to the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon, if he or she considered the situation unsafe. Yet people exposed to an array of hazards refrained from demanding a halt, reflecting a pattern that extends to almost any office cubicle or industrial site. It is hard to rock the boat _ until it bursts into flames and sinks to the bottom of the ocean _ and a safety policy based on the assumption that any individual will rock the boat is likely to be flawed. Case in point: Michael Williams, a chief electronics technician on the Deepwater Horizon who displayed remarkable courage during the disaster and who brought those challenges into focus in testimony to a federal investigative board last month. He described speaking up about problems but there were limits to what he could or would do. Williams, an employee of rig owner Transocean, said he thought that the blowout preventer _ the last line of defense against a gusher _ had been damaged and that he had seen chunks of its black rubber innards ejected from the well. There was never enough time to keep up with scheduled maintenance on the rig, he said, and some parts were so old that it took a year to get replacements custom made. In addition, to avoid the nuisance of false alarms, a system meant to automatically warn the entire crew about fire or leaking gas was routinely deactivated. Meanwhile, a computer used to monitor and control drilling operations intermittently crashed, leaving the driller staring at 'the blue screen of death.' In the middle of sensitive operations, the driller could switch chairs and move to backup computers, but if the backups failed, Williams said, the next step would be to 'abandon ship.' Switching to a backup is not without risk, he pointed out: During the drilling of an earlier well, while the computer was out of commission for several seconds, the rig incurred a kick of gas, he said. At the government hearing in Kenner, La., attorneys for BP, Transocean and the captain of the Deepwater Horizon pressed Williams about his power to shut down the rig. 'I want to ask whether or not you knew that you in fact not only had a right but you had an obligation to stop anything that you believed to be unsafe,' asked Kyle Schonekas, an attorney for the captain. 'Yes,' Williams said. 'You ever ask to stop operations on the rig because of the blue screen of death?' BP attorney Richard Godfrey asked. 'No, I did not. We had two other chairs,' Williams answered. 'Did anyone ever ask anyone to stop operations on the rig because of the inhibited alarms?' 'Not to my knowledge.' 'You never did that?' 'No, I did not.' In an interview, a lawyer for Williams, Scott R. Bickford, said Williams stopped work 'all the time' for 'minor infractions' _ for example, to caution a co- worker to use ear plugs. When it came to the alarm configuration, Williams reported concerns to superiors, and he considered his responsibility fulfilled when he was told that management wanted it that way, Bickford said. The blue screen of death was known up and down the chain of command, Williams testified. What was Williams supposed to do, his attorney asked, stand in the middle of the Deepwater Horizon and say, 'I'm shutting the rig down'? 'Realistically, you're painting a situation that _ that doesn't make much sense.' Investigations of the drilling of the Macondo well have shown that a variety of concerns arose _ about issues as diverse as the type of cement job and the number of devices used to center the pipe in the hole _ and the work continued. Transocean, the company that operated the Deepwater Horizon under contract to BP, placed such emphasis on its timeout-for-safety policy that it spelled it out in a health and safety manual, reinforced it through training and recognized employees for exercising it. The company condensed its stop-work policy to an oxymoronic acronym: START, for see, think, act, reinforce and track. 'In fact, we promote them to stop the job ... even if it turns out that it actually was safe but they had doubts about it,' Adrian Rose, Transocean's health, safety and environmental manager, told federal investigators in May. Daniel Becnel, a Louisiana lawyer representing victims of the oil spill, suggested that the expectation is unrealistic. 'They kept telling you that any man could have stopped the rig at any time. But that never happens in real life,' he said. 'If anybody would do it, that would be the last hitch they would be on an offshore drilling rig.' Yet it does happen. Rose estimated that over the past five years, across the Transocean fleet of '100-odd rigs,' the stop-work policy has been invoked hundreds of times. But BP well team leader John Guide testified that during the drilling of the Macondo well, such events mainly involved 'lifting-type operations' _ situations where somebody might be in the wrong place while equipment is being moved. Guide said he did not recall any such steps involving 'the well bore construction operation.' Aboard the Deepwater Horizon, addressing concerns about the engineering of the well or the condition of the rig would have required more than a momentary pause in action. A government investigation of another incident in the Gulf of Mexico shows that even where crew complaints reach the boiling point it can be a mistake to depend on people to call a timeout. The Minerals Management Service investigation of a 2006 blowout found that several crew members thought that operations on a Forest Oil platform were so dangerous that they took a boat back to shore, even after the man leading the operations said they would be fired for leaving, according to a government report. The man allegedly issuing the orders stayed behind with a shorthanded crew and was killed when equipment ejected from the well. Before the blowout, a supervisor refused to carry out an instruction from the boss, fearing it could leave the well out of control. The supervisor 'felt the job was unsafe from the beginning,' wanted to get off the platform and would have boarded the boat with the others if he had been awake at the time, the report said. Despite his worries, he did not shut down the job. "
1,"Sheri Fink had a medical degree, a doctorate and a nose for news, along with a tendency to rush off to disaster zones from Kosovo to Iraq. What she didn't have was a steady paycheck to support her journalism. Once Fink was hired by the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica, she spent a year investigating a New Orleans hospital where 45 patients died during Hurricane Katrina. And last week the New York Times Magazine shared a Pulitzer Prize for running her powerful, 13,000-word piece. This is a glimpse of an unexpected future: a battered newspaper business, an idealistic start-up with a deep-pocketed liberal backer, and dogged reporters who otherwise might be out of work. If the Times was piggybacking on ProPublica _ which covered about half the $400,000 cost of the investigation _ the paper has plenty of company. 'That's what we're here for,' says Paul Steiger, the former Wall Street Journal managing editor who founded ProPublica and makes its stories available to interested outlets. 'The goal is not about getting credit. The goal is getting the story before the eyes of the people who can most benefit from it.' Herbert Sandler, a 78-year-old former bank owner who is giving the venture roughly $10 million a year, says his motivation is simple: 'I can't stand the abuse of power. I can't stand corruption. I can't stand the powerful taking advantage of those with less power.' Fink, 41, who still lectures at Harvard and Tulane but says she finds reporting more challenging, wants to change what she sees as a dysfunctional medical system. 'This may be a vain hope or an idealistic hope,' she says, 'but I hope that could help prevent some of the horrific experiences that were had in New Orleans.' There was a time when most major journalistic investigations were carried out by newspapers, when revenue was abundant and 'I-teams' were all the rage. But with nearly all papers hurt by cutbacks and some in bankruptcy, ambitions have often been downsized. And that has left a vacuum for ventures that don't have to worry about Wall Street expectations. Two years after setting up shop in lower Manhattan, ProPublica has earned substantial respect and a top-tier list of partners. The nonprofit has done nine stories with The Washington Post, 27 with the Los Angeles Times, eight with USA Today, six with the Chicago Tribune, six others with the New York Times, 13 with Politico and 10 with the Huffington Post. Other partners have included ABC, CNN, CNBC, '60 Minutes,' Newsweek, Salon, Slate and PBS's 'Frontline.' Gerald Marzorati, editor of the New York Times Magazine, says Fink first pitched the hospital story before she joined ProPublica. 'We as a magazine don't have the resources to pursue a story like that,' he says. 'So we sort of passed.' Once ProPublica got involved, the magazine worked with Fink through nearly a dozen drafts and provided fact-checking, legal reviews and photography. 'Our magazine editing machine was engaged in bringing this to publication for a long time,' Marzorati says. 'It was a real collaboration.' In some cases, Steiger says, ProPublica does all the reporting, and in others has shared the reporting load with the news outlets. More than half the joint efforts with The Post have featured bylines from both organizations, including such Steiger hires as former Post reporter Dafna Linzer and former New York Times correspondent Jeff Gerth. On Friday, The Post ran a front-page story by two ProPublica reporters on members of Congress holding fundraisers in luxury suites at Bruce Springsteen concerts. Some of ProPublica's work runs only on its Web site, which Steiger hopes to make more prominent so he is less dependent on outside media venues. For now, Steiger remains heavily dependent on Sandler's foundation, a situation that the San Francisco philanthropist calls unhealthy. Sandler and his wife, Marion, are major Democratic donors who have poured money into the liberal Center for American Progress and the American Civil Liberties Union. 'I don't know how democracy functions without strong investigative journalism,' Sandler says. In attempting to broaden its financial base, ProPublica raised $1 million last year mainly from foundations, a figure that includes about $200,000 from author Mary Graham, co-director of Harvard's Transparency Policy Project and the ex- wife of Post Co. chief executive Donald Graham. Marzorati says he would be 'wary' of media outfits underwritten by wealthy patrons: 'What happens when the rich guys start ordering up stories where they know what they want? The temptation for news organizations will be to get their hands on a big, sexy investigation.' While Sandler is ProPublica's chairman, he says none of the board members knows what the reporters are working on. 'We told them from the beginning, investigate everything. ... If we've done something, go after us,' he says. 'If anything's off-limits, it's not a legitimate newsroom.' But Sandler is not a fan of all reporting. He complained bitterly about a 2008 story that the New York Times did on him and his wife. The headline was 'Once Trusted Mortgage Pioneers, Now Pariahs.' When the couple ran World Savings Bank, the Times said, they championed an exotic mortgage later seen as 'the Typhoid Mary' of the industry, and Wachovia, which bought the bank, wound up with huge losses. Sandler said he did nothing wrong other than misjudge the housing bubble. The Times has defended its work but ran four corrections to the article. Clearly, Fink's work would not have been possible without Sandler's backing. She made repeated trips to New Orleans and around the country to examine allegations that doctors and nurses at Memorial Medical Center injected patients with lethal doses of drugs. 'It's a very sad, tragic story,' says Fink, who recently left ProPublica and moved to Washington to write a book on the subject. 'The newsroom was set up to invest in long-form, deep-dive investigative journalism,' she says. 'That was a huge luxury.' -0-< Katie Couric dealt with death in two very different ways last week. The CBS News anchor hosted a 'Sesame Street' prime-time special on the subject, embracing Elmo and talking to military and other families that have suffered a loss about dealing with their children. Couric's husband, Jay Monahan, died in 1998. 'Having been there _ having a 6- and 2-year-old at the time _ and wishing I had more resources available to me, I thought this was something that could help other families,' she says. For herself, 'whenever you're talking about loss, it does uncover those feelings that have healed partially. I just felt I was in a position where I'd have complete empathy for these families that were profiled.' Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called to thank Couric for making the program after a Pentagon screening. Couric also aired an 'Evening News' piece from Haiti in which she focused on a 13-year-old boy, Pierre, who lost his parents in the earthquake there. On her first trip to Port-au-Prince after the disaster, the teenager was seen screaming while doctors worked on his broken leg, and although he is recovering, the earthquake destroyed his school. 'There are a million stories like Pierre's,' Couric says. 'Because he made such an impact, not just for me but for viewers, with his piercing cries of anguish, he really captured the pain of an entire country.' Colleagues say Couric was so moved she has decided to pay for Pierre's education. Not every part of her job is depressing. She got to hang with the 'slightly eccentric' Al Pacino for a '60 Minutes' profile that aired Sunday. Lately, says Couric, she's been 'exercising a lot of muscles.' "
1,"Panasonic Corp. said Monday that it had taken majority control of Sanyo Electric Co., officially forming one of the world's largest electronics makers. Panasonic said it had converted preferred shares to give it a 50.27 percent stake in Sanyo. It acquired the shares in a previously announced $4.6 billion tender offer that ended Dec. 9. The acquisition gives Panasonic access to Sanyo's advanced solar panel and rechargeable battery technology. But Panasonic must also find a way to bring profitability back to Sanyo, which had a net loss of 30.6 billion yen ($338 million) in the April-September half. Panasonic has said it will retain the well-known Sanyo brand and keep its shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Panasonic had reportedly hoped to take a larger stake in Sanyo, but the company had to settle with a minimum controlling stake, with some shareholders likely unwilling to sell at a tender offer that was lower than the market price. The deal was delayed for months while the companies awaited clearance from worldwide anti-monopoly authorities. In Monday trade, Sanyo shares were up 2.4 percent to 174 yen, while Panasonic fell 0.3 percent to 1,281 yen. "

1,"Europe's governments are struggling to deal with a mountain of debt made worse by the past three years of global financial and economic turmoil. Here are thumbnail sketches of how some of the countries involved are faring -- and what they're doing to escape the crisis. ITALY: 2009 debt: 115.8 percent of gross domestic product Deficit: 5.3 percent of GDP. 2010 growth estimate: 0.8 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.0 percent. Unemployment: 8.6 percent. Italy has piled up lots of debt but so far has been spared the troubles plaguing Greece. Bond markets are still willing to lend at affordable rates in the belief the country will make good on its debts. Still, rising market pressures on other countries has forced Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government to announce spending cuts to reassure bond investors the country's finances are under control. That surprised Italians after they had been assured for months by Berlusconi and his aides that Italy would escape the government crisis without painful measures. Berlusconi announced (EURO)25 billion ($30 billion) in budget cuts for 2011-2012 to reduce the deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP by 2012. The cuts target the country's bloated bureaucracy and aim to recoup some of the estimated (EURO)120 billion Italy loses to due widespread tax evasion. While welcoming the measures, Italy's main industrial lobby Confindustria said they don't do enough to spur Italy's perennially sluggish growth. ------ GREECE: 2009 debt: 115.1 percent of GDP. Deficit: 13.6 percent. Deficit projection for 2010: 8.1 percent. 2010 growth estimate: minus 4.0 percent. 2011 estimate: minus 2.6. Unemployment: 12.1 percent Europe's problem child, Greece spent itself into trouble with a bloated public sector and widespread tax evasion, then lied about the shape of its finances. In October, a new government shocked markets by announcing the debt was 12.5 percent of GDP, more than four times the previous government's estimate. It has subsequently revised up to 13.6 percent. Revelations that past governments had fudged statistics further undermined market confidence. As a result, bond markets hammered Greek debt and refused to lend to Greece at an affordable rate. Prime Minister George Papandreous's government was forced to take a (EURO)110 billion bailout from the eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting in May. Many economists think Greece will eventually have to restructure its debts despite the bailout because of its weak economic growth. Debt is projected to peak at 149.1 percent of GDP in 2013 before beginning to fall the following year. Greece faces the double challenge of massive debt, which stands at about 310 billion euros, and the harsh austerity measures imposed in order to release the eurozone-IMF rescue loans are expected to dampen consumer spending. With no particular industrial output to speak of, Greece is a heavily consumer-based economy, so the recession will further hamper the government's efforts to pull itself out of its debt crisis. Tourism, one of its main industries, is already suffering after television images of Greeks rioting over austerity plans. ------ BELGIUM: 2009 debt: 96.7 percent of GDP Deficit: 6 percent. 2010 growth estimate: 1.3 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.6 percent. Unemployment rate in March: 8.1 percent. Belgium's reliance on trade has hurt the economy in the last two years ago, but the recent recovery in European exports -- many routed through the busy port of Antwerp -- has helped the economy return to growth. However, the country's persistent budget deficits and uncertainty over political reforms that could transfer more power from the federal government to the regions mean that it may face problems curbing a debt mountain that will top 100 percent in 2011. ------ FRANCE: 2009 debt: 78.1 percent of GDP. Deficit: 7.5 percent of GDP. 2010 growth estimate: 1.4 percent. 2011 estimate: 2.5 percent. Unemployment: 10.1 percent. Five months after unveiling a euro 35 billion 'Big Loan' aimed at spurring France's moribund economy to life, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced this week that tackling 30 years of accumulated deficits is now a 'national priority.' A three-year spending freeze, combined with a crackdown on tax loopholes and other measures are now promised as a way of bringing France's deficit under the 3 percent threshold enshrined in EU rules by 2013. Of cource, Sarkozy once promised to achieve that by this year, but that was before the crisis. French government forecasts of 2.5 percent growth from 2011 onward are optimistic compared to estimate of only 1.7 percent growth from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a grouping of developed countries. ------ PORTUGAL: 2009 debt: 76.6 percent of GDP Deficit: 9.4 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 0.5 percent 2011 estimate: 0.9. percent Unemployment: 10.5. percent Portugal's economy, burdened by low education levels and labor laws that make hiring and firing difficult, has been struggling to get traction since the turn of the century, with growth averaging less than 1 percent since 2000. Traditional industries such as textiles and footwear have shrunk under global competition while tourism, which generates 10 percent of economic output and jobs, has slumped amid the global economic crisis. The minority center-left Socialist government is trying to develop high-tech sectors such as renewable energy but as a small country of 10.6 million people Portugal is dependent on growth in its European trading partners for an export recovery. It is also trying to increase trade with developing nations, especially Angola, its former colony, and Portuguese-speaking Brazil. The government predicts the national debt it will peak at 90.1 percent of GDP in 2012 before falling back. ------ GERMANY: 2009 debt: 73.2 percent of GDP Deficit: 3.3 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 1.4 percent 2011 estimate: 1.6 percent Unemployment: 8.1 percent Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, cut its budget deficit to zero in 2008 but then saw it return last year in the wake of the global financial crisis. The government says this year's deficit will be above 5 percent, but it has pledged to get back below 3 percent by 2013. The constitution has a 'debt brake' that forces the government to cut back borrowing over the coming years. Germany's recovery has been heavily reliant on exports, and domestic demand has been a weak point for years. Chancellor Angela Merkel started her second term last October pledging tax relief to boost the economy but her new center-right government delivered only a modest package of measures. Merkel pushed hard to make sure the European Union's bailout of Greece was accompanied by promises of harsh cutbacks, and some accused her of making the crisis worse by delaying. Bailing out Greece was unpopular at home, and Merkel's party suffered a state election defeat in May that deprived her government of a majority in the upper house of parliament. Merkel declared that further tax cuts won't be possible until 2013 and the emphasis will now be on keeping debt under control. She hasn't yet detailed possible spending cuts but has indicated that education will be spared. ------ IRELAND: 2009 debt: 65 percent of GDP. Deficit: 14.3 percent. 2010 growth estimate: minus 0.7 percent. 2011 estimate: 3.0 percent. Unemployment: 12.6 percent. Ireland enjoyed Europe's longest sustained growth from 1994 to 2007 amid unprecedented investment by foreign high-tech firms seeking a low-tax base in the European Union. But the Celtic Tiger boom collapsed amid the global credit crisis, which exposed the country's reckless reliance on foreign lending and property speculation to fuel spending. In its annual budget in December, Ireland slashed pay for state workers, cut welfare benefits and imposed new environmental taxes on fuel as part of a record (EURO)4 billion ($6 billion) in budget cuts to combat the runaway deficit. It was rewarded for the budgetary constraints with far lower market borrowing costs than Greece. The Irish government said recently it is on track to cut its deficit to be in line with the European Union's limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2014. ------ BRITAIN: 2009/10 estimated debt as percentage of GDP: 62 percent. Deficit: 10.4 percent. 2010 growth estimate: 1-1.5 percent. 2011 estimate: 3-3.5 percent. Unemployment: 8 percent. Public finances in Britain, which does not use the euro, have shown signs of slowing deterioration in recent months, but remain at record levels. Britain does have some advantages over countries like Greece: it prints the currency in which its liabilities are denominated, so it can devalue and make its exports more competitive. It is considered a surer bet for repayment, maintaining a triple-A credit rating. Still, the new coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party has made cutting debt its priority to get the country 'back open for business.' Britain was hit particularly hard by the global credit crunch because of its huge financial sector, and the government carried out a multibillion pound bailout of major banks even as levels of personal debt soared among consumers. Like the US, it also faced a collapsed real estate bubble. The European Union has warned that Britain's deficit is likely to hit 12 percent of GDP this year, four times what the bloc considers acceptable. Debt is expected to reach 88 percent in 2011 or 2012, overtaking the EU average. ------ NETHERLANDS: 2009 debt: 61 percent of GDP Deficit: 3.4 percent of GDP 2010 growth estimate: 1.5 percent. 2011 estimate: 2.0 percent. Unemployment: 5.9 percent. The Netherlands went into the financial crisis with the best national finances it had seen in decades, and all main parties committed to pruning the welfare state -- with different emphases. The country has a competitive, open economy, natural gas resources, and is a net exporter, especially of agricultural goods. But its unusually large financial services sector led to an abrupt spike in national debt largely due to bailouts during the crisis. Although the Dutch are in an anti-Europe mood and many would love to see the return of the guilder, policymakers recognize that but for its euro-membership, the Netherlands might well have wound up like Iceland and seen its currency and banking system collapse. Dutch national elections are scheduled for June 9, and major battlegrounds include whether the retirement age should be raised to 67 from 65 and whether to scrap the tax deduction on mortgage interest. Anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders is trying to halt a big slide in the polls by arguing that non-Western immigrants cost the country (EURO)7 billion per year. ------ SPAIN: 2009 debt: 55.2 percent of GDP Deficit: 11.2 percent of GDP 2010 growth: minus 0.3 percent. 2011 estimate: 1.3 percent. Unemployment: 20.05 percent. Spain is grappling with the twin woes of a moribund economy and a lopsided deficit that is triggering fears of a Greek-style debt crisis. The government has cut spending to chip away at the deficit, but acknowledged that this will also chop half a percentage point off its forecast for growth in 2011, down to 1.3 percent. And there are doubts over whether that level of growth can generate net employment and ease the 20 percent jobless rate. Before the economic crisis, Spain relied heavily on free-flowing credit and a red-hot construction sector. Now it is search of a new growth model and there are no obvious solutions. Business leaders and many economists say the government must reform the stodgy labor market to encourage employers to hire and restore a climate of confidence. ------ "
1,"Toyota admitted design problems with the brakes in its prized Prius, adding to the catalog of woes for the world's No. 1 automaker still reeling from a massive U.S. recall involving faulty gas pedals. Toyota Motor Corp. spokeswoman Ririko Takeuchi said Thursday that Toyota discovered there were design problems with the antilock brake system and corrected them for Prius models sold since late January, including those being shipped overseas. But the company said it was still investigating how to inform people who had bought the gas-electric hybrid cars. Nothing was decided on that front for Prius cars sold overseas, according to Toyota. Complaints about braking problems in the third-generation Prius have been reported in both the U.S. and Japan, combining to some 180, and come amid a global recall of nearly 4.5 million other top-selling vehicles for faulty gas pedals. 'We are investigating whether there are defects in the Prius,' Toyota executive Hiroyuki Yokoyama told reporters at Toyota's Tokyo. The company gave few details of the brake flaw. A major Toyota dealership in Tokyo said the automaker had informed dealers that Prius brakes can sometimes fail to work for less than a second but it had not told owners. 'It is disappointing because the Prius was receiving such rave reviews,' said Hiroyuki Naito, a manager at the dealership. The latest model Prius hit showrooms last May. The problem with the Prius -- the best-selling hybrid in the world and Toyota's flagship model -- is a big embarrassment for the automaker in its home turf Japan and another blow in the U.S., its biggest market. In recent weeks, the automaker had answered questions about its overseas recalls for gas pedals with assurances that problems didn't extend to Japanese vehicles, implying that it was doing a better job with quality control in Japan. The transport minister is ordering an investigation and said a recall for the Prius should be considered. U.S. authorities are also investigating. Earlier in Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood startled the public with a comment, which he later retracted, that Americans should park their recalled Toyotas unless driving to dealers for accelerator repairs. The popular gas-electric Prius was not part of the most recent recall over sticking gas pedals in eight top-selling models including the Camry that spanned the U.S., Europe and China. Toyota senior managing director Takahiro Ijichi defended the automaker's quality standards. 'We have not sacrificed the quality for the sake of saving costs,' he said. 'Quality is our lifeline. We want our customers to feel safe and regain their trust as soon as possible.' Toyota for the first time gave an estimate of the costs of the U.S. recall at up to $2 billion with $1.1 billion for the costs for the repairs and $770 million to $880 million in lost sales. The Prius, the world's best-selling hybrid, has been extremely popular in Japan because of government incentives that made hybrids tax-free. More than 170,000 the new remodeled Prius cars were sold in Japan and about 103,000 have been sold in the U.S. since May. Despite snowballing problems with quality, Toyota said Thursday it returned to profit in the October-December quarter because of healthy sales of its green models including the Prius, and raised its forecast for the fiscal year through March. Net profit for October-December was about $1.7 billion. It forecast a $880 million annual profit compared with its previous forecast for a $2.2 billion loss. Toyota also raised its full year sales outlook to 7.18 million units from 7.03 million. The revised forecast remains lower than the 7.57 million vehicles it sold last fiscal year. And it is unclear how well Toyota sales and profits will hold up in coming months. "
1,"The Obama administration's choice to lead the struggling Transportation Security Administration withdrew his name from consideration Wednesday, just weeks after revelations that he had provided misleading information to Congress prompted several Republicans to suggest his nomination would not move forward without a fight. Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent and homeland security specialist, was presented as a leader who would improve the TSA's sprawling operations and improve passenger screening to prevent such attacks as the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner. But GOP opposition to Southers escalated rapidly after The Washington Post reported that Southers had given Congress and the White House misleading information about incidents two decades ago in which he inappropriately accessed a federal database to obtain information about his estranged wife's new boyfriend, possibly in violation of privacy laws. In a statement released by the White House, Southers blamed congressional critics motivated by 'political ideology' for the troubles that overshadowed his nomination. 'It is apparent that this path has been obstructed by political ideology,' he said. 'My nomination has become a lightning rod for those who have chosen to push a political agenda at the risk of the safety and security of the American people. This partisan climate is unacceptable and I refuse to allow myself to remain part of their dialogue.' The withdrawal comes at a difficult time for the White House. The TSA has been leaderless for months and further delay was likely, as the Senate prepared for a procedural fight over holds placed on his nomination. Two weeks ago, seven Republican senators, including John McCain (Ariz.), Charles Grassley (Iowa) and Tom Coburn (Okla.), had demanded the White House provide more information about why Southers initially gave Congress an incorrect account about the long-ago searches, which led to his censure by the FBI. Their criticism followed on a hold on the nomination placed by Sen. Jim DeMint, who said he was concerned Southers would support the unionization of TSA workers. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, D-Nev., had promised to rally votes to overcome those holds and force the nomination through as early as Wednesday. But such a battle would have added to the political distractions caused by the outcome of Tuesday's special election in Massachusetts, in which Republican Scott Brown won a surprise victory to capture the seat long held by Sen. Edward Kennedy -- and deal a shocking blow to the Obama administration's domestic agenda by eroding the Democratic majority in the Senate. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said President Obama believes that Southers -- who has also served as a police officer, a senior official in the California governor's office of homeland security, assistant chief of homeland security and intelligence with the Los Angeles World Airports police department -- would have been 'an excellent TSA Administrator.' Shapiro said the president 'but understands (Southers's) personal decision and the choice he has made.' 'Southers was uniquely qualified for this job and it is with great sadness that the President accepted Southers' withdrawal. Fortunately the acting TSA Administrator is very able and we have a solid team of professionals at TSA doing vital national security work to keep us safe,' Shapiro said. The discrepancies in Southers' statements to Congress and the White House focused on incidents in 1987 and 1988 in which he inappropriately accessed a federal database. In an Oct. 22 affidavit provided to the Senate homeland security committee, Southers said he asked a San Diego police officer to access the records. In November, after the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), received a briefing about the censure letter and noticed discrepancies in Southers's account, she asked him to explain the episode. In a Nov. 20 letter, a day after the committee endorsed his nomination, Southers acknowledged that his first account was incorrect. He said that after reviewing documents, he realized he had twice personally conducted the database searches. Southers wrote that he was 'distressed by the inconsistencies between my recollection and the contemporaneous documents,' and he assured the committee that 'the mistake was inadvertent' and that he had accepted responsibility for what he acknowledged was a grave error in judgment many years ago. In a statement two weeks ago, a White House spokesman said officials did not know of the discrepancies in Southers's account until November, well into the nomination process. 'The important mission of the TSA will require a focused and determined leader,' Collins said Wednesday. 'It is critically important that the White House act quickly to nominate someone with qualifications and reputation which are beyond reproach to lead this agency.' "
1,"Rue McClanahan, who purred the role of a Southern-belle vixen not slowed by age on the celebrated television series 'The Golden Girls,' has died. She was 76. McClanahan, who suffered a stroke earlier this year, died in New York early Thursday morning, according to People magazine, citing her manager, Barbara Lawrence. In her portrayal of the libidinous widow Blanche Devereaux, the most romantically active of the four women sharing a Miami household in their golden years, McClanahan had a large part in establishing 'The Golden Girls' as a television show uniquely focused on the lives of older women. In one episode, Betty White's innocent Rose Nylund asked aloud, 'Is it possible to love two men at one time?' To which McClanahan's Blanche replied, 'Set the scene -- have we been drinking?' 'The Golden Girls' was a ratings leader on NBC in its seven-season run, from 1985 to 1992. McClanahan won the 1987 Emmy Award for lead actress in a comedy series and was nominated three other times. White, Getty and Beatrice Arthur each also won the outstanding lead actress Emmy during the show's run, and the show was named outstanding comedy twice. White is now the only surviving Golden Girl. Arthur died in 2009, at 86, and Getty died in 2008, at 84. For McClanahan, the show culminated an acting career on Broadway and on television, in daytime soap operas and sitcoms including 'Maude,' on which she had a recurring role as the best friend of Maude Findlay, played by Arthur. Married six times, McClanahan revealed in her 2007 memoir that the insatiable appetites of her 'Golden Girls' character weren't a terrible stretch for her. 'People always ask if I'm really like Blanche,' McClanahan wrote, 'and I say, `Well, consider the facts: Blanche was a glamorous, oversexed, self-involved, man-crazy Southern belle from Atlanta -- and I'm not from Atlanta.' She also wrote: 'I learned a lot from Blanche about optimism and joie de vivre, feeling confident about what you have to offer the world, and the ability to bounce back from life's momentary failures. Blanche Devereaux is a masterful rebounder, never down for the count, always back up to fight again, to look again on the bright side. I loved that about her.' Eddi-Rue McClanahan was born on Feb. 21, 1934, in Healdton, Okla., where she learned to dance and performed in school productions. Her father, William, was a building contractor. Her mother, Rhuea, owned a beauty shop. She majored in German and theater arts at the University of Tulsa and moved to New York City after graduation to study acting. Her first job was at the Erie Playhouse in Erie, Pa. She married for the first time and had her only child, son Mark, then returned to her family in Oklahoma when the marriage ended. She landed her first film roles in the early 1960s after returning to New York, found work on Broadway, and in 1970 landed a role on the soap opera 'Another World.' After producer Norman Lear gave her a guest role on an episode of 'All in the Family,' he cast her for the recurring role on 'Maude.' After that series ended in 1978, Lear gave McClanahan the lead role in the short-lived sitcom 'Apple Pie.' A recurring role in 'Mama's Family' followed. After the success of 'The Golden Girls,' McClanahan joined Getty and White in a spinoff, 'The Golden Palace,' which ran 24 episodes. An animal-rights activist, McClanahan served as an honorary director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She was diagnosed in 1997 with breast cancer and underwent successful treatment. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: When then-U.S. Attorney Richard Cullen, a Republican, gave vigorous support in 1993 to Virginia limiting the purchase of handguns to one a month, some people questioned the propriety of a federal prosecutor getting involved in a state legislative matter. But Mr. Cullen believed that it was his duty to speak out because the gun running made possible by Virginia's lax laws was a national problem. That is just as true today _ and it's why the Obama administration should find its voice and help prevent a repeal of this invaluable law. The Republican-led House of Delegates has already voted to repeal the 17-year- old ban on buying more than one handgun a month. The Senate Courts of Justice committee is set to consider the bill, and, though the committee is controlled by Democrats, the outcome is by no means certain. The effort to undo the ban was fueled during last year's gubernatorial campaign when both candidates said that they would sign a repeal. Gov. Robert F. McDonnell, R, who voted for the ban when he was a member of the House, says that he has changed his mind. Mr. McDonnell and other supporters of repeal offer the feeble argument that new technology, which allows instant background checks on gun buyers, makes the law obsolete. What they overlook is how straw purchasers, residents with no criminal backgrounds who can lawfully purchase firearms, serve as front men for criminals who come to the state to buy guns in large quantities. It's a system that, to use Mr. Cullen's phrase, made Virginia 'an embarrassment' and contributed to the violence that is the hallmark of drug gangs. Research has shown that the gun-a-month limit has reduced _ by as much as half _ the number of Virginia firearms recovered in cities such as New York. And we're not aware of any big problems that resulted from buyers being able to obtain only 12 handguns a year. Our inquiries to the current U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, as well as to the Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as to their thoughts on what a repeal might mean to national and international crime fighting either fell on deaf ears or elicited a response that the administration wouldn't involve itself in local matters. It seems that this is an administration that has been cowed by the political implications of taking on the national gun lobby. The Obama administration needs to listen to what Mr. Cullen said 17 years ago: 'It is my responsibility to get involved ... I owe it to the beat cops ... and to the thousands of law enforcement officials who put their lives in harm's way each day.' And it needs to finally speak out to help Virginia Democrats kill this misguided repeal. "
1,"The White House says President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama have expressed satisfaction with plans to move a U.S. Marine base to a less crowded part of the Japanese island of Okinawa. Obama and Hatoyama spoke in a telephone conversation on Thursday as the president was flying to Chicago. Details of their conversation came as Washington and Tokyo issued a joint statement outlining a new agreement on keeping the base on the island of Okinawa. Hatoyama's decision disappointed many of the island's residents, who complain about base-related noise, pollution and crime. The White House also says Obama and Hatoyama pledged to work closely with South Korea after a North Korean torpedo reportedly sank its neighbor's ship. "
1,"Drugstore operators are beginning their seasonal flu shot campaigns several weeks early this year, saying they expect greater demand for the vaccine in a year when the swine flu strain has dominated the news. CVS Caremark Corp. and Walgreen Co. are making flu shots available starting Tuesday, while Rite Aid Corp. said some of its pharmacists are already giving the shots. The vaccine is intended to prevent the seasonal flu and is separate from vaccines for swine flu. A swine flu vaccine could be ready by mid-October. CVS said it was offering the shots three or four weeks earlier than usual. Walgreen said it started giving flu shots Oct. 1 last year. CVS and Walgreen each run about 6,900 stores around the country, while Rite Aid has about 4,800. Walgreen said the shots will be available at almost all of its stores and about 350 of its Take Care retail clinics, and CVS said it will give the shots at scheduled events in many of its stores and at all 500 of its walk-in MinuteClinics. Pharmacists at about 1,500 Rite Aid stores will be able to give the vaccination. Walgreen pharmacies and clinics will have an immunizing pharmacist on duty daily from Sept. 8 to Sept. 30. Starting Sept. 15, CVS said it will hold more than 9,000 'flu shot clinic events' at its stores, where pharmacists or other health care workers will give the injections. Rite Aid, which is based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, will run clinics at more than 1,800 of its stores starting Sept. 23. CVS and Rite Aid will post schedules of the clinics on their Web sites. CVS, of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, will also give away 100,000 free seasonal flu shots to unemployed people. The company will give out vouchers for the free shots at certain One-Stop Career Centers, which are sponsored by the Labor Department. The shots will be administered at CVS pharmacies and MinuteClinics. The locations and dates of the offer have not been determined. CVS said the free shots will cost it about $3 million. Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen is giving out $1 million worth of vaccine to people with no insurance. It will send nine tour buses to select markets nationwide with employees distributing vouchers for the vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for children, the elderly, caregivers, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems or many other chronic health problems. According to a Walgreen survey, 50 percent of consumers are planning to get the shot this year, up from 43 percent in 2008. Dr. Troyen Brennan, CVS's Chief Medical Officer, said most of the experts he has spoken to are expecting greater demand for the vaccine this year because of the swine flu pandemic. Several companies are testing swine flu vaccines, which may be administered as one shot or two. The flu shot contains flu virus particles that are already dead, the CDC says, so it is not possible to get the flu from the vaccine. According to the agency, about 226,000 Americans are hospitalized with the flu each year, and about 36,000 die. "
1,"Six months into Barack Obama's presidency, twin investigations may be on the horizon into Bush-era policies in the war on terror. Two senators including the head of the intelligence committee suggested Sunday that the prior administration broke the law by concealing a CIA counter-terrorism program from Congress. The assertion that Vice President Dick Cheney ordered the concealment came amid word that Attorney General Eric Holder is contemplating opening a criminal probe of possible CIA torture. A move to appoint a criminal prosecutor is certain to stir partisan bickering that could prove a distraction to Obama's efforts to push ambitious health care and energy reform. Obama has repeatedly expressed reluctance to probing alleged Bush-era abuses. He resisted an effort by congressional Democrats to establish a 'truth commission,' saying the U.S. should be 'looking forward and not backwards.' Regarding the 8-year-old counter-terrorism program, the Bush administration's failure to notify Congress 'is a big problem, because the law is very clear,' said Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. Congress should investigate the secrecy because 'it could be illegal,' Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said. According to Feinstein, CIA director Leon Panetta told Congress late last month that Cheney ordered the program not be revealed to Congress. 'We were kept in the dark. That's something that should never, ever happen again,' said Feinstein. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said he agreed with Feinstein that the CIA should keep Congress informed. However, Cornyn said the new disclosure 'looks to me suspiciously like an attempt to provide political cover' to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats. Pelosi has accused the CIA of lying to her in 2002 about its use of waterboarding, or simulated drowning. Feinstein and Cornyn spoke on 'Fox News Sunday.' Durbin appeared on ABC television's 'This Week.' "

1,"The International Cricket Council wants to send an invitational World XI to play in Pakistan to end the country's sporting isolation following a terror attack on the Sri Lankan team. The ICC said Tuesday that it hopes fixtures could be played in Pakistan by the end of 2011, but it is still assessing the security situation and the availability of players. 'World cricket must go back and play in Pakistan,' said Giles Clarke, who heads the task force set up by the ICC in 2009 to help Pakistan fulfill its international cricket commitments. But Clarke, unveiling the plans in the September issue of The Wisden Cricketer magazine, wrote that it was still too early for a national team to return to Pakistan. 'The security challenges are enormous but we cannot allow the terrorists to win,' Clarke said. 'With determination and courage an ICC World XI in due course will go and play against Pakistan in her great cities and there will be a marvelous atmosphere.' An All Star team could be more easily protected because it would undertake fewer matches in fewer venues than a national team. Cricket tours of Pakistan were abandoned after the Sri Lankan team's bus was attacked by gunmen en route to a match venue at Lahore on March 9 last year. Six police officers and a van driver in the team's convoy were killed. Sri Lankan players and officials were injured. The ICC also removed Pakistan as one of the four planned hosts for the 2011 World Cup, which will be staged in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka starting in February. Pakistan has staged its scheduled home series at neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates and England in the interim, but Clarke said it was important to take the game back to the Pakistan people. 'Cricket cannot abandon a nation with such a magnificent history in the game, such wonderful players and such enthusiastic and knowledgeable supporters,' Clarke wrote. 'It will be an historic moment when international cricket resumes in Pakistan and the first ICC team walks out.' Clarke said the Pakistan Cricket Board's income had dropped by two-thirds since the attack, describing it as 'a brutal impact that few enterprises could survive.' In a 120-page report sent to the ICC, a high-ranking judge who reviewed the attack for the Pakistan government heavily criticized senior police for being ill-prepared and poorly equipped at the time of the attack.

1,"Sally Pearson of Australia began her latest quest for a Commonwealth Games gold medal Sunday, reaching the final of the 100-meter hurdles three days after being disqualified after finishing first in the 100. Pearson easily won her heat at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in 13.02 seconds, the fastest time of the day. 'I was a bit wobbly today, but it was good to run the cobwebs out,' Pearson said. On Thursday, Pearson crossed the line first in the 100 in 11.28 seconds, but she and Laura Turner of England were disqualified for a false start several hours later after a protest from the England team. Osayomi Oludamola of Nigeria was instead awarded gold. 'I was silly,' Pearson said of the false start. 'I was not relaxed and not focused on my own game. I didn't breath and stay relaxed. That's what I have to do in the hurdles final.' Oludamola ran in the semifinals of the 200 on Sunday, but failed to advance after finishing fourth in her heat with a time of 23.95 seconds. Eleni Artymata of Cyprus had the best time of 23.15 in the opening heat. In the men's 200, Leon Baptiste of England had the best time of 20.42 to advance to Sunday's final. Christian Malcolm was second fastest in 20:53. There were nine finals scheduled for Sunday, including the men's and women's 400 hurdles and the men's 800. The first medal went to Kurt Fearnley of Australia, who won the men's parasport 1,500 in 3:19.86. Teammate Richard Colman was second in 3:20.90 and Josh Cassidy of Canada took bronze in 3:21.14. "
1,"Dimitar Berbatov's double allowed Manchester United to strengthen its grip on the Premier League lead with a convincing 2-0 victory on Sunday over a depleted Sunderland. The Bulgaria striker nodded Wayne Rooney's lofted cross into the net after five minutes and also hit the post during a first-half onslaught. Berbatov was on target again -- slightly fortuitously -- when a 57th-minute strike deflected off Sunderland defender Anton Ferdinand past goalkeeper Craig Gordon. Unbeaten in the league all season, United has a two-point lead -- and two games in hand -- over crosstown rival Manchester City, which won 3-1 at Newcastle. Arsenal is five points behind United in third having played the same number of matches as the leaders. "
1,"Defending champion Bordeaux moved back to the top of the French league by beating Le Mans 3-0 on Saturday, while Lyon slumped to a second consecutive league defeat with a surprising 4-1 loss at struggling Nice. Bordeaux, which had lost its two previous league games, has 22 points, one more than Monaco. Promoted Montpellier was at Rennes, which had the best defensive record with six goals conceded, later Saturday with a possibility of being alone in first place. Lyon, which won at Liverpool in the Champions League in midweek, fell to fourth place with 20 points after its worst loss since a 5-2 defeat at Barcelona in the first knockout stage in last season's Champions League. After a good opening spell, Nice broke the deadlock in the 17th when Mamadou Bagayoko got the better of Lyon defender Cris in the area and headed home from Loic Remy's cross. Lyon had most of the possession, but Nice doubled the lead when Aly Cissokho scored an own-goal in the 39th. Remy ran down the right flank and delivered a low cross that was deflected in by the Lyon defender past goalkeeper Remi Vercoutre. Nice midfielder David Hellebuyck slotted home in the 69th with an angled shot, and Remy completed the rout in the 74th. Ederson salvaged some pride for Lyon with a consolation goal in the 82nd. Nice climbed from second last to 14th with 11 points. Following its 2-1 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League, Bordeaux took the lead when Le Mans goalkeeper Didier Ovono scored an own-goal in the fourth minute. Yoan Gouffran's strike hit the post and then Ovono before crossing the line. Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh found the net for the first time since Aug. 15 with a powerful header from a corner in the 67th, and David Bellion scored from close range in the 83rd after being left unmarked in the box. Monaco rose to second place with a 3-1 win at promoted Boulogne, and Sochaux claimed its third consecutive win by beating Lorient 1-0 to move to eighth. Sochaux defender Damien Perquis' seventh-minute header from a free kick beat goalkeeper Fabien Audard. Goals from Johan Audel and David Ducourtioux gave Valenciennes a 2-0 win at Saint-Etienne, and last-place Grenoble lost its 10th consecutive game with a 2-1 home loss to Nancy. On Sunday, Marseille will host fierce rival Paris Saint-Germain, which will be without some players due to swine flu after being diagnosed Saturday. The club didn't reveal the players' identities, but RTL radio said they are midfielder Ludovic Giuly and defender Mamadou Sakho. Marseille trails Bordeaux by five points, while PSG lags well behind in 11th place after three draws and two losses in its last five games. In Sunday's other matches, Lens hosts Toulouse and Lille is at Auxerre. "
1,"If a modern day Deep Throat phones The Post with a hot news tip, will the message get through? Last month, a reader called to complain that he had been unable to alert the newsroom to a killing in Southeast. He'd telephoned The Post's main number the previous day, he said, but 'gave up' after listening to a lengthy recorded list of options that failed to include local news. Inexplicably, the menu offers access to more than 20 departments _ everything from death notices to foreign news _ but doesn't mention the sprawling Metro section. It's The Post's largest news staff, responsible for all local coverage. The anecdote points to a growing challenge. Through e-mail, online commenting and social networking, The Post has never had greater interaction with its audience. But increasingly, readers are complaining that when they most need to communicate with The Post, it's simply too difficult. It's not just news tips. In recent months, scores have contacted the ombudsman in frustration because they couldn't find a way to notify The Post's Web site about problems with content. Most weren't aware of the tiny 'Help' link at the bottom of each page, which invites them to 'Submit a Ticket' to a service desk. But when a photo and caption are mismatched, or a story link is broken, that isn't fast enough. About a week ago, Diana Kunkel expressed irritation after scouring the Web site for a way to report that an editorial page link hadn't been updated. She ended up phoning The Post's main number, she said, but 'there was no `web master.' And when I was forwarded to the operator, I was disconnected.' Mary Jo Comer had a similar complaint last week after trying to tell the Web staff that two stories in that morning's newspaper weren't showing up online. 'Why is there no easy way to let the appropriate persons know when a glitch occurs?' she asked. Many readers have also complained that the Web site doesn't offer an effortless way to report journalistic errors. They're right. A small 'corrections' link appears under the site's 'News' section. But it provides only an address for e-mailing correction requests (corrections@washpost.com), or encourages readers to phone The Post's main number and 'ask to be connected to the desk involved.' Many have told me the process is simply too cumbersome. When readers somehow manage to get a message to The Post's Universal Desk, which processes all print and Web content, editors are quick to correct obvious errors online. But requests submitted through the normal e-mail address can linger for days before a decision is made on whether a correction should appear in the paper, which would automatically trigger a correction online. In an era when inaccurate information can go viral, that delay is unacceptable. Senior Editor Milton Coleman, who oversees corrections, acknowledged the problem and said a remedy is in the works to 'streamline' the process so that 'many, if not most, corrections will be made online before we make them in the newspaper.' The Post also should consider providing online readers with a more prominent link to report errors or technical glitches. Editors could be immediately alerted if every page on the site clearly displayed a link urging readers to 'Report problems on this page.' Raju Narisetti, the managing editor who oversees The Post's online operations, said ideas such as these are being considered as part of a Web site redesign that is under way. He said a recent spike in reader complaints might be due partly to a 'significant uptick' in online traffic. Replacing 'aging technology' and redesigning the site 'should help reduce the current dissonance,' he added. The Post also should make it simple for readers to offer news tips. Like other newspapers, it should establish a dedicated 24-hour 'tip hotline' phone number. Its Web site should provide a simple one-click icon for sending tips. And a number should be established for texting tips. All should be prominently displayed in the newspaper and on the site. To survive amid today's cutthroat media competition, Post customers need to be king. Those who can't easily communicate with the Web site will quickly shift their loyalty. Those who can't relay a news tip will go elsewhere. By the way, The Post did finally report that homicide in Southeast. A short story appeared online more than a day later. And the paper carried the story a day after that. But by then, it wasn't really 'news.' Alexander is ombudsman for The Washington Post. "

1,"A European ruling banning crucifixes in Italian schools should be overturned, nine European governments said in an appeal Wednesday. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that crucifixes in Italian public schools violate religious and education freedoms last November. The case, part of a larger debate over the role of religious symbols in public places, has sharpened divisions between secular and religious advocacy groups. Italian courts have previously ruled that the display of crucifixes is part of Italian national identity and not an attempt at conversion, an argument expanded by New York University legal scholar Joseph Weiler on behalf of the governments of Italy, Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, San Marino, Romania and Russia, who are appealing the ruling. The decisions of the court -- an arm of the Council of Europe, the continent's premier human rights watchdog -- are binding on the council's 47 member states and therefore have an impact far beyond Italy. 'The democratic cohesion of society is dependent on the ability to uphold national symbols around which all society can coalesce,' Weiler said. 'It would be a strange (if Italy) had to abandon national symbols, and strip from its cultural identikit, any symbol which also had a religious significance.' Crucifixes are commonly displayed in Italian schools and public places. In its Nov. 3 ruling, the European court said the crucifix could be disturbing to non-Christian or atheist pupils. It added that state-run schools must 'observe confessional neutrality in the context of public education,' where attendance is compulsory. The original case was heard by a seven-judge panel. The appeal hearing was heard by a 'grand chamber' of 19 judges, indicating the tribunal believes the case deals with an important issue. The case was brought by Soile Lautsi, a mother of two who claimed public schools in her northern Italian town refused eight years ago to remove the Roman Catholic symbols from classrooms. She said the crucifix violates the secular principles the public schools are supposed to uphold, and the right to offer her children a secular education. She filed her case with the European Court of Human Rights in July 2006, after Italy's Constitutional Court dismissed her complaint. Elsewhere in Europe, strongly secular France, where crucifixes are not seen in public schools, banned students from wearing 'conspicuous' religious symbols in a law seen as aimed at Muslim headscarves. France, Belgium and Spain are considering limits on face-covering Muslim veils as well. "
1,"Home to a dozen truck stops and a few hundred family farms bounded by miles of foreboding desert, this hamlet in southwestern Afghanistan is far from a strategic priority for senior officers at the international military headquarters in Kabul. One calls Delaram, a day's drive from the nearest city, 'the end of the Earth.' Another deems the area 'unrelated to our core mission' of defeating the Taliban by protecting Afghans in their cities and towns. U.S. Marine commanders have a different view of the dusty, desolate landscape that surrounds Delaram. They see controlling this corner of remote Nimruz province as essential to promoting economic development and defending the more populated parts of southern Afghanistan. The Marines are constructing a vast base on the outskirts of town that will have two airstrips, an advanced combat hospital, a post office, a large convenience store and rows of housing trailers stretching as far as the eye can see. By this summer, more than 3,000 Marines _ one-tenth of the additional troops authorized by President Barack Obama in December _ will be based here. With Obama's July 2011 deadline to begin reducing U.S. forces looming over the horizon, the Marines have opted to wage the war in their own way. 'If we're going to succeed here, we have to experiment and take risks,' said Brig. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, the top Marine commander in Afghanistan. 'Just doing what everyone else is doing isn't going to cut it.' The Marines are pushing into previously ignored Taliban enclaves. They have set up a first-of-its-kind school to train police officers. They have brought in a Muslim chaplain to pray with local mullahs and deployed teams of female Marines to reach out to Afghan women. The Marine approach _ creative, aggressive and, at times, unorthodox _ has won many admirers within the military. The Marine emphasis on patrolling by foot and interacting with the population, which has helped to turn former insurgent strongholds along the Helmand River valley into reasonably stable communities with thriving bazaars and functioning schools, is hailed as a model of how U.S. forces should implement counterinsurgency strategy. But the Marines' methods, and their insistence that they be given a degree of autonomy not afforded to U.S. Army units, also have riled many up the chain of command in Kabul and Washington, prompting some to refer to their area of operations in the south as 'Marineistan.' They regard the expansion in Delaram and beyond as contrary to the population-centric approach embraced by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, and they are seeking to impose more control over the Marines. The U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, recently noted that the international security force in Afghanistan feels as if it comprises 42 nations instead of 41 because the Marines act so independently from other U.S. forces. 'We have better operational coherence with virtually all of our NATO allies than we have with the U.S. Marine Corps,' said a senior Obama administration official involved in Afghanistan policy. Some senior officials at the White House, at the Pentagon and in McChrystal's headquarters would rather have many of the 20,000 Marines who will be in Afghanistan by summer deploy around Kandahar, the country's second-largest city, to assist in a U.S. campaign to wrest the area from Taliban control instead of concentrating in neighboring Helmand province and points west. According to an analysis conducted by the National Security Council, fewer than 1 percent of the country's population lives in the Marine area of operations. They question whether a large operation that began last month to flush the Taliban out of Marja, a poor farming community in central Helmand, is the best use of Marine resources. Although it has unfolded with fewer than expected casualties and helped to generate a perception of momentum in the U.S.-led military campaign, the mission probably will tie up two Marine battalions and hundreds of Afghan security forces until the summer. 'What the hell are we doing?' the senior official said. 'Why aren't all 20,000 Marines in the population belts around Kandahar city right now? It's (Taliban leader) Mullah Omar's capital. If you want to stuff it to Mullah Omar, you make progress in Kandahar. If you want to communicate to the Taliban that there's no way they're returning, you show progress in Kandahar.' Until earlier this month, McChrystal lacked operational control over the Marines, which would have allowed him to move them to other parts of the country. That power rested with a three-star Marine general at the U.S. Central Command. He and other senior Marine commanders insisted that Marines in Afghanistan have a contiguous area of operations _ effectively precluding them from being split up and sent to Kandahar _ because they think it is essential the Marines are supported by Marine helicopters and logistics units, which are based in Helmand, instead of relying on the Army. After concern about the arrangement reached the White House, Gen. David Petraeus, who heads the Central Command, issued an order in early March giving McChrystal operational control of Marine forces in Afghanistan, according to senior defense officials. But the new authority vested in McChrystal _ the product of extensive negotiations among military lawyers _ still requires Marine approval for any plan to disaggregate infantry units from air and logistics support, which will limit his ability to move them, the defense officials said. 'At the end of the day, not a lot has changed,' said a Marine general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as did several other senior officers and officials, to address sensitive command issues. 'There's still a caveat that prevents us from being cherry-picked.' Marine commanders note that they did not choose to go to Helmand _ they were asked to go there by McChrystal's predecessor, Gen. David McKiernan, because British forces in the area were unable to contain the intensifying insurgency. But once they arrived, they became determined to show they could rescue the place, in much the same way they helped to turn around Anbar province in Iraq. The Marine concentration in one part of the country _ as opposed to Army units, which are spread across Afghanistan _ has yielded a pride of place. As it did in Anbar, the Corps is sending some of its most talented young officers to Helmand. The result has been a degree of experimentation and innovation unseen in most other parts of the country. Although they account for half of the Afghan population, women had been avoided by military forces, particularly in the conservative south, because it is regarded as taboo for women to interact with males with whom they are not related. In an effort to reach out to them, the Marines have established 'female engagement teams.' Made up principally of female Marines who came to Afghanistan to work in support jobs, the teams accompany combat patrols and seek to sit down with women in villages. Working with female translators, team members answer questions, dispense medical assistance and identify reconstruction needs. The Marines have sought to jump into another void by establishing their own police academy at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand instead of waiting for the U.S. military's national training program to provide recruits. The Marines also are seeking to do something that the military has not been able to do on a national scale: reduce police corruption by accepting only recruits vouched for by tribal elders. Then there's what Marines call the 'mullahpalooza tour.' Although most U.S. military units have avoided direct engagement with religious leaders in Afghanistan, Nicholson has brought over Lt. Cmdr. Abuhena Saifulislam, one of only two imams in the U.S. Navy, to spend a month meeting _ and praying with _ local mullahs, reasoning that the failure to interact with them made it easier for them to be swayed by the Taliban. In December, columns of Marine armored vehicles punched into the city of Now Zad in northern Helmand. Once the second-largest town in the province, it had been almost completely emptied of its residents over the past four years as insurgents mined the roads and buildings with hundreds of homemade bombs. Successive units of British and U.S. troops had been largely confined to a Fort Apache-like base in the town. Every time they ventured out, they'd be shot at or bombed. To Nicholson and his commanders, reclaiming the town, which the Marines accomplished within a few weeks, has been a crucial step in demonstrating to Helmand residents that U.S. forces are committed to getting rid of the Taliban. To other military officials in Afghanistan, however, the mission seemed contrary to McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy. 'If our focus is supposed to be protecting the population, why are we focusing on a ghost town?' said a senior officer at the NATO regional headquarters in Kandahar. Nicholson notes that Helmand's governor supported the operation, as did many local tribal leaders. Hundreds of residents have returned in recent weeks, and at least 65 shops have reopened, according to Marine officers stationed in Now Zad. 'Protecting the population means allowing people to return to their homes,' he said. 'We've taken a grim, tough place, a place where there was no hope, and we've given it a future.' Nicholson now wants Marine units to push through miles of uninhabited desert to establish control of a crossing point for insurgents, drugs and weapons on the border with Pakistan. And he wants to use the new base in Delaram to mount more operations in Nimruz, a part of far southwestern Afghanistan deemed so unimportant that it is one of the only provinces where there is no U.S. or NATO reconstruction team. 'This is a place where the enemy are moving in numbers,' he said, referring to increased Taliban activity along a newly built highway that bisects the province. 'We need to clean it up.' "
1,"Police ringed China's iconic Tiananmen Square on Thursday as the government blocked any attempts to mark the 20th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy activists. An exiled protest leader -- famous for publicly haranguing one of China's top leaders 20 years ago -- was also blocked from returning home to confront officials over what he called the 'June 4 massacre.' Foreign journalists were barred from the vast square as uniformed and plainclothes police stood guard across the vast plaza that was the epicenter of the student-led movement that was crushed by the military on the night of June 3-4, 1989. Security officials also blocked foreign TV camera operators and photographers from covering the raising of China's national flag, which happens at dawn every day. The heavy security moves come after government censors shut down social networking and image-sharing Web sites such as Twitter and Flickr, blacked out CNN when it airs stories on Tiananmen. Dissidents were confined to their homes or forced to leave Beijing, part of sweeping efforts to prevent online debate or organized commemorations of the anniversary. In another sign of the government's unwavering hard-line stance toward the protests, the second most-wanted student leader from 1989 said he had been denied entry to the southern Chinese territory of Macau. Wu'er Kaixi, in exile since fleeing China after the crackdown, traveled to Macau on Wednesday to turn himself in to authorities in a bid to return home. Immigration officers pulled him aside and demanded he fly back to Taiwan, something he vowed to resist. 'I'm just waiting. I'm guessing they're waiting for instructions from their superiors,' Wu'er told The Associated Press by phone, adding he was being detained in a small room guarded by a lone official at the Macau airport's immigration offices. 'If they disagree with my behavior, they can arrest me. I can accept that,' he said. 'But I won't let them deport me.' Wu'er rose to fame in 1989 as a pajama-clad hunger striker yelling at then-premier Li Peng at a televised meeting during the protests. Named No. 2 on the government's list of 21 most-wanted student leaders after the crackdown, he escaped and now lives in exile in the self-ruled island of Taiwan. An attempt to return home in 2004 was rebuffed when he was deported from the Chinese territory of Hong Kong. Wu'er said in a statement issued through a friend that he wants to turn himself in to the Chinese authorities so he can visit his parents -- who haven't been allowed to leave China. 'When I turn myself in, I will use the platform of a Chinese courtroom to debate the Chinese government about this incident,' he said. 'My turning myself in should not be interpreted as my admission that my behavior 20 years ago is illegal and wrong. I want to reassert here the Chinese government bears complete and undeniable moral, political and legal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in China in 1989,' his statement said. 'I hope, 20 years later, the Chinese government can set a new position on the historical problem of the 'June 4 massacre,' admit its guilt and apologize to the Chinese people,' he said. The student leader who topped the most-wanted list, Wang Dan, was jailed for seven years before being expelled to the United States in 1998. Beijing has never allowed an independent investigation into the military's crushing of the protests, in which possibly thousands of students, activists and ordinary citizens were killed. Young Chinese know little about the events, having grown up in a generation that has largely eschewed politics in favor of nationalism and economic development. Authorities have been tightening surveillance of China's dissident community ahead of the anniversary, with some leading writers already under close watch or house arrest for months. Ding Zilin, a retired professor and advocate for Tiananmen victims, said by telephone that a dozen officers blocked her and her husband from leaving their Beijing apartment Wednesday. 'They won't even allow me to go out and buy vegetables,' said Ding, whose teenage son was killed in the crackdown. 'They've been so ruthless to us that I am utterly infuriated,' she said. The blocking of social networking sites marked a new chapter in China's attempts to muzzle dissent and control information, showing the burgeoning influence of such technology among young Chinese. Authorities targeted message boards on more than 6,000 Web sites affiliated with colleges and universities, along with Chinese mini-blogging site Fanfou and video sharing site VeryCD. Notices on their home pages said they would be closed through Saturday for 'technical maintenance.' The video site YouTube has been blocked in China since March. Jason Khoury, spokesman for Yahoo, which owns Flickr, said no explanation had been given and the company believed the restrictions were 'inconsistent with the right to freedom of expression.' Officials from Twitter did not comment. In Hong Kong, where the anniversary is openly commemorated, a second dissident who took part in the 1989 events was denied entry to the territory. U.S. Consulate General spokesman Dale Kreisher said the decision to deport Xiang Xiaoji, an American citizen, was 'particularly regrettable in light of Hong Kong's well-known reputation as an open society.' Xiang had planned to attend Hong Kong's annual candlelight vigil for victims of the crackdown. ------ Associated Press writer Min Lee in Hong Kong contributed to this report. "
1,"Text of President Barack Obama's speech at Cairo University, as provided by CQ Transcriptions. ------ Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, al-Azhar has, had stood as a beacon of Islamic learning. And for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt's advancement. Together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress. I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'm also proud to carry with me the good will of the American people and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: Assalamu Alaikum. (APPLAUSE) We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation but also conflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims and a Cold War in which Muslim majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam. Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of Muslims. The attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries but also to human rights. All this has bred more fear and more mistrust. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end. I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, they overlap and share common principles, principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings. I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point. But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground. As the holy Quran tells us: 'Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.' (APPLAUSE) That is what I will try to do today, to speak the truth as best I can. Humbled by the task before us and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart. Now, part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian. But my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk. As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith. As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam at places like al-Azhar that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities... (APPLAUSE) It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires, timeless poetry and cherished music, elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality. (APPLAUSE) I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco. In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second president, John Adams, wrote: 'The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Muslims.' And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States. They have fought in our wars. They have served in our government. They have stood for civil rights. They have started businesses. They have taught at our universities. They've excelled in our sports arenas. They've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building and lit the Olympic torch. And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same holy Quran that one of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, kept in his personal library. (APPLAUSE) So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear. (APPLAUSE) But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as... (APPLAUSE) Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words, within our borders and around the world. We are shaped by every culture. Drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept, E pluribus unum: Out of many, one. Now much has been made of the fact that an African-American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected president. (APPLAUSE) But my personal story is not so unique. The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores. And that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average. Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That is why there is a mosque in every state in our union and over 1,200 mosques within our borders. That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it. So let there be no doubt... (APPLAUSE) ... let there be no doubt, Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations: to live in peace and security, to get an education and to work with dignity, to love our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope of all humanity. Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead. And if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all. For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. (APPLAUSE) That is what it means to share this world in the 21st Century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace, for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes, and, yes, religions subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it. Our problems must be dealt with through partnership, our progress must be shared. (APPLAUSE) Now, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite. We must face these tensions squarely. And so, in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all its forms. In Ankara, I made clear that America is not and never will be at war with Islam. (APPLAUSE) We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject, the killing of innocent men, women and children. And it is my first duty as president to protect the American people. The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals and our need to work together. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al-Qaida and the Taliban with broad international support. We did not go by choice. We went because of necessity. I'm aware that there's still some who would question or even justify the offense of 9/11. But let us be clear. Al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men, women and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet al-Qaida chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated. These are facts to be dealt with. Make no mistake, we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We see no military -- we seek no military bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan, and now Pakistan, determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. But that is not yet the case. And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries. And despite the costs involved, America's commitment will not weaken. Indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists. They have killed in many countries. They have killed people of different faiths but, more than any other, they have killed Muslims. Their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam. The holy Quran teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as -- it is as it if has killed all mankind. (APPLAUSE) And the holy Quran also says whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. (APPLAUSE) The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism; it is an important part of promoting peace. Now, we also know that military power alone is not going solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That's why we plan to invest $1.5 billion each year over the next five years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced. That's why we are providing more than $2.8 billion to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on. Now, let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world. Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. (APPLAUSE) Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: 'I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will be.' Today America has a dual responsibility to help Iraq forge a better future and to leave Iraq to Iraqis. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people... (APPLAUSE) I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no basis and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically-elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. (APPLAUSE) We will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy. But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner and never as a patron. And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles. 9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable. But in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States. And I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. (APPLAUSE) So America will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law. And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities, which are also threatened. The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer. Now, the second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians and the Arab world. America's strong bonds with Israel are well-known. This bond is unbreakable. It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. Around the world the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries. And anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot and gassed to death by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed, more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless. It is ignorant, and it is hateful. Threatening Israel with destruction or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of the Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve. On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people, Muslims and Christians, have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years, they've endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the daily humiliations, large and small, that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt, the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own. (APPLAUSE) For decades, then, there has been a stalemate. Two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers. For Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history, from within its borders as well as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth. The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security. (APPLAUSE) That is in Israel's interests, Palestine's interests, America's interests and the world's interests. And that's why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all of the patience and dedication that the task requires. The obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the Road Map are clear. For peace to come, it is time for them and all of us to live up to our responsibilities. Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding. This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia, to Eastern Europe to Indonesia. It's a story with a simple truth: violence is a dead end. It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children or to blow up old women on a bus. That's not how moral authority is claimed, that's how it is surrendered. Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern with institutions that serve the needs of its people. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities, to play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist. At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. (APPLAUSE) This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop. (APPLAUSE) And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society. Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security, neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace. And Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. And, finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibility. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past. America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true. Too many tears have been shed, too much blood has been shed. All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians could, can see their children grow up without fear, when the holy land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be, when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra -- as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed -- peace be upon them -- joined in prayer. (APPLAUSE) The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons. This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. For many years, Iran has defined itself, in part, by its opposition to my country. And there is, in fact, a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. The question now is not what Iran is against but, rather, what future it wants to build. I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve. There will be many issues to discussion between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect. But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point. This is not simply about America's interests. It's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path. Now, I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. No single nations should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons. (APPLAUSE) And any nation, including Iran, should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That commitment is at the core of the treaty. And it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal. The fourth issue that I will address is democracy. (APPLAUSE) I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years. And much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear. No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other. That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed, confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice, government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people, the freedom to live as you choose. These are not just American ideas. They are human rights. And that is why we will support them everywhere. (APPLAUSE) Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise. But this much is clear. Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments, provided they govern with respect for all their people. This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. (APPLAUSE) So no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power. You must maintain your power through consent, not coercion. You must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise. You must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy. (AUDIENCE MEMBER SHOUTS) Thank you. (APPLAUSE) The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom. Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance. We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia where devout Christians worshipped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. That is the spirit we need today. People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul. This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive. But it's being challenged in many different ways. Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of somebody else's faith. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld, whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. (APPLAUSE) And if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq. Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together. We must always examine the ways in which people protect it. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. That's why I'm committed to work with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat. Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit, for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretense of liberalism. In fact, faith should bring us together. And that's why we're forging service projects in America to bring together Christians, Muslims and Jews. That's why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service so bridges between peoples lead to action, whether it is combating malaria in Africa or providing relief after a natural disaster. The sixth issue -- the sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights. (APPLAUSE) I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue. I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal. But I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. (APPLAUSE) And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well-educated are far more likely to be prosperous. Now let me be clear, issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of American life and in countries around the world. I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons. (APPLAUSE) Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity, men and women, to reach their full potential. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal. And I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. But it should be their choice. That is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams. (APPLAUSE) Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities but also huge disruptions and change in communities. In all nations, including America, this change can bring fear; fear that, because of modernity, we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly, our identities, those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions and our faith. But I also know that human progress cannot be denied. There need not be contradictions between development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures. The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. In ancient times and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education. And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century. And in too... (APPLAUSE) And in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas. I am emphasizing such investment within my own country. And while America, in the past, has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we new seek a broader engagement. On education, we will expand change programs and increase scholarships like the one that brought my father to America. (APPLAUSE) At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world and create a new, online network so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo. On economic development, we will create a new core of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world. On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim majority country and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can create more jobs. We will open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today, I'm announcing a new global effort with the organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health. All these things must be done in partnership. Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments, community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life. The issues that I have described will not be easy to address, but we have a responsibility to join together to behalf of the world that we seek, a world where extremists no longer threaten our people and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes, a world where governments serve their citizens and the rights of all God's children are respected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieve it together. I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this new beginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division and to stand in the way of progress. Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort, that we are fated to disagree and civilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur. There is so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years. But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward. And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country. You more than anyone have the ability to reimagine the world, the remake this world. All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart or whether we commit ourselves to an effort, a sustained effort to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children and to respect the dignity of all human beings. It's easier to start wars than to end them. It's easier to blame others than to look inward. It's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path. There is one rule that lies at the heart of every religion, that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. (APPLAUSE) This truth transcends nations and peoples, a belief that isn't new, that isn't black or white or brown, that isn't Christian or Muslim or Jew. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world. It's a faith in other people. And it's what brought me here today. We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written. The holy Quran tells us: 'Mankind, we have created you male and a female. And we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.' The Talmud tells us: 'The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.' The holy Bible tells us: 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.' (APPLAUSE) The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now that must be our work here on Earth. Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you. END "
1,"MOSCOW - Here's what the world looks like in a country where the government controls the media: One evening, the main television channel uses prime time to broadcast a concert across vast Russia, paying tribute to the much-feared tax collectors. Another day, media overseers charge a respected newspaper with extremism - for straightforward reporting on neo-Nazi groups. The late-November concert in honor of the 20th anniversary of the tax inspectorate is a merry affair. Famous entertainers joke and sing. A chorus of tax collectors joins in, glowing in stage lights, gold braid dripping from the shoulders of their military-style uniforms, a song of money on their lips - hardly the intimidating agents capable of bringing down a suddenly inconvenient billionaire or ruining a small-business owner without the right friends. The state does not offer such an admiring audience for crusading journalists such as Dmitri Muratov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta and recipient of the warning for promoting extremist views. One more such warning, and the paper can be shut down. The offending article was a follow-up to a January 2009 double slaying. Anastasia Baburova, a 25-year-old intern for the paper who had been writing about youthful fascist movements, was shot in the back of head after she left a news conference and headed to a busy subway station with Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer and journalist. He took the first shot. Both died. Earlier this year, Novaya Gazeta examined the organization, membership and pronouncements of neo-Nazi groups, mostly quoting from their websites. Muratov thought the article - conventional by Western standards - would set off a government investigation of fascists. 'Instead, we got a warning against extremism,' he said. The paper recently lost its appeal of the warning, which had arrived in March. Muratov is preparing another appeal, to Russia's Constitutional Court, and even the European Court of Human Rights. 'If we don't write about neo-Nazis and corruption, then what will we write about?' he asked. 'A star who has had another facelift?' Muratov supervises 60 journalists impatient to shed light in dark corners, even though something of a standing death threat hangs over them. Six Novaya journalists have been killed or died under unexplained circumstances. The most well known, Anna Politkovskaya, a war correspondent and human rights defender, was shot to death in her apartment building in 2006. The air of intimidation creates a deficiency of free speech, said Alexander Lebedev, a billionaire former KGB agent who owns 49 percent of Novaya Gazeta along with Mikhail Gorbachev. 'Novaya Gazeta takes the place of public opinion,' Lebedev said. And the three- day-a-week paper excels, he said, because of Muratov. 'He's a great man, he's very honest, he's very brave, and he's a very talented editor.' Lebedev is a banker who wants to be seen as a publisher and investigative journalist - he owns both the Evening Standard and the Independent in London. Despite his past, he said, he never liked restrictions on his travel and speech. His National Reserve Bank in Moscow was raided early last month by about 100 commandos carrying semiautomatic weapons and wearing black ski masks. The raid came just after Novaya Gazeta had published a long, exclusive interview with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oil tycoon who ran afoul of the government and has been in jail on tax and fraud charges since 2003. 'It was about intimidation, and nothing else,' said Lebedev, who added the raid has frightened customers and cost him $100 million in deposits. 'It's definitely a message,' he said, 'but from whom? Could it be a message from corrupt officials working on their own, or someone else?' Muratov wonders the same. Kremlin property department officials recently won a libel judgment after the paper published allegations of corruption in Kremlin- financed construction projects. The suit appeared at odds with the president's frequent complaints about endemic corruption - President Dmitry Medvedev even mentioned millions stolen in state purchasing transactions during his state of the nation speech last week. Andrei Richter, director of the Media Law and Policy Institute, said the government dislikes Novaya Gazeta but needs it, as well as outspoken radio station Ekho Moskvy, as evidence of freedom of speech for visiting dignitaries. 'Closing it would be quite a scandal,' he said, 'but the government doesn't mind warning the newspaper. It's a cold shower.' Muratov speaks of his newspaper's battles with the patience acquired by Russians during centuries in the embrace of indifferent if not hostile authorities. He begins to lose that patience when he talks about television, where most Russians get their news and where state oversight is particularly vigilant. A TV journalist he admires, Leonid Parfyonov, disappeared from news programs as the state tightened its control, relegating Parfyonov to making historical documentaries. The night before its paean to the tax police, Channel One presented Parfyonov with the Vladislav Listyev award for excellence, named for a TV journalist slain in 1995. In his acceptance, Parfyonov did the unthinkable, calling television a public relations agency for the state. Russian leaders are like the dead, he said. If journalists cannot speak well of them, they can say nothing at all. His remarks were not broadcast but were published on the website. 'They talk about a market economy,' Muratov said, referring to Russian officials, his voice rising with emotion. 'Go to hell. We'll have a market economy when we have TV ratings and give people what they want to see.' Novaya Gazeta is tiny compared with the national television audience. It says it has 350,000 subscribers and 1.5 million readers. But it attracts a loyal and idealistic following. Nikita Girin, 20, an intern about to be employed full time, remembers seeing Novaya Gazeta for the first time at age 16 in his home town of Ryazan. 'When I opened it and started reading,' he said, 'I realized I knew nothing about my country. After that, I knew I wanted to change things, if only in people's heads.' Danger has hardly scared him off. 'I know I might be beaten, but I can't use that as an excuse - that would make me passive. If you are going to work honestly, you have to be ready to be beaten up.'

1,"A powerful security adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan has resigned from his post, saying he will seek the presidency himself in Nigeria's coming election. A spokesman says National Security Adviser Aliyu Gusau resigned his position on Friday. Spokesman Adekunle Adebisi says Gusau will apply Monday to the ruling People's Democratic Party to run as a candidate in the October primaries. Gusau, a retired Army general, is a powerful, behind-the-scenes player in Nigeria's military and security agencies. He served as national security adviser to Nigeria's two past presidents. He also ran in the 2007 presidential primary before bowing out. Jonathan became president after the death of Nigeria's elected leader in May and formally launched his campaign Saturday. "
1,"England's World Cup bid team predicts a $240 million profit will be made if it stages the event in 2018. The estimate is based on ticket revenue of $897 million for the World Cup and Confederations Cup in 2017 against the expected $657 million cost of staging the tournament. It does not include revenues from sponsorship and broadcasting rights, which are sold by FIFA. Also among 18 commitments released Wednesday, England pledges to give fans free transport on match days. England 2018 has also met its one outstanding commitment from the FIFA inspection visit in August by contracting a minimum of 60,000 hotel rooms. FIFA votes on the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in December. England is focused on 2018, but is still in both races. "
1,"In a decision with important ramifications for peace talks on the divided island of Cyprus, a British court ruled Tuesday that a British couple could not keep their holiday villa in northern Cyprus. The court of appeal decision upheld an earlier European Court of Justice ruling that will return the disputed property to Meletis Apostolides, whose Greek Cypriot family was forced to leave the northern part of the island in 1974 after the Turkish invasion. The ruling establishes that he is the rightful owner of the property, which belonged to his family before the invasion, and that David and Linda Orams have to demolish the villa they built on the land and abandon their claim to the property they purchased in 2002. 'I feel good but not because someone else is sad,' Apostolides told a press conference after his victory. 'I would like to have my property back because it is my human right.' He said the Orams knew they faced a possible legal challenge when they purchased the property. The British couple says they bought the property 'in good faith.' The decision is a setback for thousands of other people -- mostly Britons -- who have bought disputed property in northern Cyprus, which was abandoned by many Greek Cypriots during the bloody fighting. The island is split into a Greek Cypriot south and a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north. Marian Stokes, founder of the Homebuyers' Pressure Group, said property owners in northern Cyprus are 'disappointed and shocked' at the ruling. 'This has paved the way for the political situation to be one-sided -- it gives the Greek Cypriots an advantage,' said the 55-year-old native of Dublin, Ireland. Despite the ruling, Stokes said the estimated 22,000 foreign property owners in the north aren't ready to give up their homes. 'People here, they don't think they've done anything wrong,' she said. 'They don't want to leave.' She said the ruling's full impact is still unclear and foreign owners were waiting for advice from the Turkish Cypriot government, which is recognized only by Turkey. 'People hope this is an isolated case,' she said. Resolving disputes over property is proving to be a difficult hurdle in the goal of reaching an overall peace deal for the island. The two sides remain far apart on questions involving compensation, land swaps and other financial matters. Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias said the ruling is a rejection of the Turkish Cypriot position on the property dispute. 'The ruling has great legal and political significance,' he said. 'Legal in that the British court ruled on the basis of the laws and regulations of the European Union and the Council of Europe's human rights convention, and political in that it answers the other side, which wants to deny the right to property.' David Orams, who lives in Hove, 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of London, said he and his wife 'unwittingly became entangled' in the complex dispute when they spent much of their life savings building the villa in northern Cyprus. The legal process has taken more than five years. 'The ruling is very disappointing and a blow to us,' he said. 'But we will not let it ruin our lives. We will study the judgment and consider whether there is anything further to be done. Failing that, we will have to take steps as far as possible, given the political situation, to comply with the judgment.' ------ Associated Press Writers Menelaos Hadjicostis in Cyprus and Priyal Sanghavi in London contributed to this report "
1,"Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta has agreed a new five-year deal, which the Premier League club said Saturday should end speculation that the Spaniard could leave. Throughout the offseason, the 28-year-old Arteta has been linked with moves to bigger clubs but has now said he wants to stay to help Everton improve on last season's eighth-place finish. 'What this summer has made me realize is how important I am to the club and how important the club is to me,' Arteta said Saturday. 'The chairman and the manager wanted me to stay 120 percent and that makes me feel proud. 'We are all seeing the club and the future in the same way and that is special -- something that you don't always find. I believe in this squad ... something is happening here and I want to be a part of it.' Arteta, who has never played for the senior Spanish national team, joined Everton in a permanent deal five years ago after an initial six-month loan from Real Sociedad. Chairman Bill Kenwright described Arteta as 'one of the finest players ever to wear an Everton shirt.' Arteta is the fifth Everton player to agree a new contract since the end of last season, with Tim Cahill, Seamus Coleman, Jack Rodwell and Leighton Baines also committing themselves to the Liverpool cub.

1,"The official at the Securities and Exchange Commission who later would marry Bernard Madoff's niece told investigators this year that if he had carefully reviewed a complaint about the disgraced financier's business, he would have investigated more deeply, a new report shows. The admission by Eric Swanson, who was an SEC attorney and inspections official during a 2003-04 exam of Madoff's operations, is among a trove of revelations in the report by SEC inspector general David Kotz. Swanson told a colleague in April 2004 that the inspection of Madoff's business was ongoing, after the exam team had stopped working on it, according to the report. It said Swanson recently explained that an inspection would be considered ongoing even if it were put on hold. Kotz's investigation found no evidence that the relationship between Swanson and Madoff's niece, Shana, who married in 2007, influenced the SEC exams of Madoff. Swanson testified in the inquiry that he wasn't closely involved in the 2003-04 Madoff exam after Mark Donohue became an assistant director of the SEC inspections division in February 2004 and that he never discussed the exam with Shana Madoff. But the Madoff inspection 'was put on the back burner' even though the exam team still had unresolved questions, the report says. The 477-page document, released Friday evening, paints in excruciating detail how the SEC probes of Madoff were bungled over 16 years -- with disputes among agency inspection staffers over the findings, lack of communication among SEC offices in various cities, and repeated failures to act on credible, specific complaints that formed a sea of red flags. Madoff 'attempted to intimidate and impress examiners,' and he dropped names to them of top officials in the agency, the report says. One of the examiners quoted describes him as 'charismatic' and 'charming' -- 'except when he was angry with us.' Among the disclosures: At one point during an agency investigation in May 2006, Madoff feared that he had been caught. 'I thought it was the end game, over,' Madoff was quoted as saying when SEC investigators queried him about what account he was using to clear certain trades. He said he felt very fortunate when there was no follow-up call to check on the account number he had given the investigators. 'After all this, I got away lucky,' he told Kotz in a prison interview, though added he thought it was just a matter of time before he would eventually be caught. That 'narrow escape' in 2006, enabled by the SEC enforcement staff neglecting to verify Madoff's account at a securities industry clearinghouse for trades, allowed his fraudulent scheme to flourish for another 2 1/2 years, the report says. Madoff, who pleaded guilty in March, is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in North Carolina for a Ponzi scheme that could be the biggest in U.S. history. It destroyed thousands of people's life savings, wrecked charities and gave investors' already shaken confidence in the financial system yet another big jolt. Revelations in December of the SEC's failure to uncover Madoff's massive scheme touched off one of the most painful scandals in the agency's 75-year history. 'It is a failure that we continue to regret, and one that has led us to reform in many ways how we regulate markets and protect investors,' SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said in a statement Friday. 'In the coming weeks we will continue to closely review the full report and learn every lesson we can to help build upon the many reforms we have already put into place since January.' Schapiro, appointed by President Barack Obama, took over in January. Enforcement efforts have been strengthened, and the agency has started a number of initiatives meant to protect investors in the wake of the financial crisis, officials say. Swanson acknowledged in his testimony to the IG's office this year that if he had carefully examined complaints about Madoff's business, he would have dug more thoroughly, according to the report. Swanson said a complaint from outside the SEC and financial articles on Madoff published in 2001 'mean something different to (Swanson) today than they did at the time of the (SEC) examination' in 2003-04, the report says. It quotes Swanson as saying, 'I didn't know anything, very little anyway, about hedge funds and mutual funds and how they operated.' Swanson now is general counsel of BATS, a major securities trading exchange. His spokesman, Eric Starkman, said Friday that 'the report speaks for itself.' The SEC enforcement staff 'almost immediately caught Madoff in lies and misrepresentations but failed to follow up on inconsistencies' and rejected whistleblowers' offers to provide additional evidence, the report says. Kotz's investigation, begun the week before Christmas last year, involved interviews with 122 people and reviews of thousands of documents. Among those interviewed were former SEC chairmen Christopher Cox and William Donaldson, as well as Lori Richards, the former director of the SEC inspections office, who was Swanson's boss, and Linda Thomsen, the former enforcement director. Kotz's probe found no evidence of improper ties between agency officials and Madoff, nor of senior SEC officials trying to influence the agency's investigations of his business. ---- AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report.

1,"Two Los Angeles Clippers basketball broadcasters were suspended one game by the Fox Sports Prime Ticket cable network for their comments about an Iranian-born NBA player. Longtime play-by-play announcer Ralph Lawler and color analyst Michael Smith made their off-the-cuff comments about the Memphis Grizzlies center Hamed Haddadi during Wednesday night's telecast from Memphis. The on-air banter, which includes remarks to Borat actor Sacha Baron Cohen, offended a viewer who e-mailed Fox to complain. The duo did not work Friday's night telecast against the Denver Nuggets at Staples Center. Michael Eaves and Don MacLean, who regularly serve as halftime and postgame analysts on the Clippers telecasts, substituted for Lawler and Smith at courtside. Lawler, 71, is in his 31st season doing Clippers games, and Smith is in his 12th. Lawler has surpassed 2,400 regular season and playoff Clippers broadcasts in his career, according to the team's Web site. 'We regret the remarks made by Clippers announcers Michael Smith and Ralph Lawler during Wednesday's telecast,' Fox said in a statement about 2 1/2 hours before the game. 'While we believe that Michael and Ralph did not intend their exchange to be offensive, the comments were inappropriate. 'We extend our apologies to Hamed Haddadi of the Memphis Grizzlies and to anyone who was offended. We have addressed the situation with Michael and Ralph and have taken appropriate action.' The Clippers did not comment. The transcript of the conversation between Lawler and Smith, which occurred late in the game, was printed on the Los Angeles Times' Web site: Smith: 'Look who's in.' Lawler: 'Hamed Haddadi. Where's he from?' Smith: 'He's the first Iranian to play in the NBA.' (Smith pronounced Iranian as 'Eye-ranian,' a pronunciation that offended the viewer who complained.) Lawler: 'There aren't any Iranian players in the NBA,' repeating Smith's mispronunciation. Smith: 'He's the only one.' Lawler: 'He's from Iran?' Smith: 'I guess so.' Lawler: 'That Iran?' Smith: 'Yes.' Lawler: 'The real Iran?' Smith: 'Yes.' Lawler: 'Wow. Haddadi that's H-A-D-D-A-D-I.' Smith: 'You're sure it's not Borat's older brother?' Smith: 'If they ever make a movie about Haddadi, I'm going to get Sacha Baron Cohen to play the part.' Lawler: 'Here's Haddadi. Nice little back-door pass. I guess those Iranians can pass the ball.' Smith: 'Especially the post players. Lawler: 'I don't know about their guards.' "
1,"Stocks rose early Monday as traders were hopeful a report on manufacturing activity in the U.S. would mirror similar data from China that showed expansion there last month. The market was also getting a lift ahead of midterm elections and the Federal Reserve's meeting this week where the central bank is expected to announce a new economic stimulus program. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 50 points in early morning trading. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index slipped to 54 in October from 54.4 a month earlier. Even with the slight slowdown, any reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding. Manufacturing has shown the most consistent growth during the year as a recovery remains sluggish. A strong report on manufacturing out of China sent shares in that country sharply higher Monday. Growth accelerated in China as spending on infrastructure led to an increase in orders for new equipment. The Dow rose 47.22, or 0.4 percent, to 11,165.71 in early morning trading. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6.02, or 0.5 percent, to 1,189.28, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 11.14, or 0.4 percent, to 2,518.55. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.5 percent. Any movement tied to Monday's manufacturing report could be fleeting though as traders quickly turn their attention to Tuesday's midterm elections and the Fed's meeting, which wraps up Wednesday. Traders have been betting that Republicans will take control of at least the House of Representatives. That could slow President Barack Obama's agenda, which many analysts have said is not favorable to businesses. Investors have also been assuming the Fed will launch a new Treasury-buying program to help stimulate the economy. Stocks rose for much of October because investors expect the Fed will announce as early as Wednesday that it plans to buy government debt to drive interest rates lower in an effort to spark spending and lending. Only in the last few days has the market rally trailed off amid questions about exactly how much the Fed will spend to buy bonds. The Dow rose 3.1 percent in October, including a 0.1 percent drop last week. Lower interest rates weaken returns on debt, which would make stocks and commodities more attractive investments since their potential return would be significantly higher. Bond prices were mixed Monday, with short-term debt falling slightly and longer term Treasurys rising. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.58 percent from 2.60 percent late Friday. "
1,"A South African girl who survived a criminal attack that shocked the nation was among those killed when a train hit a school van this week, a family spokesman said Friday. Liesel Augis was only six years old when she was raped, beaten unconscious with a brick and thrown into a fire by a family friend in 2006. She survived and became known as 'Little Rock' because of her strength and resilience. On Wednesday, Liesel's bus driver went around a closed railroad crossing gate and the van was hit by a train. Nine children died at the scene in Cape Town, and a 10th died Friday. Only the driver and four children survived. Family spokesman Malvern de Bruyn said that Liesel had a zest for life, and the accident has left a deep scar in the family and the nation. 'We could see she was someone who wanted to defy anything that would cut her life,' de Bruyn said. Liesel's 2006 attacker, Abraham James, was sentenced to 28 years in jail without parole. Her attack was one of many that took place between 2000 and 2006 by several assailants at a stretch of open land in a suburb of Cape Town now known as 'Bushes of Devil.' The family's plight did not end with her attack. Days after James' arrest, unknown people tried to set fire to Liesel's home. De Bruyn said he had to find a refuge for them in the same area. After the attack Liesel started school at the Good Hope Primary School in Kuilsrivier, a suburb of Cape Town. She had to conceal her name and the incident from her schoolmates, de Bruyn said. 'We could not divulge her real name, only the school principal knew the name,' de Bruyn said. But 'the private school opened their arms to our child and gave all the support she needed.' Even Liesel would not talk about the incident, and would only refer to herself as 'Little Rock,' the name de Bruyn gave her, he said. The pseudonym suppressed her pain and her anger, but allowed her to build friendships without being taunted at school, he said. De Bruyn derived the name from the 1956 march in which some 20,000 women protested against the introduction of pass books that the apartheid government required them to carry at all times which restricted them to certain areas. The women then chanted, 'you struck a rock, you struck a woman.' 'I named her 'Little Rock' because she was as tough as a rock like those women who fight against apartheid,' he said. Liesel's problems were compounded by a family that was destitute and lived in a shack, he said. She was only able to go to school after a trust fund called The Little Rock Foundation was started for her and other child victims of rape. Local academics, non-governmental organizations and the community of Greater Blue Downs in western South Africa contributed to the foundation. The family that had to deal with the attacks, now has to deal with their little girl's death. Police said they are investigating a case of homicide against the van driver. Liesel will be buried on Sept. 4 along with nine other victims from Wednesday's crash. "
1,Portugal's borrowing costs have jumped to the highest level since the adoption of the euro amid uncertainty about whether the government can cut the country's debt levels. The interest rates on Portuguese 10-year bonds leaped to 6.5 percent Monday from 6.05 percent at the start of the day. The rise came two days before a planned bond issue which aims to raise up to (EURO)1 billion. The center-left Socialist government is currently preparing next year's state budget which it says will slash the budget deficit to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product. The government says its austerity plan will reduce the budget deficit to 7.3 percent this year from 9.3 percent in 2009. 
1,"Panasonic says its 3-D TVs sold out in the United States in their first week, raising optimism the technology that helped 'Avatar' break records at the box office will extend to living rooms and help boost profits. The shortage is prompting the world's largest plasma TV maker to take back- orders from retailers, Hitoshi Otsuki, the senior managing director heading Osaka-based Panasonic's overseas operations, said in Tokyo. He declined to specify figures. 'It's a great opportunity to turn around our TV business,' he said. TV makers are betting movies such as James Cameron's 'Avatar,' the highest- grossing film of all time, and sports events such as the 2010 FIFA World Cup will help drive demand for 3-D sets using improved technology. Still, a lack of programs and the need to use special eyewear, a reason that thwarted previous attempts to push adoption, may deter consumers. 'There are always people who want to buy high-end products,' said Kazuharu Miura, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets in Tokyo, said Wednesday. 'That's probably what's driving sales.' Panasonic became the first major TV maker to sell 3-D sets in the U.S. when its 50-inch full high-definition plasma TV went on sale at outlets of Best Buy with a pair of glasses and a 3-D Blu-ray player for $2,899.99 on March 10. Samsung Electronics, the world's largest TV maker, began offering a 55-inch 3-D model there for $3,299.99 on March 14, while Sony plans to start selling 3-D Bravia TVs from June. Samsung hasn't yet tracked its 3-D TV shipment figures, said Hwang Eun Ju, a spokeswoman for the South Korea-based electronics maker. Panasonic's TV operations had a loss of more than $111 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31. The business may turn profitable in the year ending March 2011, President Fumio Ohtsubo said March 3. TV makers are counting on 3-D broadcasts of major sporting events to stoke demand. FIFA said in December it agreed with Sony to deliver 3-D images from as many as 25 matches of this year's soccer World Cup in South Africa. ESPN 3-D will start in June and broadcast 85 live events the first year, the Bristol, Conn.-based sports network said in January. Discovery Communications Inc., Sony and Imax Corp. announced a venture at the time to introduce a 3-D channel in 2011. Global shipments of 3-D TVs may reach 4.2 million this year and more than triple to 12.9 million in 2011, according to El Segundo, California-based researcher ISuppli Corp. this month. Revenue from the sets may more than double to $20 billion next year, according to ISuppli. Samsung has said it aims to sell more than 2 million 3-D TVs this year, while Panasonic expects to sell as many as one million globally in the year starting April 1. LG Electronics has said it's targeting sales of 400,000 3-D TV sets in 2010. 'Finally we have real televisions,' Bob Perry, a U.S.- based senior vice president at Panasonic's audio-visual products marketing unit, said in a March 10 Bloomberg Television interview. '3-D makes TV real.' Sony, which said last week it plans to sell at least 25 million TVs in the year starting April, predicts sales of 3-D sets will probably account for about 10 percent of the total. 'It will probably take a long time for 3-D TVs to expand broadly, maybe about three years' said Ichiro Michikoshi, an analyst at electronics research firm BCN Inc. in Tokyo. 'There isn't enough content and consumers dislike wearing the glasses. Those issues will take time to be solved.' Cho reported from Seoul. Takako Iwatani and Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo contributed. "
1,"This is a two-person, two-party town now. And President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and incoming House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, need each other -- as both partners and foils while they push their own legislative agendas and lay the groundwork for the 2012 elections. The unlikely duo must find areas of compromise to get something -- anything, really -- done to appease an unhappy electorate demanding economic stability from a government voters don't think works. At the same time, each leader must figure out how to use the other to draw partisan contrasts that will fire up their respective political bases. Both risk the wrath of voters in two years if they fail on either task; nothing short of Obama's re-election, the Republicans' newfound grip on power and the country's economic well-being is at stake. For now, Obama is the one on the defensive -- and it showed in the hours after the election, with Democrats uniformly calling for common ground while the Republicans put conditions on its willingness to meet halfway. Come January if not sooner, Boehner will command greater capital in Washington and sway over the domestic agenda. But Obama must find a way to reboot his presidency by altering his goals, communicating them better -- or both. The first glimpses of how both men position themselves came Wednesday, with each leader addressing the public in the wake of Republicans winning control of the House and cutting deeply into Democrats' Senate majority. 'No one party will be able to dictate where we go from here,' a weakened president said from the White House. 'We must find common ground in order to make progress.' 'I'm not suggesting this will be easy,' Obama added. Boehner signaled as much earlier in the day by claiming Obama's health care overhaul was a 'monstrosity' and needed to be repealed. He also suggested that the Republicans' cooperation was conditional, saying: 'We hope President Obama will now respect the will of the people, change course and commit to making the changes they are demanding. To the extent he is willing to do this, we are ready to work with him.' One by one, Democrats -- their ranks diminished -- weighed in and called for a new approach to working together. Fresh off his own re-election victory, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he was planning to speak with his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, about ways to 'build a consensus and move this country along.' The Democrat said the Republican Party must be more open to compromise, adding that 'the time for politics is now over' and Republicans must do more than 'simply saying 'no.'' Still, in a sign of fights ahead, Reid said the health care measure was 'ready for some tweaking' but that he won't support any move to repeal it. There was talk of forthcoming high profile gathering with Obama and new Republican leadership. But the day-after rhetoric was typical for the aftermath of a wave election -- and it was likely to disappear as the hard reality takes shape of two parties with opposing viewpoints trying to govern a country in crisis. In the long-term, the onus is on Republicans and Democrats alike to prove to Americans who are sour on both political parties that Washington isn't broken. Both Obama and Boehner need to show results to keep their jobs in 2012 and, in a split government, the only way to get results is to compromise. Nothing will get done in Washington without the two meeting somewhere in the middle. And from there, divides also will have to be bridged in the Senate, which will have nearly as many Republicans as Democrats. Could this two-party governance force politicians with diametrically opposite viewpoints to find common ground? Maybe. There's no doubt Obama's predicament will invoke comparisons to presidents who also faced a Congress run by the opposition party. But for all the similarities, there are stark differences, too. In the 1990s, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich partnered to enact welfare reform. But the Republican House speaker then was a personally polarizing figure -- one who alienated the electorate -- in a way that Boehner is not, at least not now. Unlike Obama and Boehner, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill easily developed an amicable relationship that took the edge off their partisan differences in the 1980s. But even Reagan had to moderate his conservative ideas after Republican losses in the House. Both Clinton and Reagan maneuvered in divided government as the country was trying to recover from recession. But Obama's economy is rebounding at a much slower pace, with just 2 percent growth. One area of potential compromise for Obama and Boehner concerns free trade treaties with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But many Republicans want to join Democrats and punish China, raising the risk of a U.S.-China trade war. Both parties also are awaiting a December report from a bipartisan deficit commission, giving both sides cover as they try to both meet voters' demands and protect their own politics. -------- EDITOR'S NOTE -- Liz Sidoti has covered national politics for The Associated Press since 2003.

1,"The Obama administration indicated to reporters this week that long-awaited action codifying the Bush-era policy of indefinite detention for suspected terrorists would be put in place through executive order. This is both very bad and an improvement over the status quo. Rather than abandoning indefinite detention, President Obama is seeking simply to make the process fairer. The coming proposal improves on the Bush administration detention review process in that it would reportedly be more adversarial - detainees would be represented by a lawyer, and the boards would be made up of more than just military officials. The process would be, as The New York Times describes it, basically a kind of 'parole board' for suspected terrorists. The use of indefinite military detention in armed conflict is well-established, but it's not clear whether those who would be detained under this policy are 'battlefield captures' or whether military detention is a smoke screen for holding indefinitely people who should be charged with a crime or released. Complicating this is the reality that the fight with al-Qaida has no defined endpoint. The administration could argue that by using an executive order, it's avoiding more constraints on detainee rights than would probably be the result of going through a Republican Congress. An executive order means that indefinite detention isn't a 'permanent' fixture of U.S. law. As University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney told ProPublica, an executive order 'doesn't have staying power if the next administration doesn't want it.' The danger is that the fight against al-Qaida may be endless, and it's hard to remember a president willingly ceding executive power. One question is whether the proposal would apply merely to the Bush administration 'legacy cases' at Guantanamo, which include individuals difficult to try in either military or civilian forums because of abuse they endured during the Bush administration, or future cases as well. While indefinite detention would officially become part of the Obama administration's national security policy, the proposal also provides a ray of hope for those detainees who have lost their habeas cases and are being held indefinitely with little chance of release. The proposal is basically what we've come to expect from the Obama administration on security and civil liberties. Having promised to reverse the trajectory of Bush-era national security policies, Obama has settled on making them marginally more lawful and humane. It's not nothing, but it's not what Obama promised - or what much of the left hoped for.

1,"Robert Culp, a dashing actor who earned his most enduring fame for his starring role opposite Bill Cosby in the hit 1960s espionage TV series 'I Spy' and as part of the swinging quartet of suburban lovers in the 1969 film comedy 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,' died March 24 at a hospital in Los Angeles after a fall near his home. He was 79. Although he appeared on Broadway and sporadically in movies, Culp was mostly a familiar presence to several generations of television viewers. Tall, and lithe, with smoothly combed black hair, he was adept at conveying charm and wit. As the years passed, he developed an appealing grumpiness on such TV series as 'The Greatest American Hero,' as an FBI agent, in the early 1980s and 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' as Ray Romano's father-in-law. Beginning in the 1950s, Culp appeared in several Broadway productions and in early TV anthology series. Summoned to Hollywood, he proved his versatility in a supporting role in 'PT 109' (1963) as Ensign George 'Barney' Ross, in the romantic comedy 'Sunday in New York' (1963) with Jane Fonda and in 'The Raiders' (1964) as Old West gunfighter 'Wild Bill' Hickok. In later years, his aged good looks and debonair style led to many roles as elected officials, including in 'Turk 182!' (1985) as the mayor of New York and 'The Pelican Brief' (1993) as the commander in chief. Television historian Robert Thompson said Culp's greatest legacy was his co- starring role in 'I Spy,' which Thompson called one the 'hippest TV shows to have ever aired.' The espionage adventure, which was on NBC from 1965 to 1968, was groundbreaking in casting the little-known nightclub comedian Cosby. The series was one of the first to present a black male actor in a dramatic leading role. The show, which combined dry humor and intrigue, attracted a devoted following, and Culp earned several Emmy Award nominations playing Kelly Robinson, an American spy masquerading as a world-class tennis player. Cosby, also an agent, portrayed Robinson's trainer and traveling companion Alexander Scott. In plotlines, they out-schemed foreign governments and engaged in shoot-outs with evil henchmen atop skyscrapers in exotic locales. Much of the filming was done on location. When the show was recalled in later years, Cosby's historical role in the series often overshadowed the easy chemistry between Cosby and Culp, who was regarded as the finer actor. 'Bob could make mincemeat out of me in front of the camera,' Cosby told the New York Times in 1965, 'but he's been very unselfish, a tremendous help.' Robert Martin Culp was born Aug. 16, 1930, either in Oakland or Berkeley, Calif, according to biographical sources. He attended several colleges before entering drama school at the University of Washington. He reportedly dropped out shortly before earning a degree to move to New York, and he soon began to win small parts on Broadway. He said his role in an off- Broadway production of 'He Who Gets Slapped' earned him an acting award that led to bigger TV roles, including a starring role in CBS's western series 'Trackdown,' and then to film. After the success of 'I Spy,' Culp was in great demand as an actor. His best leading role came in director Paul Mazursky's 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,' a highly popular film at the time that satirized the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Culp and Natalie Wood played California spouses Bob and Carol, whose therapy sessions at a trendy retreat lead them to embrace a wife-swapping lifestyle with their friends Ted and Alice (played by Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon). In the 1970s, Culp, who had written several 'I Spy' scripts, tried his hand at film writing and produced a documentary on the economics of black America called 'Operation Breadbasket,' which he sold to ABC-TV. Culp, who had grown active in civil rights causes, later admitted that his talents were better used other than writing. 'After I made it,' Culp told The Washington Post in 1985, 'Jesse Jackson told me I'd do the most good for the movement and for myself if I returned to my profession, so I did.' In 1972, Culp co-wrote and directed the movie thriller 'Hickey & Boggs,' starring Cosby and himself as downtrodden private eyes in Los Angeles. It made no impact at the box office. Culp was married and divorced several times, including once to actress France Nuyen. Information on survivors could not be confirmed. "
1,"Normally, a three-day weekend that feels never-ending is cause for celebration. But in the case of the urban comedy 'Lottery Ticket,' a few days can be a long time for the main character _ and for the audience. A long Fourth of July weekend is all that stands between recent high school graduate Kevin (played by rapper Bow Wow) and a $370 million jackpot. Owner of the winning ticket, Kevin can claim his prize once the next workday begins, but until then he has to contend with the other inhabitants of his housing project, including a gold digger, a muscly ex-con and a wealth of questionably intentioned friends. 'Do you know what could happen in three whole days?' Kevin wonders. The answer is a jumble of comedy and drama with a sprinkling of 'After School Special' messaging and some head-scratchingly bad choices. Most people in such a quandary would, perhaps, hide in a closet at a friend's house. But writers Erik White (who also directs) and Abdul Williams have the young man make decisions far beyond the potential for suspended disbelief. Disclosing his new wealth to the whole neighborhood? Check. Taking money from a loan shark with a brigade of Bentleys in a dark warehouse? Check. Getting busy with an unabashed gold digger who wants to be his 'baby mama'? ('This is my lottery ticket,' she claims, gesturing to her partially disrobed brick house of a body.) Gross and, yes, check. Despite the many uneven moments, there are some bright spots. Bow Wow has surprisingly good comic timing, especially when said man-eater begins aggressively seducing him under a mirrored ceiling. A scene with a fancy-footed and opportunistic preacher (Mike Epps) proves especially memorable, as the man fondles his long silky hair while narrating a slide show of the things God wants him to have, including a nicer church, a mansion that screams Miami and a young, hot wife. Most unexpected of all is Faheem Najm's (a.k.a. rapper T-Pain) brief and infectiously amusing portrayal of a liquor store clerk. It would seem the Grammy winner has talents beyond singing 'I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper).' But things really slow down during the movie's ill-advised forays into drama. When a curious old man living in a cellar (played by Ice Cube) discusses his past as a sparring partner for some of boxing's greatest legends, resplendent music begins to soar before he declares, 'I just wish someone would come along and make a difference.' He might as well have screamed, 'This is foreshadowing.' When Kevin gets into a fight with his best friend, the pair hams it up to the point of Oscar clip territory, and Kevin's behavior starts to look an awful lot like Frodo's, buckling under the weight of the ring. In the end, this three-day weekend takes up little more than an hour and a half, but it might be a holiday worth skipping. PG-13. Contains sexual content, language including a drug reference, violence and brief underage drinking. 95 minutes. "
1,"Britain's prosecution service says a veteran broadcaster who claimed in a TV documentary to have carried out the mercy killing of his dying lover has been charged with wasting police time. Prosecutor Helen Allen said Friday that 70-year-old Ray Gosling would appear at court to face the charge on Sept. 14. In a BBC program broadcast in February, Gosling said he had suffocated his partner, who was dying of AIDS. He did not give the name of the man, or say where or when the incident took place. Allen said police had conducted an extensive investigation and concluded there was no evidence to support Gosling's claim. Instead, they charged him with wasteful employment of the police, which carries a maximum punishment of six months' jail. "
1,"Bowing to pressure from Washington, Israel granted U.S.-trained Palestinian security forces greater autonomy in four major West Bank cities, Israeli and Palestinian defense officials said Thursday. The ability of Palestinian security forces to maintain law and order is key to Mideast peacemaking because Israel needs to be convinced that a future Palestinian state won't threaten its security. Israel already has turned over security control to Palestinians in three other West Bank cities. Israeli officials said the army would now reduce its presence in four more population centers -- Qalqiliya, Bethlehem, Jericho and Ramallah. The move stops short of a full withdrawal from these towns. However, Israeli will ease its requirement that Palestinian security forces in these towns coordinate their movements closely with the Israeli military. This would allow the Palestinians to decide for themselves things like where to deploy, and where they should be armed and uniformed, an Israeli official said. The Israeli military doesn't routinely patrol West Bank cities, but frequently conducts nighttime and occasional daytime arrest raids. Israeli troops will continue to enter the four cities when they deem fit, and will continue to maintain control of roads outside the towns, Israeli officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement and did not elaborate. Israel pulled out of major West Bank cities in the 1990s but re-entered them after the Palestinian uprising against Israel reignited in late 2000. Palestinians have long sought an Israeli pullback from those towns as a reassertion of sovereignty. The U.S. has been training thousands of forces in the West Bank in preparation for future Palestinian statehood. Israel says the Palestinian force has improved and has relinquished routine security duties in major West Bank towns, including Jenin, a one-time militant stronghold that has become a showcase for the force. 'We are doing our job protecting our people and there is no need for Israeli forces to enter our territories under the pretext of security needs,' said Adnan Dmeiri, a spokesman for the Palestinian security forces. Another apparent result of U.S. pressure has been the recent removal of some of the hundreds of Israeli roadblocks, including major obstacles near the city of Nablus and town of Jericho. Israel insists it needs the checkpoints to stop attackers but has also said it is committed to making life easier for Palestinians. Israel, however, has been wary of a complete handover to Palestinian security. During the Palestinian uprising, some Palestinian forces turned their guns against Israeli targets. And police loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, were unable to hold back the onslaught of Islamic Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip in 2007. Abbas now only controls the West Bank, while Gaza remains under Hamas control. Also Thursday, an Israeli soldier captured by Palestinian militants marked his third anniversary in captivity in Gaza, with no news on his plight. Sgt. Gilad Schalit, 22, was captured on June 25, 2006, by Hamas-affiliated militants who tunneled under the Gaza-Israel border and attacked a military post. Two other soldiers were killed in the raid. Schalit has not been seen since and the Red Cross has not been allowed to visit him, though Hamas has released two recorded statements from him and exchanged letters between him and his family. Former President Jimmy Carter delivered a letter from Schalit's parents to Hamas officials last week. Egyptian-mediated attempts to arrange a prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas have been unsuccessful. A Hamas spokesman, Osama Almuzeini, said Thursday that there were no new developments in the negotiations. He refused to confirm whether the soldier was alive or dead, saying Hamas would not give any 'information for free.' Hamas has demanded the release of hundreds of prisoners, including people convicted in deadly attacks on Israelis, in exchange for the soldier. "
1,"A passenger train in northern India crashed into another train's rear carriage reserved for women and disabled passengers, killing 22 people and injuring 16 who remained trapped for hours Wednesday near Agra, the home of the Taj Mahal, police said. Rescuers had to cut open the wrecked compartment to free trapped passengers following the crash outside Agra, about 130 miles (210 kilometers) southeast of New Delhi, said Rajesh Bajpai, a railway spokesman. Rescuers recovered 19 bodies during an operation that lasted nearly seven hours, said Rajesh Dixit, a police spokesman. Three of the 19 injured people died at a hospital, police said. No foreigners were among the victims, Dixit said. The smashed coach was reserved for women and physically handicapped people, although some other people may have been among the victims, district Magistrate Suresh Chandra Sharma said. The two trains were heading to New Delhi from southern India. The Mewar Express was stopped at a red signal when the other train rammed it from behind, Sharma, the district magistrate, told The Associated Press. 'We felt a massive jolt,' said Ramesh Charan, a passenger aboard the Mewar Express. 'Some people sleeping on upper berths fell to the coach floor by the impact of the collision.' Villagers and army soldiers stationed nearby helped police and rail officials in rescuing injured people. Authorities are still trying to determine why the accident happened, rail official Sri Prakash said. Accidents are common on India's sprawling rail network, which is one of the world's largest, with most blamed on poor maintenance. ------ Associated Press Writer Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow contributed to the report.

1,"The good news for Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina here in California was that they won their Republican primaries. The bad news was that they had to run in Republican primaries. Whitman, now the GOP nominee for governor, and Fiorina, the GOP nominee for senator, dispatched their nearest primary rivals by margins of better than 2 to 1. Each spent a queen's ransom to do so _ in Whitman's case, close to $80 million of her own money _ but both former CEOs have plenty left over to take on their Democratic opponents this fall: in Whitman's case, Jerry Brown, the once and, he hopes, future governor; in Fiorina's case, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer. But California Republican primaries have a nasty habit of rendering their winners unelectable in November, and this year's contest looks like it will be no exception. To win, Whitman and Fiorina _ conventional conservative business Republicans both _ had to take positions so far to the right that their chances of winning a state in which Barack Obama commands a 59 percent approval rating are slim. During one debate with her Republican opponents, Fiorina affirmed the right of suspected terrorists on no-fly lists to buy guns, presumably lest the gods of the National Rifle Association strike her dead on the spot. At a campaign event at Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday, Boxer, never one to let a hanging curveball go unswatted, contrasted Fiorina's guns-to- terrorists stance with her own co-authorship of a law allowing pilots to carry guns in cockpits. But the issue most damaging for Whitman and Fiorina is immigration. Pressed by their GOP primary opponents and the Republican electorate to endorse Arizona's draconian new law, Fiorina proclaimed her support for it while Whitman countered the charges from her right that she was soft on immigration by affirming that she was '100 percent against amnesty' and demanding a huge increase in border enforcement. To bolster her credibility, her ads featured former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson _ champion of 1994's Proposition 187, which would have denied all public services, including the right to attend primary and secondary schools, to illegal immigrants. Wilson won reelection in 1994 by backing 187, which the courts subsequently struck down. But his victory was probably the most pyrrhic in modern American politics. Threatened and enraged by 187, California's Latino immigrants began naturalizing, registering and voting in record numbers. Southern California's Latino-led labor movement _ the most energized and strategically savvy labor movement in the nation _ became particularly adept at turning out Latino voters for Democratic candidates and causes. In the process, the California electorate has been transformed _ moving the state decisively into the Democratic column. In the 1994 election, according to the nonprofit William C. Vel squez Institute, which seeks to raise minorities' political and economic participation, Latinos counted for 11.4 percent of California voters. By 2008, they comprised 21.4 percent. And particularly when immigration is an issue, theirs is a heavily Democratic vote. 'There's a whole generation of Latino voters who don't believe the Republicans look out for them,' Maria Elena Durazo, who heads the Los Angeles County AFL-CIO, told me on Election Day. 'We ran against Pete Wilson for years after he was out of office. And, voil ! He's back _ he's vouching for Whitman!' Labor will make sure the Latino community knows it. Already, the California Nurses Association is running an ad on Spanish-language radio that splices in a clip from a Whitman primary commercial in which she and Wilson discuss crac king down on immigration. When your own primary ad is directed against you by your opponents in the general election, you have a fundamental problem. It's not just that Republican nativism pushes perhaps a fifth of the electorate into the Democratic column. It's that the state's Republicans are simply far to the right of the majority of Californians _ so much so that they do not have a majority of registered voters in any one of the state's 53 congressional districts. There's a reason Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only Republican elected to a major statewide office in California since 1994 _ and it's not his celebrity status. It's because, when he was first elected governor, he did not have to run in and win a Republican primary: He was elected in a special recall election open to candidates and voters from all parties. Whitman and Fiorina had no such luck. In winning their nominations, they said things deeply offensive to a fatally large swath of California voters. Their campaigns may be gold-plated, but they have ears of purest tin. Meyerson is editor-at-large of American Prospect and the L.A. Weekly "
1,"Welcome word came late Wednesday afternoon that NBA Commissioner David Stern has suspended Gilbert Arenas from the Washington Wizards for an indefinite period, without pay. Stern originally thought it prudent to refrain from action pending the criminal investigation of a locker-room dispute involving Arenas, guns and a teammate. But in a statement on the NBA Web site, Sterns said that Arenas' 'ongoing conduct has led me to conclude that he is not currently fit to take the court in an NBA game.' No doubt Stern's about-face was prompted by Arenas' behavior _ captured in a photo featured on The Post's Sports front Wednesday _ in which he, thumbs up, index fingers out, pretends to shoot a bunch of his teammates who, in turn, just yukked it up. I found myself disgusted by these grown men _ supposed role models _ making sport of shooting another human being. And I couldn't help wondering how Abe Pollin, who died in November, would have reacted. So unsettled was Pollin by the carnage of gun violence that in the late 1990s he changed the name of this city's basketball team. He could not in good conscience promote a team called the Bullets, he said, when people _ many of them children _ were losing their lives. Pollin acted shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a longtime friend of his, died as the result of a gun wielded by an assassin. He stood in the spot where Rabin was shot, Pollin told The New York Times. 'Bullets connote killing, violence, death. Our slogan used to be, `Faster than a speeding bullet.' That's no longer appropriate.' Pollin knew that while tinkering with tradition might anger fans, principle was more important. I suspect Pollin would have thought: How dare Arenas flout the law and league regulations by bringing firearms into Verizon Center? How dare he use his young children to try to cover his dangerous behavior? How dare he be so reckless as to use guns to (supposedly) play a joke on a friend? And how dare his teammates just sit back and laugh? A grand jury is investigating Arenas' actions. I hope it shows him and his teammates that this is no laughing matter. Guns are not status symbols, and violence is never to be tolerated. In other words, Arenas and the Wizards _ indeed, all of us _ should live up to Abe Pollin's example.

1,"A friend mentioned at dinner not long ago that she didn't want to take vacations to places anymore; she wanted to take vacations in time. Rather than look at last-minute hotel choices on Expedia.com, why not take five days off to revisit the wondrous banality of 1983, 1962, 1950? Alas, the easiest way to get there is through the video screen. That might explain the popularity of 'Mad Men' and a few other TV shows that will do whatever it takes to accurately re-create a moment or era or vibe, to essentially get back to where they once belonged. Success in a period piece is such a tricky thing; the details required of verisimilitude are often sacrificed to the costume party. Done right, the experience can be intoxicating. In this way, executive producer-director Martin Scorsese and producer-writer Terence Winter (of 'The Sopranos') have given HBO viewers a lavish journey to the Atlantic City of 1920 in 'Boardwalk Empire' _ all expenses handsomely, even extravagantly, paid, minus your premium cable bill. They have, as literally as possible, relocated a group of actors and sets into the past, down to every last gauzy, color-rich detail, even down to the fascinating close-ups of the pages of a pristine copy of Vogue that a main character flips through while she waits in a lobby. Premiering on an extremely proud HBO Sunday night to wild _ and almost critic- proof, frankly _ expectations, the 12-part series accomplishes everything it sets out to do. This is not to say that 'Boardwalk Empire' doesn't suffer in patches. The first six episodes (which I've watched, dutifully at times) draw you in but sometimes feel overstuffed, overproduced and weirdly gauzy where the series means to be an exercise in crisp, razor-sharp filmmaking. It all unfolds like a dream, which can have an occasional Ambien effect; in some scenes the mind drifts so subtly (looking at set details; or a beautiful buck in the woods who passes by in the edge of headlights) that you are not certain of what you were supposed to get out of what you just saw. 'Boardwalk Empire' demands its viewers' attention, while insisting on viewers' reverence _ which can be an odd, even churchy, turnoff. There is such a thing as too perfect, right? Or maybe not. Strapped to a chair and forced to choose, I'd rather have 'Boardwalk Empire's' excess perfection over 90 percent of the fall TV shows in the offing. Steve Buscemi is nothing short of remarkable in the lead role of corrupt Atlantic City treasurer Enoch 'Nucky' Thompson (a composite character drawn in part from Nelson Johnson's history book, 'Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City,' from which the series is adapted). Scorsese directed the first episode, and he is clearly besotted with the very idea of Nucky, who is corrupt to the bone and weaselly in intent and appearance. Buscemi's buggy eyes have never been put to better use. Gleefully flouting Prohibition and taking a sizable cut of everything without a trace of remorse, Nucky is also a writer's dream, a tortured soul given to lingering in front of the boardwalk shopfront window where people in the 1920s paid 25 cents to look at sickly infants in incubators. ('See babies that weight less than 3 pounds!' the sign reads, just another example of the stray bits of history that pop up through 'Boardwalk Empire' like lovely prizes.) These moments of moral conflict are fleeting. And as hard as he works, Buscemi is also abused by screenplays that demand he appear in scene after scene, here and then there, huffing and puffing during a romp with his girlfriend (Paz de la Huerta) and then meeting with his goons and then helping a poor widow from the Temperance League (Kelly Macdonald), who hasn't yet figured out that Nucky is the one who had her husband killed. Yet again, an HBO drama series announces itself on the strength of its wide array of male characters _ including Michael Pitt as Jimmy Darmody, a returned doughboy vet with a complicated relationship to Nucky; Michael Shannon as a federal Prohibition agent with personal demons _ only to find that the women are the more interesting characters. Macdonald, as the widow Margaret Schroeder, quickly emerged as my favorite character in 'Boardwalk Empire,' synthesizing so much thematic detail about the era's twining of idealistic teetotaling and the women's suffrage movement. Gretchen Mol is good, too, as Gillian, a nightclub dancer (and Jimmy's mother) beginning to realize she's past her prime. All of these women must of course pay the price for appearing in a boutique HBO project _ at one point or another there will come the nude scene, and as likely, the carnal bouncing while astride one of their male co-stars. The rap on HBO (not from me) is that the network has come up short in its quest to replace 'The Sopranos,' which departed in 2007 in a singularly ambiguous moment of ordering onion rings in a diner. Elite American pop culture consumers have always had an outsize appetite for stories about the underworld of organized crime. Vampires come and go, but Vito Corleone will be with us always. In this regard, 'Boardwalk Empire' is the strongest reassertion that stories about gangsters, mobsters and other morally conflicted, dark-spirited felons in the Northeast corridor of the United States belong to a one-page list of directors, writers and even actors _ a family syndicate, if you will. Scorsese and a few others are at the top of it, even when it seems that the auteur's direction in 'Boardwalk Empire's' premiere episode verges at times on parodying his own style. You mess with the list (or attempt your own mob project) at your own peril. 'Boardwalk Empire' partakes heartily in the violence and cruelty that accompany the genre. Viewers wouldn't have it any other way _ blood must spatter; Mrs. Schroeder's missing, abusive husband turns up swollen and purple in a fishing net, thanks to Nucky Thompson; displeasure in one's employees is often best expressed at point-blank range. Fans of such shows and movies insist that what they are really interested in are interiors, not of skulls but of souls. That's what 'Boardwalk Empire' ends up being most of all _ an irresistible trip back in time and also a trip into the worst realm of human nature. - - - 'Boardwalk Empire' (70-minute premiere) debuts Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO.

1,"Wells Fargo & Co. has agreed to pay $100 million to Citigroup Inc. to settle a dispute related to its acquisition of Wachovia Corp. in October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. Wachovia was teetering on the brink of collapse from bad real estate loans when it initially agreed to be bought by Citigroup in a deal supported by the U.S. government. Days later, Wells Fargo swooped in with a sweeter deal and snatched Wachovia away from Citigroup. An irate Citi sued Wells soon thereafter, leading to the settlement announced Friday. Citigroup, in its lawsuit filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accused Wells and Wachovia of breach of contract and sought $60 billion in damages. The loss of Wachovia provided a window into Citigroup's own weak position at the time. In the weeks following the deal, Citigroup itself was brought to its knees as losses from bad investments mounted. Citi took in a total of $45 billion in bailout money from the U.S. government. The government has been reducing its stake in the bank this year, but still owns about 12 percent of Citigroup. The $100 million settlement represent a small fraction of the earnings and cash hoard of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which is one of the largest banks in the U.S. Wells earned $3.15 billion in the third quarter and had $16 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30. Its shares edged up 2 cents to $27.53 in afternoon trading Friday. "
1,"For his critics, President Hamid Karzai's inaugural speech struck all the right notes -- sober pledges to get tough on corruption and strengthen his own security forces so foreign troops can start going home. The question now is whether he has the will and ability to deliver. As he embarks on his second five-year term, Karzai faces a virulent Taliban insurgency and crippling corruption that has sown resentment among Afghans toward his administration -- and toward the Western powers that have supported it for eight years. The West, too, has become resentful, with questions increasingly raised back home why the roughly 103,000 U.S. and other NATO-led troops in Afghanistan are being asked to die for a corrupt and inefficient government. Such concerns are central to the debate inside the Obama administration, which is considering military proposals to send 10,000 to 40,000 additional troops to Afghanistan next year. A subdued Karzai, in his traditional green-striped robe, stayed close to his written text -- a departure from his usually relaxed and extemporaneous style. There was none of the excitement and anticipation of his first inauguration in 2004, when hopes were high that Afghanistan had finally turned a corner. Hundreds of Afghanistan's political and social elite attended the ceremony in the cavernous hall, lined with portraits of Afghan kings, warriors and academics. Men with long beards and expansive turbans sat among others who were clean-shaven and wearing suits, along with women whose heads were covered with scarves, some glittering with sequins. Dignitaries from across Afghanistan and the world listened intently for the promises of crucial reforms. And Karzai delivered -- at least in words. 'We have to learn from the mistakes and shortcomings of the past eight years,' he said. 'It is through this self-evaluation that we can better respond to the aspirations and expectations of our people.' Western criticisms had been unusually harsh -- and public -- leading up to his inauguration, particularly after an election so marred by fraud that it took nearly three months to produce a result. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who dined with Karzai on the eve of the ceremony, had warned that U.S. military and financial support would dry up without reforms. Speaking after the ceremony, Clinton praised Karzai's plans to fight corruption -- but also said attention would now turn to his actions. 'He could have been very vague and talked about how we're all against it and all want to end it but he was much more specific,' she said. 'And we're going to, along with the people of Afghanistan, watch very carefully to see how that's implemented.' As part of efforts to combat graft, Karzai said a law would be adopted under which senior government officials, including deputy ministers and governors, would have to register their assets. Until now, only ministers and higher-ranking officials were required to do so. He also said any government employees connected to the cultivation and trafficking of drugs would be dismissed and prosecuted. Clinton acknowledged such efforts would not be easy. 'We are under no illusions about the difficulties of this mission,' she said. Another of Karzai's harsh critics, Britain, which has the second-largest contingent of troops in the country after the United States, also had words of praise -- tinged with a warning. 'We've got the words now from President Karzai, we've got his commitments,' Foreign Secretary David Miliband said after the ceremony. 'It's words that have to be turned into deeds. ... Words are good, we've got a clear plan, but now we need to see it implemented.' Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown said recently that his country would not continue risking the lives of its soldiers to defend a corrupt regime. And while Karzai still desperately needs the foreign troops to battle the Taliban, he insisted that within half a decade, it would be Afghanistan's own army and police who would be in charge, with international forces providing only support and training. 'We are determined that by the next five years, the Afghan forces are capable of taking the lead in ensuring security and stability across the country,' Karzai said. He also took aim at the private security firms used by many embassies, international charities and high-ranking local officials, saying they must shut down within two years. But some fear a five-year timeframe is unrealistic given the poor state of Afghan security forces and the sophistication and viciousness of the insurgents. Even as the ceremony took place in Kabul, a suicide bomber killed two U.S. service members in the southern province of Zabul, local officials and NATO said. Hours later, another suicide bomber blew himself up in a busy marketplace in another province, killing 10 civilians, including three boys, and wounding 13 other people. 'If you want the quality of this army to be solid enough so that it's self-sustained and relatively independent, it will take at least 10 years,' said Candace Rondeaux, an analyst for the Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group. Speaking earlier this month, the commander for international forces in southern Afghanistan, Dutch Maj. Gen. Mart C. de Kruif, painted a grim picture of the task of training an army while fighting an insurgency. 'Building the Afghan National Army is like learning to fly while building the plane,' he said. For their part, the Taliban rejected Karzai's inauguration as meaningless, saying they would not accept his call for national unity. 'Today is not a historic day. This is a government based on nothing because of the continuing presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan,' spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said. Wadir Safi, a political science professor at Kabul University, said that while the speech struck the right cord for the international community, few Afghans could believe him. 'It is just for the satisfaction of the Western nations,' Safi said, arguing that Karzai has welcomed too many people with questionable ties into his administration to paint himself as a reformer. Mohammed Qasim Fahim, Karzai's first vice president, has repeatedly denied charges of ties to drug dealers and stealing state money when he was last in the government. Prominent adviser Gen. Rashid Dostum is a warlord under investigation for human rights abuses. But the head of Afghanistan's human rights commission said the speech was along the right tracks. 'The speech was good because he said we need action,' said Sima Samar. 'He can deliver if there is a political will -- but not just on his part, also on the part of the international community.' Still, for 20-year-old Kabul shopkeeper Habibullah, who gathered with friends to watch the ceremony on television, Karzai was full of promises he had heard before. 'I remember the previous swearing in five years ago -- people are still suffering. Security is bad. Life has not improved,' he said. 'Nothing has changed between this time and before. You should only have to promise once.' ------ Associated Press writers Heidi Vogt, Amir Shah and Deb Riechmann in Kabul, and Noor Khan in Kandahar contributed to this report. "

1,"The New South Wales Waratahs moved into first place in rugby's Super 14 tournament with a 40-17 win over South Africa's Cheetahs on Saturday. The Waratahs are level with the defending champion Bulls from South Africa with 28 points each, but lead on points differential. The Bulls lost their first match of the season after six straight wins when they were defeated 32-17 by the Auckland Blues earlier Saturday. The Waratahs led 23-3 at halftime. Rob Horne, in the 26th minute, capitalized on a clean break by his center partner Berrick Barnes, and prop Benn Robinson scored after the halftime siren had sounded. Flyhalf Daniel Halangahu added both conversions, plus penalty goals in the ninth, 18th and 37th minutes for a five-from-five record in the opening half. Waratahs front rower Al Baxter celebrated his 100th Super match with his first try for his team. Baxter, Australia's most-capped prop with 69 tests, crossed in the 44th minute as the Waratahs scored five tries to clinch a bonus point. 'It's fun to score, but I don't think my main job out there is to be running down the sideline like a winger scoring tries,' said Baxter, whose one and only try for the Wallabies came in his 50th test, against Canada at the 2007 World Cup in France. 'I'm one for milestones. No, I'm a front-rower and tighthead prop, so it's set piece first and foremost, and hard yards around the field.' Replacement halfback Josh Holmes added the final New South Wales try in the 78th minute, which man-of-the-match Berrick Barnes converted to complete the win. The Cheetahs scored two late consolation tries through prop W.P. Nel and reserve Corne Uys. Center Meyer Bosman converted both to add to a first-half penalty goal by flyhalf Naas Olivier. Cheetahs coach Naka Drotske was impressed with the Waratahs. 'They can definitely win this competition, there's no doubt about,' Drotske said. 'They win their close games, and if you want to win this competition, you need to do that. It's not easy to score tries against them and they showed that tonight.' ------ Scores: New South Wales 40 (Alastair Baxter, Kurtley Beale, Josh Holmes, Robert Horne, Benn Robinson tries; Daniel Halangahu 2, Berrick Barnes conversions; Halangahu 3 penalties), Cheetahs 17 (W.P. Nel, Corne Uys tries; Meyer Bosman 2 conversions, Naas Olivier penalty). HT: 23-3. "
1,"Federal troops stormed a seaside vacation home and captured one of the country's most brutal drug lords Tuesday, the second time in less than a month that Mexico has taken down one of its most powerful traffickers. The arrest was considered another victory for enhanced electronic surveillance techniques that are being cultivated with the assistance of the United States. American anti-drug officials had been helping Mexican authorities track Teodoro Garcia Simental for more than five months. Garcia, known as 'El Teo,' was arrested before dawn near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, where his gang had been bringing in planeloads of drugs to smuggle across the U.S. border, said Ramon Eduardo Pequeno, head of the federal police's anti-drug unit. Garcia, in his mid-30s, is connected to the deaths of at least 300 people, authorities say, and ordered his rivals disposed of in especially grisly ways: beheading them, hanging their bodies from bridges or dissolving them in caustic soda. He is also believed to be behind many of the dozens of assassinations of Tijuana police officers over the last two years. Pequeno said Garcia had recently stepped up efforts to kill Baja California's attorney general, Rommel Morena, and Tijuana's public safety chief, Julian Leyzaola. President Felipe Calderon launched an all-out war upon taking office in December 2006, sending thousands of troops out to combat the drug gangs. But until recently the government had little success in taking down the top kingpins, and Mexicans have been growing increasingly frustrated with a war that has left more than 15,000 casualties. That changed on Dec. 16, when another drug lord, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a raid by Mexican marines in the colonial city of Cuernavaca, just south of Mexico City. Authorities said U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials had been helping them track Beltran Leyva as well. On Jan. 2, federal officials arrested his brother, Carlos Beltran Leyva. 'The government is being more subtle with regard to its pursuit of drug traffickers,' said George W. Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. 'It's relying much more on electronic techniques, eavesdropping, inspection of one's lifestyle. It's also paying pretty good money to informants.' U.S. Ambassador Carlos Pascual said Garcia's arrest shows the sharing of information between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement is producing results. 'Mexico's operational capacity is growing,' Pascual said in a statement. 'We continue to improve our sharing of information. The Mexican government is unrelenting in its determination and commitment.' More than 150 federal troops raided a two-story, vacation home near the city of La Paz, shooting at the door and then barging in, said a neighbor who asked not to be identified out of fear the gang could retaliate. The troops quickly escorted Garcia and another man out of the home and into SUVs. Police seized two rifles, 19 mobile phones, two laptop computers and more than $35,000 in Mexican and U.S. currency, Pequeno said. Garcia appeared with authorities in Mexico City looking much heavier than in the two photos that have been widely circulated. Another alleged trafficker, Diego Raymundo Guerrero, was also detained. Garcia rose through the ranks of the Arellano Felix cartel in Tijuana but later broke from the group and forged his own operation, Pequeno said. The break set off a battle with his former gang members that plunged the city into a period of unprecedented violence, with more than 1,500 murders since the beginning of 2008. In Tijuana, he ruled by ordering the killings of drug dealers who betrayed him, and buying off corrupt officials. The arrest marks one of the most significant blows to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel under Calderon -- assuming that the Mexican government's claims linking Garcia to that cartel are correct, said David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Transborder Institute. Mexican officials say Garcia was the cartel's point man in wresting control of the Baja California peninsula from the rival Arellano Felix cartel. Garcia represents a new generation of Mexican drug traffickers who are much more savage than their predecessors, Shirk said. 'They play by a different set of rules, or maybe no rules, in terms of how they relate to their rivals,' he said. Shirk speculated that the arrest of Garcia could be a result of intelligence gleaned from the capture of Arturo Beltran Leyva and other leaders of that organization. 'It's quite possible that Beltran Leyva -- no friend of the Sinaloa cartel -- gave up information that helped track down El Teo,' he said. He said the arrest could also reflect a strategy to hit several cartels at once. That could also bolster public support for Calderon's fight among Mexicans who had been growing frustrated over the escalating violence. ---------- Associated Press writers Ignacio Martinez in La Paz, and Catherine Shoichet and Julie Watson in Mexico City contributed to this report. "
1,"BOSTON -- One of the most old-fashioned ways of measuring value is one of my favorites. I like to search for stocks selling for less than book value. Today, with fear outweighing greed on most investors' mental scales, there are quite a few candidates. Of approximately 1,500 U.S. stocks with a market value of $1 billion or more, 117 were selling below book value last week. Two of them I like are Loews and WellPoint. A couple of smaller companies worth considering are Bristow Group and Radian Group. Book value is corporate net worth -- a company's assets minus its liabilities. The price-to-book ratio is the ratio of a stock's price to the company's book value per share. In normal conditions I look for ratios of less than two. Today I see many candidates below 1.5 and some at less than one. A low price-to-book ratio doesn't guarantee a stock will go up. But studies by both academics and professionals show that a low ratio tips the odds in an investor's favor. One of my favorites in this group is Loews, which languishes at 0.8 times book value and eight times earnings. In the past year or so, I've written favorably about two of the company's publicly traded subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corp. and Diamond Offshore Drilling. New York-based Loews is a diversified holding company controlled by the Tisch family. Over the years, it has held large stakes in media, tobacco and energy companies, among others. Today, CNA, an insurance holding company, and Diamond Offshore, a deepwater oil driller, are the two main operating subsidiaries. Loews owns 90 percent of the former and 50.4 percent of the latter. Diamond had an impressive 39 percent return on equity last year. CNA hasn't performed as well, earning only 4 percent on equity in its last fiscal year. But the company has potential to improve: It swung to a profit in 2009 from a loss in 2008, and is expected to show earnings increases this year and next. Investors who have moral objections to the tobacco industry can take comfort in the fact that Loews spun off Lorillard in 2008. However, I believe that Loews could still be liable in tobacco liability lawsuits under some circumstances. WellPoint, the nation's largest health insurer in terms of enrollment, is based in Indianapolis and operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states. It also offers health coverage under other plans, plus dental and vision insurance, pharmacy benefits, life insurance and disability insurance. Is WellPoint harmed by the new health-care law? Definitely. In particular, I believe that the new requirements that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions will prove onerous. But when a stock sells at very cheap multiples, it makes up for a lot of onerous situations. WellPoint shares trade for just under book value, at eight times earnings and 0.4 times revenue. Turning to smaller-capitalization companies, here are two that I find appealing. Houston-based Bristow Group flies helicopters that take workers and equipment to and from offshore oil drilling rigs. Since mid-March, Bristow shares have dropped from a bit more than $40 to about $31. Bristow is not dependent on the Gulf of Mexico, where a partial drilling moratorium is in effect. It gets less than a third of its revenue from the U.S. The biggest chunk comes from Europe, and substantial amounts come from West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Shuttling personnel and tools to offshore rigs worldwide should keep Bristow and its peers busy the next two or three years. I'll close with a highly speculative pick --- one of the riskiest I have ever recommended, but with potential for a dramatic gain. It is Radian Group, a Philadelphia insurer that specializes in mortgage insurance and municipal-bond insurance. Radian went through the wringer during the housing-and-mortgage crisis and the recession of 2007 to 2009. After posting profits from 1990 through 2006, it lost $1.3 billion in 2007, $411 million in 2008 and $148 million in 2009. Most analysts expect further losses in 2010 and 2011. Yet Radian's balance sheet is in fairly decent shape, with debt only 74 percent of equity. Last month Radian managed to sell $550 million in stock. Disclosure note: I currently have no long or short positions in the stocks discussed in this week's column, personally or for clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Thunderstorm Capital in Boston. "
1,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has referred its investigation of Goldman Sachs to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution, less than two weeks after filing a civil securities fraud case against the firm, according to a source familiar with the matter. Any probe by the Justice Department would be in a preliminary stage. No Goldman Sachs employees involved in the mortgage-related transactions that are the focus of the SEC case have been interviewed by Justice Department prosecutors or the FBI agents who often conduct probes on behalf of prosecutors, according to a source familiar with the matter. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The Justice Department usually investigates high-profile cases of securities fraud, but the threshold from criminal prosecution is significantly higher than that of civil cases. The SEC only files civil cases. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported Thursday night that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan had followed up on the request and opened a criminal probe. The office declined to comment. 'Given the recent focus on the firm, we're not surprised by the report of an inquiry,' said Goldman spokesman Lucas Van Praag. 'We would cooperate fully with any request for information.' It is very rare for the government to indict a firm, and the mere threat of criminal prosecution can destroy a company. A criminal investigation destroyed the Wall Street firm Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s even though the firm settled with authorities. And although the Supreme Court ultimately overturned the conviction, accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after facing criminal charges in connection with the Enron corporate corruption in the early 2002. In that case, the justices said that lower courts had given juries far too broad principles by which to decide whether to convict the company. The decision, lawyers at the time said, would make it more difficult for prosecutors to bring criminal cases against corporations. The SEC claims the firm and an employee named Fabrice Tourre broke the law and committed fraud when they sold clients a complex investment linked to the value of home loans that was secretly designed to fail. Another firm, Paulson & Co., a hedge fund, helped Goldman create the investment and planned to bet against it. But the SEC claims that relationship was not disclosed to Goldman's clients, ACA Financial Guaranty and the German bank IKB. Goldman has steadfastly rejected charges that it committed securities fraud. Tourre has also denied the charges. Goldman says ACA and IKB were sophisticated investors and disclosure of Paulson's role was not legally required. Proving a criminal case could be challenging given that prosecutors must show 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that Goldman and its employees committed fraud, compared to the threshold for a civil case, which only requires a 'preponderance of evidence.' Under civil law, the SEC doesn't have to prove Goldman set out to defraud investors _ only that it did. But criminal law would require that prosecutors show that Goldman maliciously planned to mislead its investors. Since the SEC filed its lawsuit earlier this month, securities lawyers have debated the merits of the agency's case, with most agreeing that it represents an ambitious legal theory that big financial firms that knew they were engaging in speculative betting on home loans were defrauded because Paulson's role was not disclosed. Goldman also says ACA was told about Paulson's role, and the firm has written a letter to its investors strongly suggesting that was the case. The Justice Department suffered a setback earlier this year when a case against two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers failed. A jury rejected securities fraud charges against the hedge fund managers, who ran funds linked to subprime mortgages, after presenting evidence that the men knew about risks in the market but didn't disclose these to investors. The SEC is still pursuing the Bear Stearns case. "
1,"Philippine troops and police searched Monday for a 78-year-old Irish missionary after heavily armed men abducted him from the garden of his residence in the country's volatile south. The six gunmen dragged the Rev. Michael Sinnott into a van in front of his horrified aides inside the Columban House compound in Pagadian city, Zamboanga del Sur province, late Sunday, regional police commander Angelo Sunglao said. 'They could not do anything because the abductors had powerful weapons,' Sunglao told The Associated Press. No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, but suspicion fell on Muslim guerrillas who have been fighting for a separate homeland in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south for decades and have in the past kidnapped foreigners, including priests. The abductors took Sinnott away by sea on a motorboat toward a town called Tukuran, Sunglao said, citing fishermen who saw the abduction. The van was later found abandoned and burned near the Catholic mission house. Police and troops were mobilized to search the area, said military spokesman Maj. Ramon David Hontiveros. Al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf militants and insurgents from the larger Moro Islamic Liberation Front have a presence in the vast Zamboanga peninsula, but Sunglao said it was too early to pinpoint any group. Sinnott's group, the Missionary Society of St. Columban, confirmed his abduction, saying he was taking an evening stroll in the convent's garden when he was taken by the gunmen. The group appealed for prayers for his safe recovery. The Columban regional director, Patrick O'Donoghue, said he was worried because Sinnott has a heart condition and was not carrying his medication when he was taken. Sinnott has worked in the Philippines for decades. The group said he was first assigned in the southern Philippines between 1957-66, then returned in 1976. He has been involved in a school for handicapped children since 1998. Several priests have been kidnapped in recent years in the region. Mostly recently, an Italian priest, Giancarlo Bossi, was kidnapped allegedly by members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Abu Sayyaf in nearby Zamboanga Sibugay province in June 2007. He was freed after 39 days. The rebel front denied any involvement. The government then denied speculation that a ransom was paid to win Bossi's release. The 11,000-strong Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has been engaged in on-and-off peace talks with the government, has denied any involvement in kidnappings for ransom or any alliance with the smaller and more violent Abu Sayyaf. The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have about 400 fighters. U.S. and Philippine security officials say it has received funds from al-Qaida and is suspected of sheltering militants from the larger Southeast Asian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah. "
1,"History is usually made by a small group of passionate people. On Dec. 7, history was made by a small group of parents in Compton, Calif. Their children attend McKinley Elementary School - a school that has been defined as failing for the past 10 years. Using a new power known as the 'parent trigger,' which I fought for and state legislators approved last year, these Compton parents banded together to demand change. The legislation allows parents of students at troubled schools to demand such significant reforms as closing a school, replacing a school's management or most of its staff, or reorganizing a school into a charter, if 51 percent of parents sign a petition. McKinley Elementary is being reorganized and will soon be transformed into a charter school run by Celerity Educational Group, which is successfully operating three other schools in California. Some have called this action 'the shot heard across the country' - and they're not overstating the case. To get some perspective of the scope of this new power, consider the heartwrenching stories brought to public attention this year in the documentary 'Waiting for Superman,' which focuses on the failures of our public education system. Without the power of the trigger legislation, parents whose children are in what the documentary and others call 'dropout factories' have only one avenue to save their children. They must win a lottery to get them into a highly performing charter school. Across the country, millions of families' prayers go unanswered. These parents are left to face the bleak reality that their child will be forever stuck in a failing school and a failing system. The exit doors may as well be chained. For millions of low-income families, this means that their child is doomed to a life of unrealized potential. For millions of California families, this is the shattering of the American dream. Now, however, for the first time in California history, these historically underserved parents have new power and new choice. The package of reforms I signed in January gives parents significant options for changing their child's school as well as the freedom to leave failing schools or send their child to a new school or even a new district. Schools are eligible for the 51 percent trigger if they have been judged under state standards to have shown no progress for three consecutive years. While leaders of the State Teachers Union have threatened legal action to try to stop parents from using this groundbreaking power, I am confident that if they try to thwart the public, the courts will end up upholding this important bipartisan legislation. Changes such as replacing a school's principal and staff do not come unless there have been continued years of failure and a majority of parents banding together and signing a petition. This sort of majority-demanded restructuring is exactly what just happened at McKinley Elementary School. More than 60 percent of McKinley parents signed a petition and chose to convert to a charter school. Throughout history, all great movements have started at the grass-roots level, with ordinary citizens and communities rising up to demand change. In California, like in many other states, our public education system is not based on merit or holding the adults in whose care we have placed our children accountable. Some students get a good education, but others do not, and report after report reaches the same conclusion: No matter how much money we throw at the problem, unless the school is fundamentally fixed, we will not get the results in student performance we all deserve. Giving parents the power to hold their schools accountable is a giant step forward, and I believe that what happened in Compton is the beginning of a movement that will sweep the nation.

1,"Thwarted in his campaign to set government control over consumer access to the Internet, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski has been trying to salvage his efforts by negotiating directly with a handful of the biggest Web firms and network service providers. His goal is for those firms to put aside their differences on how Internet service providers control content on their networks and agree on legislation that Genachowski can present to Congress. But critics say that by handpicking Google, AT&T, Verizon and Skype for seven closed-door meetings that continue this week at the FCC, Genachowski could be determining the future of how consumers access the Web in a manner more favorable to those businesses. Massive corporate interests are at stake as the firms and the agency discuss so- called net neutrality provisions, or regulations that would prevent Internet providers from blocking or slowing access to websites. The talks could determine, for instance, whether Verizon could provide YouTube online video with better resolution than competitor Netflix, or whether Google and Skype have to pay extra to get their online voice services onto AT&T broadband networks. 'These big companies can make deals for themselves, but they are leaving out the rest of us,' said Susan Crawford, a communications law professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Genachowski's chief of staff, Eddie Lazarus, has been running the meetings and said he has also talked to dozens of consumer groups, start-ups, venture capitalists and smaller network operators. Those discussions have taken place outside the hours-long sessions with officials from the four firms, a cable trade association and a coalition advocating Genachowski's so-called net neutrality rules. 'That one room is not privileged, in my view. There have been dozens of stakeholder discussions with varied interests who are all important to this process,' Lazarus said. Free Press, Public Knowledge, Amazon.com and Sony Electronics are among parties represented by the Open Internet Coalition, which has a place at the meetings. Cable firms are also represented by a trade group, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. 'I can't presume to speak for all of them on any given issue,' said Markham Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, which also represents Google. 'We try to be a consensus-based coalition, but the challenge is that there is a diversity of points of view on any given issue when you get to very specific points.' Matt Polka, president of American Cable Association, a group that represents smaller cable broadband operators, said he agrees with the National Cable and Telecommunications Association that the FCC shouldn't pursue so-called open- Internet rules. But, he said, 'you have to hope that the interests of smaller rural providers are also being represented in these discussions and not just biggest cable firms.' Analysts said agreements made between those parties could encourage Congress to introduce legislation as the FCC grapples with questions over its ability to regulate broadband providers. Wireless partners Google and Verizon are close to announcing an agreement on ground rules that they hope to hold as an example of successful self-regulation, according to sources familiar with those negotiations. As early as Monday, the firms are expected to announce a deal that would prevent Verizon from offering more room on its networks to those who pay more. But any promises of open- Internet access wouldn't apply to mobile phones, sources close to the companies said. Google and Verizon declined to comment. The two firms have stood on opposite ends of the net neutrality debate but have partnered on Android phones, based on Google's operating system and applications. In recent months, Verizon chief executive Ivan Seidenberg and Google chief Eric Schmidt have announced in op-eds and speeches that they are finding 'common ground' in the debate. Such an agreement could frame discussion on legislation in Congress. And it would enable Genachowski to address his biggest policy goal _ open Internet access _ without having to follow through on a separate, controversial proposal to redefine broadband access providers as telecommunications services. That promise of open-Internet rules was touted by President Barack Obama during his election campaign but was derailed by a federal court decision that questioned the FCC's authority over broadband. And amid growing opposition in Congress, the FCC has sought to find a way out by asserting its authority to regulate broadband. "
1,"On the night of May 26, I drove down to Washington from New York with my son, Adam, and his friend Daniel. We arrived at 2:30 a.m. and crashed out in a hotel. A few hours later, we woke up and coaxed each other to prepare for a day at the White House. The president was hosting a Jewish American heritage celebration, and we'd been able to get media credentials to cover the event. We were exhausted, but thrilled. The day began with security checks. Then to the subterranean press room. A glimpse of former president Bill Clinton scurrying by with Vice President Biden. A press conference in the East Room with President Obama. An impromptu interview with the White House's mashgiach, the supervisor of the kosher kitchen preparation. Adam and Daniel were documenting the events for their Jewish teen Web site, ShmoozePOINT.com. I was interviewing people about Israel for a feature on my Web site, RabbiLIVE.com. I thought that if I could create videos of short anecdotes about Israel _ the food, archeology, history and personal experiences _ they might go viral on the Internet and be a nice promo campaign for the country. I had started the project just a few weeks before. Even as a rabbi, I did not count on divine intervention. We were on the White House front lawn when I told the teenagers that approaching us was the most famous reporter in the world _ Helen Thomas, a veteran of covering presidents from Kennedy to Obama. We stopped her. I told Thomas that the young men were starting out in the press corps and hoped to be reporters. She kindly shared notes about journalism with us. 'You'll always keep learning,' she told us. It was an honor. Then I asked: 'Any comments on Israel? We're asking everybody today.' Like saying a password to enter a new, secret place. 'Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine,' she replied, '... and go home' to Poland and Germany. We were in. The repartee and gentle give and take have now been broadcast, transcribed and thoroughly dissected. However, a strict transcription misses the accuracy of the audiovisual. Only in the director's cut, the video, are the nonwords, the sound, the noise, the true reaction. And that was my 'oooh.' 'What were you thinking when you said `oooh,' rabbi?' asked Fox News, and eventually, the many other national and international media outlets that probed and jabbed for my innermost thoughts. Well _ I was thinking 'oooh.' Oooh. Most heard it even the first time. Certainly during the multitude of reruns, 'oooh' became part of the song. It was a reaction by a rabbi to Thomas's comments, and it was from my soul. I merely asked a question with a video camera to a columnist. She answered me with an opinion that was unacceptable not just to me but to former and current press secretaries, politicians, the president, her agent, her co-author and many people in the world. Her freedom of speech was not stifled; on the contrary, it was respected. She didn't say that the blockade was unjust, or that the supplies were not getting to Gaza, or that there was a massacre on the high seas, or that East Jerusalem is occupied, or that the settlements are immoral ... and get out and go back to West Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa and Eilat. No. This was not the two-state solution. This was get the hell out and go back to the places of the final solution, Poland and Germany. The Jew has no connection with the land of Israel. And why? Because, as Thomas went on to explain to me, 'I'm from Arab descent.' That's it? That's all you got? Do we all just travel with only our parents' stereotypes to guide us, never going beyond them to get to a peaceful destination? In the past weeks I have relived this moment over and over, with television, radio, newspapers and blogs. I've listened to a constant stream of commentary. And my sharpest impression is this: Where before I saw a foggy question of an anti-Israel, anti-Jewish link, it's now clear. It's not about statehood. It's about an ingrown, organic hate. It's a sentiment that bears no connection with history, dates, passages or verses. Erase the facts, the dates and the lore. Erase the Jew. Incredibly, even the Nazis would say to the Jew, 'Go home to Palestine.' They knew. But Thomas and a babbling stream in our world and country dictate to Jewish people to 'go home to Poland and Germany.' Yeah, I said 'Oooh.' My 'oooh' was the sound of the shofar ram's horn calling a loud primal tikeya, the extended ancient whole note from my very core. My existence was being erased. Every room in every Holiday Inn in America has, next to the bed, in the drawer, a Bible, next to the yellow pages and the breakfast menu. Christianity believes in the Jewish ancestry. Islam believes in the prophets Moses and Jesus. Their values and claims are rooted in an epic of a Jewish nation and her Jewish land. Can we just rip it out, like a Band-Aid, one quick motion across the centuries? Oooh. One may disagree on fences and rights of return. There have been handshakes, summits, accords, cease-fires, negotiations and boycotts. It's all been on the table, under the table or sometimes tabled. But the connection between the Jew and Israel is valid, historical, ancient, modern, spiritual and eternal. The relationship is beyond the state of Israel. It is a unique relationship of a religion to a land. The Jews are 'bnai yisroel,' the children of Israel. Even when they are away, they are connected. Even during exiles and diasporas, they are connected. Even during inquisitions, pogroms and a Holocaust, they are connected. My grandmother used to kibitz, 'Friends you choose; family you're stuck with.' The Jew is stuck with Israel. There is no ungluing the connection. It is beyond the ambiguous term 'chosen people'; they are 'the people who have no choice.' It is more than a religious belief; it is a value and a moral barometer of the Earth. History, truth, integrity and the foundation of our world are not negotiable. 'Tell them to get the hell out ...' We went back to the East Room for the Jewish event and then onto the South Lawn as Marine One carried away the first family for the Memorial Day weekend. We stopped in Maryland on the way home for some kosher shwarma. We had no idea: The New Jersey Turnpike looked the same, but we were already traveling on a road in a post-oooh world. David F. Nesenoff is a rabbi in New York. His Web site is RabbiLIVE.com. "

It also is the first death from the H5N1 strain of influenza reported outside the Americas by the World Health Organization in Geneva or the European Centers for Disease Control in Stockholm, which both keep tabs on confirmed cases of swine flu and deaths from the illness in countries around the world. Scotland's government said on Sunday night that a patient suffering from swine flu has died in a hospital there. It says the patient was one of 10 people being treated for swine flu there. Friday's last WHO report said 74 countries have officially reported 29,669 cases of swine flu, including 145 deaths in the Americas. "

1,"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday urged Vietnam to improve its human rights record but also pledged greater cooperation in dealing with the lingering impact of Agent Orange from the Vietnam War. In Hanoi to mark the 15th anniversary of normalized U.S.-Vietnam relations, Clinton praised her hosts for their 'extraordinary, dynamic population' and said it 'is on the path to becoming a great nation with an unlimited potential.' To fulfill that promise, though, she said the communist government must ease curbs on free speech and political activity. 'That is among the reasons we expressed concern about arrest and conviction of people for peaceful dissent, attacks on religious groups and curbs on Internet freedom,' she said in her opening comments at a joint news conference with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem. Clinton said the Obama administration wanted to work with Vietnam 'to support efforts to pursue reforms and protect basic rights and freedoms.' But how much Vietnam is willing to cooperate on that was unclear as Khiem said he thought the subject is 'a difference between Vietnam and the U.S.' 'Human rights have common values but ... it depends a lot on the cultural and historical background,' he said. He noted that President Barack Obama has said human rights values shouldn't be imposed from the outside. Later, at a lunch hosted by the local American Chamber of Commerce, Clinton raised human rights again, calling it a 'profound difference' between the U.S. and Vietnam even as trade and commerce have increased exponentially since relations were normalized in 1995, during her husband's administration. 'It is true that profound differences exist, particularly over the question of political freedoms,' she told the audience. 'The United States will continue to urge Vietnam to strengthen its commitment to human rights and give its people an even greater say over the direction of their own lives.' At the same time, Clinton said the U.S. does not see its relationship with Vietnam as rooted in differences or in memories of the past. 'We have learned to see each other not as former enemies but as actual and potential partners, colleagues and friends,' she said. 'We will continue to choose engagement and cooperation over escalation and division.' Clinton recalled her first visit to Vietnam in 2000, when she accompanied then-President Bill Clinton on a trip shortly before he left office. That trip was the first by a sitting U.S. president to Vietnam since the war ended in 1975. She said they had not known what to expect but were overwhelmed by the friendly welcome they received from the Vietnamese people. 'Everywhere we went we felt the warmth and hospitality of the Vietnamese people. For us, it had a profound impact,' she said. In her comments with Khiem, Clinton also promised to continue working with Vietnam on the consequences of Agent Orange. The U.S. military sprayed roughly 11 million gallons of the defoliant over large swaths of southern Vietnam between 1962 and 1971. Dioxin, a toxic chemical used in the herbicide, has been linked to cancers, birth defects and other ailments. Vietnam says as many as 4 million of its citizens were exposed to the herbicide and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses caused by it. A joint panel of U.S. and Vietnamese policymakers, citizens and scientists has urged Washington and other donors to provide $30 million annually over 10 years to clean up sites still contaminated by dioxin. Clinton said she and Khiem had discussed 'the concern that both Vietnam and the United States have about Agent Orange and the consequences it produced in the people here.' 'We have been working with Vietnam for about nine years to try to remedy the effects of Agent Orange,' Clinton said. She promised to 'increase our cooperation and make even greater progress together.' "
1,"Shortly after Terry Matthews left his native Wales for Canada in 1969, he started a venture importing electric lawnmowers from the United Kingdom. It quickly floundered, he said. The shipping company lost the delivery and the machines didn't arrive until October. 'You can't give lawnmowers away in October,' said Matthews, 66. 'Timing in life is almost everything.' Now Matthews, who became a billionaire from technology companies he started, sees opportunity for companies that can help wireless carriers relieve the strain on their networks from smartphones such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone. Among the 60 companies he has started or backed are a handful that make technology for wireless operators, including Dragonwave Inc. and Bridgewater Systems Corp. 'The drivers of change are mobile devices, mainly mobile phones,' said Matthews an interview in his modern office outside Ottawa. 'The bandwidth that's associated with that is dramatically increasing.' Dragonwave and Bridgewater, both based in Ottawa, have surged along with the data on wireless operators' networks. Dragonwave rose 10-fold last year, while Bridgewater more than tripled. Dragonwave supplies microwave radio products that link transmission towers to carriers' land-line networks; Bridgewater makes software to help Verizon Wireless and other customers ease data congestion. Several Matthews-backed startups are still private, including BenBria. This month, Mitel Networks Corp., a maker of telecom software and equipment started by Matthews, said it plans to raise as much as $211 million in an initial public offering. Matthews wouldn't discuss the IPO, citing restrictions of the current investor roadshow. Matthews' investments have been successful enough that in 1980 he bought the former Wales maternity hospital where he was born and developed the property into the Celtic Manor Resort with three golf courses, scheduled to play host to golf's Ryder Cup in October. The courses are 'full all the time,' said Matthews, who sold his Newbridge Networks Corp. to Alcatel-Lucent SA in 2000 for $7.2 billion. 'I don't play. It takes four hours.' Matthews sees his startup investments as part of a broader revival in the Canadian technology sector. Many local companies are being founded by former employees of Nortel Networks Corp., the telecom equipment maker that filed for bankruptcy last year. Dragonwave Chief Executive Officer Peter Allen and Bernard Herscovich, CEO of local startup BelAir Networks Inc., both worked at Nortel. 'You take a look at Ottawa and you'll say Nortel's melted down, well, true,' said Matthews. 'The fact of the matter is it is coming back. The activity level for new companies starting up is wild.' Last year, 222 startups were established in the nation's capital, according to the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation, while 215 firms were bought or went bust. Matthews sits on the boards of 12 companies and chairs 10 of them. 'The fact that Bridgewater and Dragonwave have succeeded reminds investors why technology investing can be a profitable enterprise,' said Mark McQueen, president of the Toronto-based venture capital firm Wellington Financial. The skills of the region's work force may be well suited to helping major carriers with network congestion, Matthews said. AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless., and other mobile-phone operators are looking for cost-effective ways to manage the surge in data traffic on their wireless networks. AT&T has said that traffic on its network has increased 50-fold in the past three years. The new companies haven't boosted total technology employment in the Ottawa area. The number of tech jobs slipped 1.3 percent last year to 78,067 according to the Ottawa Centre. Matthews' investment approach is to back companies that solve real problems for customers and have attracted customers willing to pay up for products. 'It's a fallacy to think that you take a pot, put very smart people in it, a ton of money and something's bound to come out,' he said. 'The important thing is to connect with clients. 'I start about five new companies a year. The typical amount I start a company with is a half a million dollars,' Matthews said. 'What I do is remove the speculative nature of the R&D by connecting with clients.' "
1,"Records show that about 47,000 people have been removed or deported from the U.S. after the Homeland Security Department sifted through 3 million sets of fingerprints taken from bookings at local jails. About a fourth of those kicked out of the country did not have criminal records, according to government data obtained by immigration advocacy groups that have filed a lawsuit. The groups plan to release the data Tuesday and provided early copies to The Associated Press. As issue is a fingerprint sharing program known as Secure Communities that the government says is focused on getting rid of the 'worst of the worst' criminal immigrants from the U.S. Immigration advocates say that the government instead spends too much time on lower level criminals or non-criminals. Immigration advocates have criticized the administration's description of the Secure Communities program as focused on ridding the 'worst of the worst' criminal immigrants from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement divides crimes into three categories, with Level 1 being the most serious. Most of those deported committed Level 2 or 3 crimes or were non-criminals, a monthly report of Secure Communities statistics shows. 'ICE has pulled a bait and switch, with local law enforcement spending more time and resources facilitating the deportations of bus boys and gardeners than murderers and rapists and at considerable cost to local community policing strategies, making us all less safe,' said Peter Markowitz, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Benjamin N. Cardozo law school in New York. Markowitz's clinic, the National Day Laborer's Organizers Network and the Center for Constitutional Rights had requested and sued for the statistics. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released some of the documents late Monday. Richard Rocha, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman, said non-criminals still may be people who have failed to show up for deportation hearings, people who recently crossed the border illegally or who re-entered the country after deportation. He also said it's important to remember that more people commit crimes that are considered Level 2 and 3. Secure Communities is 'a beneficial partnership tool for ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies helping to identify, prioritize and remove convicted criminal aliens not only from the communities, but also from the country,' Rocha said. The Obama administration wants Secure Communities operating nationwide by 2013. As of Aug. 3, 494 counties and local and state agencies in 27 states were sharing fingerprints from jail bookings through the program. From October 2008 through June of this year, 46,929 people identified through a fingerprint sharing program known as Secure Communities were removed from the U.S., the documents show. Of those, 12,293 were considered non-criminals. ------ Online: Immigration and Customs Enforcement: http://www.ice.gov "

1,"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined the United States Monday in ratcheting up pressure on North Korea by recommending U.N. Security Council action for a torpedo attack that kill 46 South Korean sailors. The South Korean U.N. chief called the evidence 'overwhelming and deeply troubling' that Pyongyang was responsible for the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan in the Yellow Sea off the west coast. He urged the 15-nation council, as the U.N.'s powerful body, to respond to one of South Korea's worst military disasters since the 1950-53 Korean War. The United States announced Monday it would conduct joint naval exercises with the South Koreans. 'My sincere hope is that this will be dealt with by the Security Council, and they should take necessary measures on this matter,' the U.N. chief told a news conference at U.N. headquarters. 'There must be some major step to be taken. The evidence is quite compelling. There is no controversy.' Ban came out hard-hitting about the torpedo that an international team of investigators concluded last week was fired from a North Korean submarine and tore the South Korean ship in two. But he repeatedly said he was pressing his global duties, rather than acting as a partisan because he is a former South Korean foreign minister. 'I try to be very objective and fair, reasonable,' he said. Any action by the 15-nation Security Council, the U.N.'s most powerful body, may depend on the outcome of negotiations between the U.S. and China, the veto-wielding permanent seat holder on the council with the most sway over North Korea. Indeed, already some 'very active consultations have been taking place among key members of the Security Council' on the ship sinking, Ban said. The U.N. chief's comments echo those of U.S. President Barack Obama, who offered his full support for South Korea's moves. The U.S. and South Korea are planning two major military exercises off the Korean Peninsula in a display of force intended 'to deter future aggression' by the North Korea, the White House said Monday. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak outlined economic and diplomatic measures against the impoverished Communist nation, including halting some trade. Ban said the team's evidence 'is overwhelming and deeply troubling. I fully share the widespread condemnation of the incident.' He did not elaborate on which details of the evidence he was referring to. Ban said it was 'particularly deplorable' that North Korea's attack occurred while talks to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons are stalled. China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. have been trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons in six party talks. The North quit the negotiations last year. 'Such an unacceptable act by the DPRK runs counter to international efforts to promote peace and stability in the region,' Ban said. Ban, like South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, called the attack the latest in a series of provocations from the North. Unfortunately, there have been several such provocations during the last four or five decades,' he said. 'This is one of the most serious, I believe, provocations in recent days.' South Korea, in response, is now aiming to strike Pyongyang financially by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in trade with isolated North Korea, which is in desperate need of hard currency. South Korea has been North Korea's No. 2 trading partner, behind China. 'You have seen such widespread condemnation from many countries around the world, and the evidence, the facts, lead out by this joint international investigation team were very compelling and overwhelming, Ban added. 'I have been personally very much troubled by what had happened there.' "
1,"The Obama administration will probe consolidation in the agriculture industry and enforce antitrust laws where it finds excessive market power hurting competition, Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday. Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack spoke in Ankeny, Iowa, at the first of five workshops on competition and regulation in the agriculture industry. Holder said they have already received 15,000 comments on the subject. 'Is today's agriculture industry suffering from a lack of free and fair competition in the marketplace?' Holder said to a standing-room crowd of about 700 people at a community college. 'That is the central question.' Consolidation in meat, packing and seed markets have lowered food prices while pressuring growers and threatening the life of rural economies, Vilsack said. Companies that abuse their dominant market position to hurt competition will face Justice Department action, said Christine Varney, head of the antitrust division. 'Big is not illegal,' Varney told reporters outside the workshop, when asked whether the administration plans to break up large companies. 'We are not looking to restructure the economy. We are looking to enforce the law wherever the facts take us.' The department is investigating whether patents on biotech seeds are being abused to extend or maintain companies' dominance in the industry, Varney said. The department is looking broadly at the intersection of patent and antitrust laws, she said. 'There is a very robust patent system in this country and if you are abusing a patent to extend or maintain a monopoly, that is not legal,' Varney said. 'We are looking at those very important issues.' Monsanto has begun switching seedmakers and growers from soybeans with the Roundup Ready gene, which was in 93 percent of U.S. soybean seeds last year, to the newer Roundup Ready 2 Yield version in advance of the original's patent expiration in 2014. DuPont Co., the second-biggest seed company, says Monsanto is using incentives and penalties to switch the industry to the new product in a way that unlawfully extends the Roundup Ready monopoly. Varney declined to comment more specifically on the focus of the probe. 'Monsanto's place in seed is something that is a competitive issue that is before all of us,' Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said. Iowa also is investigating the St. Louis-based company, he said. Holder said he will aggressively review mergers in the agriculture industry. He highlighted the Justice Department's Jan. 22 lawsuit against Dean Foods Co. over its acquisition of Foremost Farms USA's consumer-products division, saying the deal hurts competition in the sale of milk to schools and stores in several states. The partnership with the Department of Agriculture is meant to also address competition through regulation, Holder said. Vilsack highlighted concerns about increased concentration and integration in meat-packing and rapidly shrinking spot markets. 'Are farmers and ranchers in this country currently getting a fair shake? Is there sufficient transparency?' Vilsack said. 'Seed companies in some cases control the lion's share of market. Is that good or bad for farmers?' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he will explore legislative remedies to boosting competition. The cooperation between the Justice and Agriculture departments is unprecedented and 'fills a big void,' he said. "
1,"Security forces captured the Pakistani Taliban's top spokesman in an operation near the Afghan border, intelligence officials said Tuesday, dealing another blow to the militants following the reported killing of their leader earlier this month. The seizure of Mauvi Umar follows government claims of disarray in the leadership of the Taliban over who should replace their chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who is believed to have been killed in a CIA missile strike on Aug. 5. Umar was seized in a village in the Mohmand tribal region Monday night while he was traveling in a car with two associates to South Waziristan, a Taliban stronghold, three intelligence officials said. Local tribal elders assisted troops in locating Umar in the village of Khawazeo, the officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media. They said Umar's arrest would likely be publicly announced later Tuesday. Pakistan army or government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. As the official spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, the umbrella organization for various regional and tribal militant movements, Umar frequently called journalists to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He was known to be close to Mehsud. Last week he called The Associated Press to insist Mehsud was still alive and deny reports of a power struggle within the Pakistani Taliban's disparate factions over who would succeed him. Umar's capture was the second high-profile arrest of a senior Taliban figure in 24 hours. On Monday night, police said they had arrested a militant commander and close Mehsud aide who was being treated in a private hospital in Islamabad, the capital. Militant commander Qari Saifullah, who is reportedly linked to al-Qaida, told police he had been wounded in an American missile strike in South Waziristan, said two police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. It was unclear if it was the same strike believed to have killed Mehsud. Pakistan's Western allies are desperate to see a crackdown on militants threatening the stability of the nuclear-armed country as well as the success of the U.S. and NATO-led mission in neighboring Afghanistan, where violence is surging ahead of elections later this week. Visiting U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Sunday praised recent gains against the militants, including the reported death of Mehsud and the retaking of the Swat Valley, 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Islamabad, from the Taliban in July. ------ Associated Press Writer Habib Khan contributed to this report from Khar "
1,"Daihatsu Motor Co., a subsidiary of Toyota, is recalling over 880,000 minicars in Japan due to defective door mirrors. The recall of 882,006 cars was due to loose attachments that could cause the mirrors to fall off, Japan's transport ministry said Thursday. There have been no reports of accidents due to the defective mirrors. The recalled cars are only sold in Japan, the ministry said. Under Japanese law, automakers must inform the ministry of a recall. Toyota Motor Corp., the world's No. 1 automaker, owns 51.3 percent of Daihatsu. Mini vehicles are defined by specifications unique to Japan: maximum length of 3.4 meters (11.15 feet), width of 1.48 meters (4.86 feet), height of 2 meters (6.56 feet) and engine displacement of less than 660 cc. The category is hugely popular in Japan for its money-saving potential, including lower fuel costs and taxes. Minicars currently comprise about a third of Japan's annual vehicle sales. "

1,"For sheer corporate candor, it's tough to beat the latest Domino's delivery. In its new TV commercial and Web video, the pizza chain admits something startling _ namely, that its pizza is pretty terrible. ' `Worst excuse for pizza I ever had,' ' a company executive says grimly, quoting a customer's comment. ' `Totally devoid of flavor.' ' 'Domino's pizza crust to me is like cardboard,' says a woman in a clip taken from a focus-group panel. Another employee, who appears near tears, reads another review: ' `The sauce tastes like ketchup.' ' This is a way to win customers? The admission by Domino's of its own awfulness may be the most extreme form yet of the mea culpa ad, a kind of subgenre in which a company publicly confesses its defects and mistakes and vows to do better. Such ads make their sell only after they've hammered the advertiser itself. While Domino's never quite expresses regret, the crusty comments do set up the company's promise to improve, with better ingredients and a new pizza recipe. Airlines such as United and JetBlue have prostrated themselves in public to mollify travelers enraged by scheduling snafus. Fast-food outfits have done it, too; Hardee's trashed the poor quality of its hamburgers in an ad campaign a few years ago. Domestic car manufacturers have practically made an art of acknowledging their shortcomings; General Motors went on an apology tour starting in late 2008 when it began lobbying for billions of dollars in federal bailout funds. Last summer, as it went through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, it flooded the airwaves with a commercial that acknowledged, 'General Motors needs to start over in order to get stronger.' This week, as Domino's was rolling out its self-lacerating confession, the Chicago Bears took out newspaper ads to apologize to the team's fans for its subpar performance. 'In a season where we did not perform at our best, we are further humbled by the fact that our fans stepped up and did their part,' the ads said. (For the record, the Bears finished with a 7-9 record, considerably better than the 4-12 Redskins, who have yet to publish any apologies.) Domino's says its ad strategy wasn't prompted by crisis or underperformance (its market share has held steady through the recession). Rather, the company says it's knocking its pizza as a way to show that it's committed to doing better: 'We're proving to our customers that we are listening to them by brutally accepting the criticism that's out there,' says Patrick Doyle, the company's incoming chief executive, in an interview. Doyle appears in the new TV ad and Web video, looking perplexed and somewhat hurt by customers' negative assessments. He adds, 'We think that going out there and being this honest really breaks through to people in a way that most advertising does not.' Acknowledging that you've messed up may win some goodwill among consumers, but marketing experts say it also carries some risks. 'Some people are going to hear only part of the message' _ Domino's stinks _ 'and not hear the part about how they're going to get better,' says Bill Benoit, a communications professor at Ohio University. Thus, apology ads can reinforce negative perceptions and raise awareness of them among people who've never tried, or even heard of, the product. But Benoit, the author of 'Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies,' a book about how corporations and individuals restore their reputations, generally applauds the Domino's approach. 'People do not like to admit they're wrong, but they do like to hear other people admit it,' he says. 'When someone does fess up, people tend to respect you for having the courage to admit it.' Plus, he says, 'once you've said, `Our pizza tastes like cardboard,' you've got people's attention. Most people will ignore you if you just said, `We're new and improved.' Every (advertiser) says that. This gets people to sit up and take notice.' Another potential problem: credibility. Hasn't Domino's been saying for years how great its pizza is? And isn't it now insulting all the customers who thought its product was just fine the way it was? 'It's a very dangerous game,' says Claudia Caplan, a veteran advertising executive. 'Two bad things can happen: You drive away the people who liked the old pizza better, and you don't really make the new pizza better, which makes your (new) customers say, `You lied to me.' Domino's has to make damn sure they're not making it 5 percent better. It better be 50 percent better.' Caplan's former ad agency, Mendelsohn Zien of Los Angeles, created a campaign for Hardee's in 2004 that explored territory similar to Domino's. The Hardee's spots featured young actors who spoke directly into the camera to attest to the general lousiness of Hardee's hamburgers. 'My experience with Hardee's as far as burgers go? Uh uh, not so great,' said one. '... Maybe it's hard to make a great burger if you're also trying to make fried chicken, ham-and-cheese sandwiches and hotdogs. I mean, I wouldn't go to a dentist who claimed to be a brain surgeon or a plumber. So why would you let Hardee's make your burger?' The ads went on to note that Hardee's was paring its menu offerings, and using higher-quality beef in its burgers. The result? Customer-satisfaction scores have improved substantially since the ads aired, Caplan says. A frank admission of failure may work for a burger chain, but it may not be the ticket for a politician fighting to stay in office. During his 2008 campaign for reelection, Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Fla. went on the air to apologize to voters for a trip to Scotland he took with disgraced former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. 'I embarrassed myself and embarrassed you, and for that I am very sorry,' Feeney said in the commercial. 'I approved this message because public service is about being honest even when you make a mistake.' The confession may have been good for Feeney's soul, but it didn't do much for his poll numbers. It may even have compounded his problems by reminding voters of his questionable judgment and bad behavior. He lost his bid for re-election. "
1,"Scientists reported Thursday they had developed a technique that can quickly create safe alternatives to human embryonic stem cells, a major advance toward developing a less controversial approach for treating for a host of medical problems. The researchers published a series of experiments showing they can use laboratory-made versions of naturally occurring biological signals to quickly convert ordinary skin cells into cells that appear virtually identical to embryonic stem cells. Moreover, the same strategy can then coax those cells to morph into specific tissues that would be a perfect match for transplantation into patients. The work, by a team led by Derrick Rossi of the Children's Hospital Boston, was praised by other researchers as a breakthrough. 'This paper is a major paper, in my view, in the field of regenerative medicine,' said Douglas Melton, who co-directs the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Opponents of human embryonic stem cell research, meanwhile, seized on the advance as the most convincing evidence yet that alternatives were sufficient, rendering the morally questionable cells unnecessary. Rossi and other researchers, however, said that embryonic stem cell research was still crucial because, among other things, embryonic stem cells are irreplaceable for validating alternatives. Nevertheless, the announcement, described in a paper published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, could mark a pivotal moment in the long, contentious history of embryonic stem cell research. The advance comes as the future of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research hangs in doubt. A federal judge stunned the field Aug. 23 by ruling that the Obama administration's new more permissive policy for funding the research violated a federal law barring taxpayer dollars from being used for studies that involve destroying human embryos. The National Institutes of Health said that it supports research only on cells that have been obtained by privately funded scientists. An appeals court Tuesday let the NIH continue the funding as the case winds through the legal system. Scientists hope embryonic stem cells will lead to cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and a host of other ailments because they can turn into almost any tissue in the body. But they can be obtained only by destroying days-old embryos, which some consider equivalent to killing human life. In 2006, researchers discovered that they could coax adult cells into a state that appeared identical to embryonic stem cells, dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), by activating four genes. Those cells could morph into various tissues in the same way that embryonic stem cells can. But the process involved inserting genes into cells using retroviruses, which raised the risk the cells could cause cancer. Since then, scientists have been racing to develop alternative methods. Several approaches, using chemicals or other types of viruses, have shown promise. But none has completely eliminated the safety concerns, and most have been slow and inefficient. The new approach involves molecules known as 'messenger RNA,' or mRNA, which the DNA inside cells use to create proteins they need carry out various vital functions. The researchers created mRNA molecules carrying the instructions for the cell's machinery to produce the four key proteins needed to reprogram themselves into iPS cells. After tinkering with the mRNA molecules in the laboratory to make signals that the cells would not destroy as dangerous invaders, the researchers found that a daily cocktail of their creations were surprisingly fast and efficient at reprogramming the cells. The approach converted the cells in about half the time of previous methods - only about 17 days - with surprising economy - up to 100 times more efficient than the standard approach. Moreover, detailed tests indicated the cells had not experienced any disturbing changes in their DNA caused by previous methods and were virtually identical to embryonic stem cells. In addition, the researchers went one step further and showed that they could use the approach to then coax the iPS cells they created into a specific type of cell, in this case muscle cells. t "
1,"It's not easy being Canadian. Especially when you live in America. Especially when, after three blizzards, you're the only one in Washington who still likes snow. Or when your country finally wins an Olympic gold medal on home soil, and friends pat you on the back like you just took off your training wheels. Here, you are a stranger in an alternate universe. You get mail on Saturday, celebrate Thanksgiving in November instead of October. Your occasional accent takes little effort to hide. Your assimilation can be quick. So do you stay true to your roots, desperately hanging on to the few quirks that set you apart? Or does that very effort betray the quintessential Canadian instinct to not make waves? From birth, Canadians are bred to be courteous, congenial, compliant. And when your country is defined by this self-effacing nature, it seems impossible to stand out without giving up your essence. In a strange way, the perfect Canadian has come to be one who does not exist. This is the Canadian paradox. So much so that on the day before the Olympics began in Vancouver, Prime Minister Stephen Harper felt the need to give his compatriots a little pep talk. 'Patriotism as Canadians should not make us feel the least bit shy or embarrassed,' Harper said. 'We will ask the world to forgive us this time this uncharacteristic outburst of patriotism and pride _ our pride of being part of a country that is strong, confident and stands tall among the nations.' Some of us south of the border have already given in to such outbursts. Maybe it has something to do with the air and ethos of the United States, a place where standing out is often the only thing that matters. More likely, it has to do with the sudden rush of patriotism that comes with being an expatriate. Like many Canadian expats, I didn't become fiercely proud and defensive until I moved to America 16 years ago. Many of us have taken to displaying our maple leaf more prominently than we might have back home. After all, it's one of the only marks distinguishing us from our neighbo(u)rs, along with more proper spelling. My husband and I have even adopted a little stuffed, maple-leaf- bearing, red-hoodie-wearing moose as our mascot, bringing him with us on all our travels (he provided much amusement to a Berber guide in the Sahara). And I've found myself clinging to every bit of Canadian trivia I can wrangle up, as though my identity becomes clearer with each factoid I accumulate. I once spent a good chunk of a dinner conversation proving to someone that basketball was invented by a Canadian. (Ontario-born James Naismith is the father of the sport, though, admittedly, he invented it in Springfield, Mass. And yes, these assertions are often followed by such concessions.) As the kind of quiet, awkward, bookish type who can't sit through any sort of sporting event, I nevertheless find myself camped out in front of the TV every four years (there's really only one Olympic Games in Canada, as winter is our only season), just to see how our country fares. I swear my blood pressure shot up during Canada's epic hockey rematch with Switzerland _ who beat us in Torino _ on Thursday night and subsided only after Sidney Crosby's clutch goal assured our team's survival. I've gotten so into the patriotism that on visits back home to Toronto, I've been surprised to hear fellow Canadians disparaging our homeland. They tell me they're pretty indifferent to Canada, that 'the States,' as it is called up there, is kind of cooler and that Americans _ with their revolutionary past _ have more to be proud of in many ways. Canadians aren't patriotic, my compatriots tell me, Americans are. All this, of course, is appalling to an expat. It's amid this existential crisis that I, and other Canadians, are experiencing this Olympic season. The dilemma remains: If being noticed is contrary to your nature and values, how then do you excel? The official response of the Canadian government has been to embrace unabashed patriotism at these Games. The country has been circulating its new motto _ Own the Podium _ with the ubiquity of a Nike ad. This slogan is the official name of a five-year, $110 million-dollar initiative that was secretly orchestrated by sports federations, corporations and scientists until Canadian news magazine Macleans unveiled the details last month. The covert program has aimed to provide Canadian athletes with the very best sports technology, medicine and training _ all with the goal of winning the most medals in Vancouver and placing in the top three in the gold medal count at the Paralympic Winter Games. Maybe I've been away from home too long, but that Canadians want to win sounds, well, suspiciously American. In a country that's long been taunted for its 'shooting for bronze' mentality, such earnest, even aggressive, aspirations have made more than a few uneasy. This month, the national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, ran an article titled 'Chill, Canada. Let's not go Soviet over the Olympics.' The author, John Doyle, wrote: 'It would be a tremendous relief if somebody talked about just enjoying the Games, doing their best and having fun. ... Our superiority is meaningless in the great scheme of things.' We've seen this backlash against craving victory before. At the 2006 Olympics in Torino, when the Canadian women's hockey team mopped the ice with host Italy 16-0, Canadian hockey icon Don Cherry criticized them on national television for running up the score. 'It's not the Canadian way,' he said. (Last Saturday in Vancouver, the team faced similar comments after it beat Slovakia 18-0.) There have also been some decidedly un-Canadian skirmishes leading up to these Games, after Canadian officials sought to incubate a certain home-court advantage by limiting the extent to which other countries' athletes could practice on our turf. Though that is common practice for Olympic hosts, many foreign athletes have claimed that Canada went too far. Some have even blamed the Georgian luger's death during a training run in part on this restriction. Through it all, Canadian leaders have insisted that it's possible to win and still be nice. But I must confess that I've watched the Games with some ambivalence, wondering if each medal Canada wins represents another small shift in the nation's values. Part of what makes me love Canada is its regard for dignity over achievement. And whether we just can't have both, I don't know. In the meantime, my maple leaf wind chime hangs in my Capitol Hill apartment, leaving no question which team this household is cheering for.

1,"Doctoral programs across the nation took a collective pause Tuesday to peruse a long-awaited report that offers the first definitive rankings of the programs in 15 years. It might take a doctorate to fully comprehend the National Research Council rankings. Instead of ranking programs from first to last, the report states each ranking as a statistical range. So, we now know that the comparative literature program at the University of Maryland ranks somewhere between sixth and 19th among 46 like programs nationwide. And that's just one ranking. The report rates programs two different ways, adding to the confusion. Universities seized on their more flattering rankings as affirmations of their better programs. Doctoral departments rely on the highly regarded NRC rankings to attract students and faculty. 'I've said to undergraduates who want to go to graduate school in history that if you can't get into a top-10 program, don't go. That's how significant this is,' said Edward Ayers, a history scholar who is president of the University of Richmond. The rankings cover 5,000 doctoral programs in 62 fields at 212 institutions and is billed as the largest comparative analysis of its sort to date. The rankings are based on 2006 data, which makes them rather dated. Then again, the programs hadn't been ranked since 1995. Predictably, the top Ivy League schools and the premiere University of California campuses earn the highest rankings in many fields. Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore earns premiere rankings in history, astrophysics, linguistics, neurobiology and nursing, among other fields, meaning that Hopkins is listed among a handful of schools whose ranking could be as high as one, two or three. The University of Virginia ranks high in Spanish and Portuguese and pharmacology. Virginia Tech excels in forestry. Top-rated and ascendant programs will waste no time spreading the word, while low-rated offerings will fall under closer scrutiny, education leaders said. 'It is an affirmation if you're doing well, and it is reason to question if you're at the bottom,' said Arthur Garson, provost of U-Va. 'You don't ever want to sit on your laurels with a top program. . . . The bottom ones, you really do need to make an affirmative decision of three things to do: grow it, keep it the same or shrink it. You can't leave it alone.' Department heads may have a hard time synthesizing the rankings into a press release. They're more complicated than past rankings from the research council. Each program is ranked once according to characteristics such as faculty publications and how long it takes students to earn a degree. (The longest doctoral program in the nation is the music program at Washington University in St. Louis, with a median length of 16.3 years, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.) A second ranking derives from each program's reputation, as measured by the academic community. Jeremiah Ostriker, chairman of the project, told the Chronicle the raters rejected simple best-to-worst rankings because they offered 'spurious precision.' He said of the resulting jumble of numbers, 'It's a little unsatisfactory, but at least it's honest.' "
1,"The ground rules at a Gallaudet University speed-dating night were simple: Five minutes with each partner. When the time is up, everyone switches seats. Keep the conversations G-rated. And no talking allowed. The last rule was the easiest to follow, since Gallaudet is one of the few colleges in the world where American Sign Language dominates all nonwritten communication. 'Sooo . . .' signed organizer Aneesah Silvels, a graduate student, who used exaggerated arm movements for emphasis. 'It is time to start.' With a flurry of hand movements, about two dozen speed daters started to get to know one another on a recent Friday night in the campus student center. The questions would have been familiar to anyone who has been on a first date: Where are you from? What are you studying? What do you do for fun? But instead of a quiet, intimate conversation, it was easy for anyone who knows sign language to eavesdrop. Organizers had to keep shooing away spectators. That constant shortage of conversational privacy makes dating on the campus difficult - especially in such a small, tight-knit college community, which has about 2,000 undergraduates and 500 grad students. 'At a large university, you could have a one-night stand, and no one would know,' signed Emmanuel Felix, a sophomore from San Diego who is studying accounting. 'Here at Gallaudet, if you have a one-night stand, everyone knows.' Speed dating, in which singles can gather to spend a few minutes with several potential dates at one time, has gained popularity in the past decade, though the title character of the show 'Frasier' once deemed it 'all the stress and humiliation of a blind date, times 12.' The event was part of a class project for Silvels, who is studying deaf education. Each student in one of her graduate courses had to come up with a project that would explain Gallaudet to the Washington community or bring together different groups on campus. 'I have friends who have done speed dating and really liked it,' Silvels said. 'I thought this would be really fun because it's very adult-like.' She posted fliers around campus and promoted the event on Facebook, telling students to 'Be there or be single!' Felix and his friends were complaining about the campus dating scene when they saw a flier. 'We just started cracking up,' he said. 'But we decided, let's be positive.' The event began with many more women than men. The introductory bio swap usually included a quintessential Gallaudet question: Did you go to a traditional, mainstream high school or an all-deaf one? For students who have grown up in strong deaf communities, sign language is the native tongue and often a defining part of who they are. Students who attended traditional schools were usually one of just a few deaf kids, separated socially and academically from most of their classmates and pushed to learn to read lips. Technology also has changed the definition of deafness, as cochlear implants and hearing aids have allowed more people to increase their ability to hear. One student decided not to attend the event because he wouldn't be allowed to speak as he signed, a touchy topic on a campus where most select one or the other, Silvels said. One woman who attended Gallaudet's secondary school was paired with a man who attended a mainstream Florida high school. He marveled at how 'completely different' it was at Gallaudet and how he is more social because he can easily communicate with everyone. The university also has a growing number of hearing students, such as Silvels, who don't fit into either social group. 'Gallaudet is the world they always wanted. The teachers sign, all of the workers sign. Gallaudet is their heaven. . . . They don't want to destroy that culture,' said Silvels. 'I feel like I always have to have my guard up. I have to have thick skin.' At a break halfway through the event, many women, having scoped out their options, disappeared. 'It was a great way to meet new people,' Justyna Grela signed earnestly. 'We just have somewhere else to go.' Suddenly, there were more men than women. For the last round of dates, Felix didn't get paired up with anyone. He sat alone as his friends chatted with new partners 'I'm not really looking for a relationship. I'm not really boyfriend or husband material,' he signed. 'And, hey, I don't mind being a wingman.' "
1,"Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved the use of a special security law ahead of a rally to mark the third anniversary of a coup that ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Saturday's anti-government protest in Bangkok is expected to be the largest since demonstrations outside Government House in April turned into riots that left two dead and more than 120 injured. Invoking the Internal Security Act allows the country's internal security and counterinsurgency agency headed by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to order curfews and restrict freedom of movement in situations deemed harmful to national security. 'We want to make sure we have the means to resolve the matter quickly if necessary,' said government spokesman Supachai Jaisamuth, who said the Cabinet approved the use of the act for five days, starting Friday. The law will cover the Dusit district of the capital where several traditional protest venues are located, including Parliament and the prime minister's office. The protesters plan to rally Saturday at nearby Royal Plaza, about half a mile (1 kilometer) from the home of the king's top adviser, whom protesters accuse of orchestrating the Sept. 19, 2006, coup that toppled Thaksin. 'We will gather at the square, and we believe the crowd size will be large enough that it will spill over to his house,' said protest leader Jatuporn Phromphan. 'Our leader was toppled by force. It has been three years and we want them to know what the people want.' Protest leaders have called off rallies in recent weeks after the government invoked the act, but vowed to go ahead with Saturday's demonstration. The act was also invoked during a regional security forum in July amid fear of protests. Even three years after his ouster, Thaksin remains at the center of Thailand's protracted political crisis. He was accused of corruption and abuse of power during his time in office, and was sentenced in absentia last year to two years in prison on violation of a conflict of interest law. However, the fugitive former leader remains popular among the urban and rural poor. Elections after his ouster brought his allies back to power, setting off months of protests that eventually shut down the capital's airports for a week. Court decisions then disqualified a pro-Thaksin prime minister for electoral fraud, and Abhisit formed the current coalition government. This weekend's protesters want Abhisit to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. The protest comes a day before Abhisit is due to leave for New York for the United Nations General Assembly. The protesters have also called for the resignation of Prem Tinsulanonda, an 88-year-old adviser to Thailand's revered king, and accuse the country's elite -- the military, judiciary and other unelected officials -- of undermining democracy by interfering in politics. The protesters have vowed they will disperse peacefully by midnight, but the government said invoking the security law was necessary amid fears the gathering could plunge Thailand back into turmoil.

1,"Nothing defines a garden space better than a fence, and a simple enclosure will give a vegetable garden the presence it deserves. A modest fence will keep dogs in and rabbits out (though little else) and offer a support for climbing vegetables and flowering vines. If deer are a problem, the fence will have to be six to eight feet high. Chain link is cheap but so difficult to make attractive. Low wooden fences, typically up to four feet high, provide charm and utility without overpowering a space. Choices include solid fencing, with vertical or horizontal boards; or the more open style of post and rail fence. The classic picket fence is perfect for a vegetable garden, but be aware that a white picket fence is conspicuous and considered a bit of a cliche by some designers. Pickets can be painted more subdued colors or left unpainted to allow the wooden pales of cedar, locust or exotic ipe to age to a silver gray. The unpainted cedar picket fence is my favorite, beautiful without calling attention to itself. Panels of woven willow stems, called wattle fencing, will provide a rustic, Colonial look, but they don't last too long in our climate. Snow fencing has an honest look, though it is inherently flimsy, only as straight as its posts, and may need resetting annually. Garden gates provide their own opportunity for charm and whimsy, and can incorporate an arch for a vining plant. Before putting up a fence, establish a perimeter bed that will extend 24 inches out from the fence line. This will provide a place to grow herbs and flowers that will soften the fence and attract pollinators and birds to the garden. "
1,"The Greek government will announce as much as $6.5 billion of additional deficit cuts Wednesday, bowing to pressure from the European Union and investors to do more to tame the region's biggest shortfall, a person familiar with the plan said. The new measures will include higher tobacco, alcohol and sales taxes and deeper cuts in public workers' bonus payments, said the person, who declined to be identified because the details aren't public. EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Monday that Greece must reveal new measures 'in the coming days' to allay officials' concerns that the current austerity plan falls short. The announcement would come two days before Prime Minister George Papandreou meets Germany's Angela Merkel and may help the chancellor justify aiding Greece to taxpayers and political opponents who say the country shouldn't be bailed out after living beyond its means. Papandreou said in a speech Tuesday to his Pasok party in Athens that the new measures will be 'painful' and that civil servants, who have already seen their wages frozen and benefits cut, 'will have to get by on less.' The main union for public works plans its third general strike of the year on March 16. Concern about Greece's ability to finance its debt pushed that premium to 396 basis points on Jan. 28, the highest since the start of the euro in 1999, making it more expensive for the country to sell new bonds. 'If our country doesn't manage to borrow with similar terms as is normal for a European Union country then the consequences will be something more than catastrophic,' Papandreou said. 'Our responsibility is to avoid this catastrophe.' Papandreou acknowledged that raising taxes might hurt economic growth, though the 'primary threat is not the recession, but something worse, finding ourselves unable to borrow,' he said. German lawmakers say euro-area officials are devising a plan to grant Greece about $34 billion in aid should the need arise. One option could involve using German state-owned lenders such as the KfW Group to buy its bonds. That would be enough to cover more than 20 billion euros of debt redemptions in April and May. Greece had planned to sell $6.7 billion in bonds as soon as this week. Greece is under no pressure to sell more debt and will do so when market conditions are 'favorable,' Petros Christodoulou, head of the country's debt management agency, said in an interview Tuesday. In its original deficit reduction plan presented to the European Commission on Jan. 15, the government pledged to cut a deficit of 12.7 percent of gross domestic product to 8.7 percent this year. The new measures, the second set of additional actions announced by Greece since the original plan was presented, are the equivalent of as much as 2 percent of GDP and aim to insure that Greece meets the deficit-reduction goal. "
1,"A French drug company is hoping to offer American women something their European counterparts already have: a pill that works long after 'the morning after.' The drug, dubbed ella, would be sold as a contraceptive _ one that could prevent pregnancy for as many as five days following unprotected sex. But the new drug is a close chemical relative of the abortion pill RU-486, raising the possibility that it could theoretically be used to induce abortion by making the womb inhospitable for an embryo. The controversy sparked by that ambiguity will force a panel of federal advisers scheduled to consider endorsing the drug next week to grapple with a host of thorny issues. The last time the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vetted an emergency contraceptive _ Plan B, the so-called morning-after pill _ the decision was mired in debate over such fundamental questions as when life begins and the distinction between preventing and terminating a pregnancy. Ella is raising many of those same politically charged questions _ but more sharply, testing the Obama administration's pledge to keep ideology from influencing scientific decisions. Plan B, which works for up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, was eventually approved for sale without a prescription, though a doctor's order is required for girls younger than 17. The new drug promises to extend that period to at least 120 hours. Approved in Europe last year, ella is now available as an emergency contraceptive in at least 22 countries. Ella is being welcomed by many U.S. advocates for family planning and reproductive rights. Opponents of the new drug, however, argue that the French company and the FDA would be misleading the public by labeling ella as an emergency contraceptive. Its chemical similarity to RU-486 makes it more like the controversial abortion pill, which can terminate a pregnancy at up to nine weeks, they say. RU-486 has soared in popularity since approval 10 years ago in the United States, raising the possibility that ella _ or ulipristal acetate _ might become ubiquitous in American women's medicine cabinets. 'With ulipristal, women will be enticed to buy a poorly tested abortion drug, unaware of its medical risks, under the guise that it's a morning-after pill,' said Wendy Wright, of Concerned Women for America, which led the battle against Plan B. Plan B prevents a pregnancy by administering high doses of a hormone that mimics progesterone. It works primarily by inhibiting the ovaries from producing eggs. Critics argue it can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb, which some consider equivalent to an abortion, making it a continuing focus of controversy. RU-486 works by blocking progesterone's activity. Because progesterone is needed to prepare the womb to accept a fertilized egg and to nurture a developing embryo, RU-486 can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting and dislodge growing embryos. Its chemical similarity raises the possibility that ella _ perhaps if taken at elevated doses _ may do the same thing, though no one knows for sure because the drug has never been tested that way. Opponents of the drug are convinced it will. 'It kills embryos, just like the abortion pill,' said Donna Harrison, president of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 'It's embryotoxic.' Critics fear that women who do not realize they are already pregnant will use the drug, unwittingly giving themselves an abortion. 'Women have a right to know this drug is destroying a life growing in their womb,' said Jeanne Monahan, director of the Family Research Council's Center for Human Dignity. 'The difference between preventing life and destroying life is hugely significant to many women. Women deserve to know that difference.' They also fear some women will purposefully try to use ella to abort a fetus, putting themselves at risk for potentially life-threatening complications that have been reported among a small number of women using RU-486 and possibly damage their developing child if it doesn't work. 'This not good for women's health or for their babies,' Monahan said. But proponents dismiss those concerns, saying ella has been tested only within five days of unprotected sex and there is no evidence that it works as anything other than a contraceptive. Ella appears to be about twice as effective as Plan B at preventing pregnancy, and its effectiveness does remains constant for at least 120 hours. Plan B, in contrast, begins to lose its effectiveness almost immediately and becomes ineffective after 72 hours. 'There is an great unmet need out there for emergency contraception that is effective as this for so long,' said Erin Gainer, chief executive of HRA Pharma of Paris. Studies involving more than 4,500 women in the United States and Europe show the ella is highly safe, producing only headaches, nausea, fatigue and other minor side effects, she said. The company has no plans to test ella as an abortion drug, but it did not appear to cause any problems for the handful of women who have become pregnant after taking the drug, she said. 'We're very clear on the fact that this is indeed a contraceptive _ a method of prevention of pregnancy,' Gainer said. But based on the FDA's repeated delays in approving the sale of Plan B without a prescription, Gainer and others said they feared the accusations might influence the agency. 'FDA should be a `Just the facts ma'am' organization,' said Susan F. Wood, an associate professor of the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services who resigned from the FDA to protest delays making Plan B more accessible. 'I'm hoping the FDA will take that position.' 'The people who are opposing this are not just opposed to abortion,' said Amy Allina, program director at the National Women's Health Network. 'They also opposed contraception and they are trying to confuse the issue.' If ella wins approval, it will likely inflame a long-running debate: whether doctors have an obligation to write prescriptions for medication they oppose on moral or religious grounds and whether pharmacists have an obligation to fill them. Many doctors and pharmacists already refuse to write or fill prescriptions for Plan B or refer patients elsewhere for it. 'Pharmacists will have more obvious reasons to refuse to dispense this drug, and to refuse to refer,' said Karen Brauer, president of the Pharmacists for Life International. 'My suspicion is that more pharmacists will wish to opt out of dispensing ulipristal than any other of the previous drugs.' "
1,"A U.N. food agency is calling for money to buy seeds, tools and fertilizer to help earthquake-devastated Haiti through its spring planting season. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization on Saturday called for $23 million to support farming in fields and backyards and repair infrastructure like irrigation canals. It says home gardens and backyard raising of pigs and chickens will help morale and boost nutrition. Even before this week's quake, many Haitians were undernourished, and two years ago, high food and fuel prices triggered violent protests in the impoverished country. The next planting season begins in March, so the U.N. agency is pressing international donors to ensure part of the money in the United Nations' appeal is earmarked for agriculture. "
1,"EDITOR'S NOTE: Iranian authorities have barred journalists for international news organizations from reporting on the streets and ordered them to stay in their offices. This report is based on the accounts of witnesses reached in Iran and official statements carried on Iranian media. By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer EDITOR'S NOTE: Iranian authorities have barred journalists for international news organizations from reporting on the streets and ordered them to stay in their offices. This report is based on the accounts of witnesses reached in Iran and official statements carried on Iranian media. ------ A senior Iranian cleric demanded in a nationally broadcast sermon Friday that leaders of election protests be punished harshly, with some 'worthy of execution.' The country's increasingly isolated opposition leader effectively ended his role in the demonstrations, saying he'll seek permits for future rallies. Iran's ruling clergy has widened its crackdown on the opposition since the bitterly disputed June 12 presidential election, and scattered protests have replaced the initial mass gatherings. The official Web site of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, his main tool of communicating with his supporters, was hacked Friday, leaving it blank, an aide said. Mousavi has said victory was stolen from him through fraud, challenging the proclamation of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner. Mousavi has sent mixed signals to his supporters in recent days, asking them not to break the law, while pledging not to drop his challenge of the election. Hundreds have been detained since the vote, including journalists, academics and university students, and a special court has been set up to put them on trial. At least 17 people have been killed in the protests, in addition to eight members of the pro-government Basij militia, the government has said. President Barack Obama, joined at the White House by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hailed the demonstrators in Iran and condemned the violence against them. 'Their bravery in the face of brutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice,' Obama said. 'The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. In spite of the government's efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence, we see it and we condemn it.' Obama scoffed at accusations Thursday of U.S. meddling in Iran by Ahmadinejad, who called for 'repentance' by the U.S. leader. Obama added that Mousavi has 'captured the imagination or spirit' of those inside Iran who are 'interested in opening up.' In a Friday sermon at Tehran University, a senior cleric, Ayatollah Ahmed Khatami, called for harsh retribution for dissent. 'Anybody who fights against the Islamic system or the leader of Islamic society, fight him until complete destruction,' he said in the nationally broadcast speech. The cleric alleged that some involved in the unrest had used firearms. 'Anyone who takes up arms to fight with the people, they are worthy of execution,' he said. 'We ask that the judiciary confront the leaders of the protests, leaders of the violations, and those who are supported by the United States and Israel strongly, and without mercy to provide a lesson for all.' Khatami said those who disturbed the peace and destroyed public property were 'at war with God,' and said they should be 'dealt with without mercy.' He reminded worshippers that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rules by God's design and must not be defied. The cleric also lashed out at foreign journalists, accusing them of false reporting, and singled out Britain for new criticism. 'In this unrest, Britons have behaved very mischievously and it is fair to add the slogan of 'down with England' to slogan of 'down with USA,'' he said, interrupted by worshippers' chants of 'Death to Israel.' Earlier this week, Iran expelled two British diplomats, prompting the expulsion of two Iranian diplomats by Britain. In Trieste, Italy, foreign ministers of the Group of Eight countries called for an end to the violence in Iran and urged the authorities to find a peaceful solution. Also Friday, more than 150 demonstrators attacked the Iranian Embassy outside the Swedish capital of Stockholm, throwing stones, breaking windows and injuring one worker, police said. Officers evicted the few demonstrators who climbed in through broken windows and arrested one person, said police spokesman Ulf Hoglund. Khatami, meanwhile, alleged that the icon of the opposition, slain protester Neda Agha Soltan, was killed by demonstrators, not the Iranian security forces. Soltan, 27, was killed by a shot to the chest last week, on the sidelines of a protest. 'The proof and evidence shows that they (protesters) have done it themselves and have raised propaganda against the system,' he said. 'I say hereby that these deceitful media have to know that the ordeal will be over and shame will remain for them.' In London, an Iranian doctor who said he tried to save Soltan as she bled to death, told the BBC she apparently was shot by a member of the Basij militia. Protesters spotted an armed member of the militia on a motorcycle, and stopped and disarmed him, said Dr. Arash Hejazi. The man appeared to admit shooting Soltan, shouting 'I didn't want to kill her,' but the furious protesters confiscated his identity card and took photographs of him before letting him go, Hejazi said. In quelling protests, Basij militiamen have broken up even small groups of people walking together to prevent any possible gathering. Still, dozens of friends and relatives of Soltan managed to pay tribute Friday, arriving at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in groups of two and three, uttering brief prayers and placing flowers on her grave, witnesses said. Vigils for Soltan have been held around the world. Mousavi, who has said he is being increasingly isolated, lost his main link to the world after his official Web site, Kalemeh, came up blank and stripped of any text or pictures. Mousavi's associate Ali Reza Beheshti told The Associated Press the site had been taken down by unknown hackers. In a message on the site late Thursday, Mousavi had said he would seek permission for future protests, even though he said unfair restrictions were being imposed. He said he has been asked by the Interior Ministry to apply in person, a week in advance. The opposition leader noted that Ahmadinejad has been able to hold two postelection marches and a Tehran rally 'that were well-publicized on state television, seeming to encourage participation with their regularly advertised march routes.' Mousavi has said the authorities are pressuring him to withdraw his challenge by trying to isolate and discredit him. He hasn't led a rally in more than a week. Khamenei has ordered a large security detail around Mousavi -- ostensibly to protect him, but presumably also to restrict his movements. Authorities have also targeted those close to Mousavi. Late Thursday, state TV reported that the head of Mousavi's information committee, Abolfazl Fateh, was banned from leaving for Britain. The report, which could not be verified independently, identified Fateh as a doctoral student in Britain. The semiofficial Fars news agency said Fateh was banned from travel so authorities could investigate 'some of the recent gatherings,' a reference to election protests. At least 11 Mousavi campaign workers and 25 staffers on his newspaper have been detained. On Wednesday, 70 university professors were detained after meeting with Mousavi. All but four have been released. Those still in custody included his former campaign manager. ---------- Laub reported from Cairo; Associated Press writers Shaya Tayefe Mohajer in Cairo, Louise Nordstrom in Stockholm, and Ben Feller in Washington contributed to this report.

1,"The 16 nations that use the euro are urging China to let the value of its currency rise to help stimulate global economic growth. Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, the head of the 16 EU nations that use the euro, wants to see a 'broad-based appreciation' of the Chinese yuan against the dollar and other major currencies. He said he expressed the view at a meeting Tuesday with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. Also at the meeting were EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. Juncker told reporters China's 'effective exchange rate remains undervalued.' He says the EU wants China to stoke more domestic demand and added the euro-yuan exchange rate is not 'what we would have hoped.' "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post: There are things to dislike in the tax deal reached between President Obama and congressional Republicans, and reasons to be nervous about it. But there are more reasons to support it, which is what we urge lawmakers to do. On the negative side is the agreement to extend the tax cuts for households making more than $250,000 per year. This is an unwise use of scarce resources. The argument that allowing the top rates to rise would harm small-business job creation has scant basis in reality. As a matter of economic stimulus, relatively few of those dollars would trickle back into the economy. Even worse is the capitulation on the estate tax; for the next two years, the first $5 million of an individual estate, and the first $10 million of a couple's estate, would be exempt from taxation, and the remainder would be taxed at 35 percent. This is a more generous deal for the wealthy than what the administration had put on the table, which was to restore the 2009 exemptions of $3.5 million per individual and $7 million per couple while taxing the rest of an estate at 45 percent. These changes are unnecessary and expensive and increase the risk of making bad policies permanent. Why then support the deal? Because in the short term, allowing the bulk of the tax cuts to expire would threaten an already fragile recovery - and because balancing the noxious aspects of the agreement are smart policies that offer a real hope of stimulating the economy and helping those who badly need the help. The White House secured the renewal of various refundable tax credits - translation: government checks to those who don't earn enough to owe income taxes - along with a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits. These will provide a significant boost to the most vulnerable and hardest hit by the recession. Second, the deal adds a temporary, 2 percent payroll tax holiday that will put money back in workers' pockets - and, presumably, into the economy. House Democrats are feeling bruised, but these deals represent significant concessions extracted by the White House from Republicans. They are likely to prove effective, efficient ways to spur the economy, as should the measure to encourage capital investment by businesses. So the compromise is justified - but only if this moment represents a pivot to the harder work of long-term deficit reduction, as Mr. Obama suggested it will. It's encouraging that leaders could come up with 'a solution, even if it's not 100 percent of what I want or what the Republicans want,' as the president said in Winston-Salem, N.C., Monday. However, this only proves once again that Washington is capable of compromise when it involves spending more and taxing less - in total, adding a staggering $850 billion to the national debt. Filling that hole, and the much deeper one already facing the nation, will be a more difficult and even more urgent task than this week's compromise, and the work on it must begin with the new year. "
1,"Honored for peace in a time of war, President Barack Obama is formally becoming a Nobel laureate on Thursday under such odd circumstances that even he will make a point of it. In a ceremony in Oslo, the president will receive his Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma for his work to reshape the way the United States deals with the world. Yet he does so under the long shadow of the war in Afghanistan, where he is ordering 30,000 more troops into battle. Obama's Nobel speech -- a tradition that goes to the winner and is billed as a lecture for the world -- will explore his thinking about war, security and the pursuit of peace. He is likely to spell out the role of American leadership and the responsibilities of all nations. There will be plenty of splashy ceremony in Obama's honor, too. His first stop was the Norwegian Nobel Institute, where the Nobel committee meets to decide who wins the prestigious prize. All committee members will be there to greet their latest recipient as he signs the Nobel guest book. He also will meet with Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. In the evening, Obama is expected to wave to a torchlight procession from his hotel balcony and stroll with Norwegian royalty to a dinner banquet. He will offer comments a second time there and cap his brisk jaunt to Europe covering not even two days, even with travel time. The president and his wife, Michelle, arrived to a chilly, damp Oslo morning after an overnight flight from Washington. He and the first lady came off Air Force One holding hands and smiling, greeted by a small clutch of dignitaries. Obama was due back in Washington by early Friday afternoon. The Nobel committee announced Obama had won the peace prize when he wasn't even nine months on the job, recognizing his aspirations much more than his achievements. The panel cited his call for a world free of nuclear weapons, for a more engaged U.S. role in combating global warming, for his support of the United Nations and multilateral diplomacy and for broadly capturing the attention of the world and giving its people 'hope.' It was such a surprise, and derided so loudly by some critics as premature, that the Nobel committee took the unusual step of defending itself. Obama reacted with humility, saying he was undeserving. Obama's quick trip reflects a White House that sees little value in trumpeting an honor for peace just nine days after Obama announced he was sending more troops off to war. Asked if Obama was excited about the award, national security aide and speechwriter Ben Rhodes responded, 'I think he feels as if it places a responsibility upon him.' 'It's the company that you keep as a Nobel laureate that I think makes the deepest impression upon him,' said Rhodes, who was helping craft the president's speech. 'That kind of adds an extra obligation to essentially extend the legacy.' Obama was considering lots of ideas for the speech and was expected to winnow them and hash out a final draft aboard Air Force One on the flight to Norway, where the peace-award-in-wartime irony hasn't gone unnoticed. Peace activists in the Norwegian capital plan a 5,000-person anti-war protest on Thursday. Protesters have plastered posters around Oslo featuring the image of Obama from his iconic campaign poster, altered with skepticism to say, 'Change?' Demonstrators plan to gather in sight of Obama's hotel room balcony, and chant slogans playing on Obama's own slogans, foremost among them: 'Change: Stop the War in Afghanistan.' The list of Nobel peace laureates over the last 100 years includes transformative figures and giants on the world stage. They include heroes of the president, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, and others he has long admired, such as George Marshall, who launched a postwar recovery plan for Europe. The Nobel honor comes with a $1.4 million prize. The White House says Obama will give that to charities but has not yet decided which ones. ------ Associated Press writer Ian MacDougall in Oslo contributed to this report. "
1,"The European Space Agency has taken the closest look yet at asteroid Lutetia in an extraordinary quest some 280 million miles in outer space between Mars and Jupiter. The comet-chaser Rosetta transmitted its first pictures from the largest asteroid ever visited by a satellite Saturday night after it flew by Lutetia as close as 1,900 miles (3,200 kilometers), ESA said in Darmstadt, Germany. 'These are fantastic and exciting pictures,' space agency scientist Rita Schulz said in a webcast presentation. She said it would take several weeks before all 400 pictures and all data from the high-precision instruments aboard Rosetta would come through to Earth. 'I am a very happy man,' said ESA manager David Southwood. 'It is a great day for European Science and for world science.' Though Lutetia was discovered some 150 years ago, for a long time it was little more than a point of light to those on Earth. Only recent high-resolution ground-based imaging has given a vague view of the asteroid, the agency said. 'At the moment we know very little about it,' Schulz said. Lutetia is believed to be 83.3 miles (134 kilometers) in diameter with a 'pronounced elongation,' but scientists have been puzzled as to what type of asteroid it is -- a 'primitive' one containing carbon compounds or a metallic asteroid. 'We are now going to get the details of this asteroid, which is very important,' Schulz said. 'There will be a lot of science coming from that mission.' Scientists hope to find in the information and images gathered by Rosetta clues to the history of comets and asteroids and of the solar system, Schulz said. For Rosetta, examining Lutetia and other asteroids is only a side event on its long journey to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- the mission's destination, said project manager Gerhard Schwehm. Rosetta was launched in 2004 and is expected to reach its target in 2014. Though the wait is long, scientists are certain it is going to be worthwhile, Schwehm said. 'We want to study the material out of which the planets formed,' he said. This is possible only close up, he said. "
1,"The governor of a southern Afghanistan district that has become a key focus of U.S. military efforts to root out the Taliban was killed Tuesday in a bombing, Afghan and U.S. officials said. Also Tuesday, four NATO troops were killed in eastern and southern Afghanistan, raising the toll of one of the deadliest months for U.S.-led international forces in the nearly nine-year war. Abdul Jabar, chief of Arghandab district in the southern province of Kandahar, was returning home from work at 4:30 p.m. with his 17-year-old son and two bodyguards when a car bomb detonated next to his car, Arghandab Police Chief Zamaray Khan said. The son and one of bodyguard were also killed. 'The district chief was a very honest man,' Khan said. 'He had no personal enemies.' Khan said authorities suspect that the Taliban carried out the attack. 'They are here, and they are the only people who can do it,' he said. The Taliban has assassinated numerous government employees in southern Afghanistan, hindering U.S. efforts to bolster the presence of the government in Kandahar and surrounding districts. 'I don't think it's a coincidence that there have been attacks on government officials,' said Ben Rowswell, chief of the Canadian-led provincial reconstruction team in Kandahar. 'That's what you would expect from an insurgency that feels threatened by efforts to connect the people to their government.' Last week, a suicide bomber killed more than 50 people celebrating the wedding of a police officer in Arghandab. Western officials say it has been hard to recruit bureaucrats and police officers in Kandahar and other provinces where the central government has historically had a weak presence, because southern Afghanistan remains volatile and civil servants earn modest wages. Building up the local government is the cornerstone of an embattled NATO campaign to secure Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the heartland of the Taliban. At least 44 NATO troops have been killed in Afghanistan his month. Tuesday's casualties included two British troops killed in separate shootings in the restive southern province of Helmand, according to the British military. A Polish service member was killed in a rocket attack on a base in Ghazni province, in eastern Afghanistan. An American service member was killed in eastern Afghanistan, military officials said. The spike in casualties comes as the U.S. military is deploying an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan amid rising violence. The Taliban has responded by stepping up attacks against NATO troops and allied Afghan officials. 'This is a tough loss,' Brig. Gen. Frederick Hodges, one of the top U.S. commanders in southern Afghanistan, said of Jabar's death. 'We knew the enemy was going to fight back because of the dramatic improvements that have taken place in Arghandab.' Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, condemned the assassination. 'This attack shows the insurgents cannot offer a better alternative for peace and security,' McChrystal said in a statement. 'Their actions will only increase the suffering of those who seek a better future for Afghanistan.' _ Special correspondent Javed Hamdard in Kabul contributed to this report. "
1,"NEW YORK - New York City officials are studying a proposal to extend the No. 7 subway line from Manhattan under the Hudson River to Secaucus after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie killed plans for a tunnel linking the states. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration said the subway plan would double commuter capacity and spur regional economic growth. Christie on Oct. 27 canceled the train tunnel, saying New Jersey couldn't afford as much as $5 billion in potential overruns on the $8.7 billion initial cost of the project. Running the subway line from Manhattan's far west side to a rail station in Secaucus might reduce the project's cost to about $5.3 billion, officials said. It also promises billions of dollars in new jobs and increased home values by linking Manhattan and Long Island City, Queens, with the New Jersey suburbs, proponents said. 'Extending the 7 line to New Jersey could address many of the region's transportation-capacity issues at a fraction of the original tunnel's cost, but the idea is still in its earliest stages,' said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert Steel. The line is undergoing an extension from its current run from Flushing, Queens, to Times Square, with a planned terminus at 34th Street and 11th Avenue. The original goal of the $2.1 billion, city-funded extension was to open Manhattan's far west side to development. Rezoning and future growth in midtown Manhattan's office market may add 30 million square feet of space with 120,000 new workers in the next 30 years, according to an Economic Development Corp. memo obtained from a person familiar with its details, who declined to speak publicly before it is released. The area on the far west side, called Hudson Yards, was described by Bloomberg administration officials as Manhattan's last underdeveloped neighborhood. Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Related Cos., the chief developer of office towers, apartment buildings and cultural amenities planned for the area, declined to comment on the plan. The already completed tunnel work under Manhattan would drive down the cost of extending it across the river, planners say. It would also eliminate $4 billion required for property acquisition in the original New Jersey rail plan, dubbed ARC, an acronym for Access to the Region's Core. 'As the governor indicated when he ended ARC, he's open to new ideas to resolve the trans-Hudson transportation dilemma,' said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie. 'But any plan that is first feasible would need to be fair and equitable to New Jersey in that all jurisdictions benefitting from the tunnel would share the costs appropriately.' The plan's benefits include that it delivers the 'same capacity as ARC for half the cost,' 'facilitates economic growth' and 'provides infrastructure we can afford,' the Economic Development Corp. memo states. It also has the added advantages of avoiding the already overcrowded Penn Station at a time when officials expect ridership from New Jersey to increase to 62,000 from 39,000 per day over the next three decades, the memo said. New Jersey's northern suburbs may be the major suburban growth area in the region, with a projected 1.36 million population increase by 2035, the memo stated, citing studies by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, an organization of regional governments that works to coordinate how transit should be financed. Christie's killing of the ARC project means the state may have to repay the U.S. government $350 million already spent on the project, forgo $3 billion in additional federal aid and lose 3,000 construction-worker jobs federal and Port Authority officials said the tunnel would generate for the next decade. It also may have cost New York and New Jersey 44,000 jobs and $4 billion in additional income that would have come through economic growth, according to a 2008 study by New Jersey Transit.

1,"Major allegations of fraud in Afghanistan's presidential election topped 550 by Sunday, more than doubling the figure investigators reported just two days earlier, officials said. The spike indicates just how pervasive ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation may have been during the country's Aug. 20 vote, threatening the legitimacy of the election. The hundreds of complaints could also greatly delay final results, which cannot be announced until major fraud allegations have been investigated, and are already not expected until mid-September at the earliest. A delay could create a power vacuum in Afghanistan and the volume of allegations could foment violence if people feel they have been cheated. On Sunday, an election official was attacked in the south. Gunmen on motorbikes drove up to the home of the second-highest electoral official in Kandahar province and shot him as he walked out of his front gate to go to work, said Mohammad Samimi, a spokesman for the provincial electoral commission. Sharafuddin, who only goes by one name, was seriously wounded and is being treated in a military hospital, he said. Sharafuddin was the operations manager for the provincial commission, meaning he was in charge of the logistics of how polling stations would operate and how ballots would be handled. Partial results of the vote so far show President Hamid Karzai leading with 46.2 percent of votes, and top challenger Abdullah Abdullah with 31.4 percent. The count is based on votes from 35 percent of the country's polling stations. Karzai will need to reach 50 percent of the votes to avoid a two-man run-off. Polls had favored Karzai to win the election, though not necessarily in a single round. Karzai's popularity has waned in recent years over concerns about corruption and resurgent violence. He also has been criticized for recruiting former warlords to gain the votes they control. One of the most controversial of these, Uzbek warlord Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, flew into Afghanistan from Turkey shortly before election day to show his support for Karzai and left late last week, a representative said. 'The purpose of his coming to Afghanistan was to participate in the election and to support Karzai,' said Sayed Noorullah Sadat, the chief of Dostum's political party. Dostum is alleged to have been responsible for the deaths of up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners early in the Afghan war, and U.S. officials were critical of the decision to allow him to return. 'The United States maintains serious concerns about the prospective role of Mr. Dostum in today's Afghanistan,' the embassy said in a statement Sunday. Sadat said Dostum has no immediate plans to return to Afghanistan. Asked if a second round of voting might bring Dostum back, Sadat said it was premature to talk about a runoff with votes still being counted. He added that Turkey is Dostum's home and that Dostum has a medical condition that is easier to treat in Turkey. He did not provide further details. The independent Electoral Complaints Commission has received more than 2,000 allegations of fraud and intimidation on voting day or during the subsequent counting of ballots, said Nellika Little, a spokeswoman for the group. Of those, 567 have been deemed serious enough to affect the outcome of the poll if proved true, Little said. The commission had reported 270 major allegations on Friday. The commission is still evaluating complaints, so the figure could rise further. The widespread fraud allegations have raised concerns about whether Afghans will accept the certified results. Voting day was marred by low turnout amid Taliban threats and attacks. Fraud allegations against Karzai were also raised in the 2004 election. A joint U.N.-Afghan panel found many cases of ballot-box stuffing, but said there was no evidence it was widespread and only favored Karzai. Karzai received 55.4 percent of the votes in the 2004 election -- 39 percentage points ahead of his closest challenger. This time, several presidential candidates have leveled accusations of fraud, including allegations that electoral officials forced voters to cast ballots for certain candidates and marked unused ballots for their candidate after election day. Abdullah and other candidates have produced videos documenting many allegations and Abdullah has charged Karzai of mobilizing state resources to steal the election. Karzai's campaign has denied that and countered by accusing Abdullah's campaign of fraud. Both camps have urged the country to wait for the complaints commission to finish its work. Military operations and violent insurgent attacks have continued in the interim. On Saturday, militants killed a provincial counterterrorism chief in an ambush in eastern Afghanistan. Fayez Khan, who headed counterterrorism operations for Khost province, was driving home in a convoy with police and bodyguards when he was ambushed, said Tahir Khan Sabari, the province's deputy governor. On the same day in Kandahar, three civilians died in the blast of a roadside bomb struck by a police vehicle, said Fazen Mohammad Sherzad, the deputy police chief. Two police officers were wounded but none killed. Afghan and international forces battled insurgents on Friday in eastern Paktika province, killing about three dozen militants, said Capt. Elizabeth Mathias, a spokeswoman for U.S. forces. A NATO statement said the Afghan and international troops also destroyed weapons and a complex of bunkers belonging to the Haqqani militant network, which operates across the Afghan-Pakistan border. No casualties were reported for international or Afghan troops, nor for civilians. ------ Associated Press Writers Rahim Faiez and Amir Shah in Kabul and Noor Khan in Kandahar contributed to this report.

1,"Lucy Liang, a sales manager for Jiangsu Zhongxin Toys Co., disappointed potential clients from the U.S. and Europe inspecting the pink and yellow teddy bears crowding the toymaker's stall at China's biggest trade fair. 'My boss orders us to turn down all the orders for the good of the company' because China's yuan may rise, crimping profit margins, said Liang as she sipped tea in a corner of her stand. 'Even first-class economists can't predict whether the yuan will appreciate or by how much. How could we?' The country's toymakers accept profit margins of as narrow as 3 percent to stay competitive. The low profitability, coupled with payment periods of three months or more, means they are particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations, said Lin Songli, an analyst with Guosen Securities in Beijing. The yuan has gained 6.3 percent against the euro and 2.1 percent against the dollar so far this year. 'If the yuan rises to 6 to the dollar, we're doomed,' said Simon Pan, general manager of closely held Zhejiang Huangyan Hongfan Toys Factory. It's raising prices by 3 percent to 5 percent to offset the Chinese currency's gains, and further increases would mean losing customers, he said in an interview at his booth, which was filled with educational toys and metal brainteasers destined for the U.S. Adding to the companies' concerns, Asian leaders meeting in Hanoi this week may discuss calls for China to accelerate yuan gains after the Group of 20 finance chiefs agreed Oct. 23 in South Korea to refrain from weakening currencies to boost exports. China has capped the yuan's rise to about 2 percent since a June pledge to introduce more flexibility, leading to criticism that it provides an unfair advantage to its exporters. Premier Wen Jiabao has said a rapid climb for the currency would cause social and economic turmoil, hobbling the world's fastest- growing major economy. Some manufacturers say they've already been affected by the currency's gains as clients from the U.S., Europe and Japan continue to expect cheap prices when buying in China. 'Since the government re-valued the yuan, we have been declining long-term orders _ anything beyond six months _ because we might even lose money by then,' said Lin Ying, a sales manager at closely held, Guangdong-based Shantou Meichang Plastic Factory, which makes plastic blocks and beach toys. 'If the yuan keeps rising, life would certainly be even harder for us,' she said. Customers expect the same prices as last year, said Susie Ying, general manager for Shanghai Master Plastic Products. The maker of inflatable hot tubs and beach toys had to raise prices by about 15 percent, even as 'most of our customers can only accept a 7 percent to 8 percent rise,' Ying said. Her company is trying to focus on more expensive items because their margins tend to be better. 'From the purchase orders we received, high-value toys have taken the lead on demand,' said Karson Choi, executive director of Early Light International, a closely held Hong Kong-based toymaker whose clients include Mattel. The company didn't attend the Canton Fair. Still, Dalian Ponytoy Co., which sells rideable toy horses and zebras at a wholesale price of $200, said it's also hurt by gains in the Chinese currency. 'Two months ago, the dollar-yuan exchange rate was 6.8, now it's 6.65,' said Tony Nie, general manager of the closely held Dalian-based company. 'This has a huge impact on us. A few years ago, the exchange rate was 8 yuan to the dollar.' U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said during the G20 meetings that he expects China will allow the yuan to strengthen because officials understand it's in the interest both of domestic growth and global economic stability. Almost 70 percent of exporters project a decrease in orders if the yuan strengthens by another 2 percent against the U.S. dollar, according to a survey of 239 Chinese suppliers by Global Sources. 'Many companies, particularly those in labor-intensive industries, are running on paper-thin margins and have no room to absorb currency-exchange losses,' Craig Pepples, Global Sources' chief operating officer, said in an e-mailed statement. In contrast, Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, posted a profit margin of 9.7 percent last year, while No. 2 Hasbro had 9.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zhejiang Sunny Import & Export Co., which sells wooden blocks that can be rearranged to resemble vehicles and robots, tried to hedge against currency losses. It billed in euros, then lost money when the currency dropped against the yuan, officially known as the renminbi, said manager Liam Zhu. 'We changed back to the U.S. dollar, but now the U.S. dollar is fluctuating and the renminbi is still appreciating,' said Zhu. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Everyone loves a dark horse. And that goes double when it comes to presidential politics. Although being crowned the front-runner in a fight for the presidential nod conveys some benefits (money and media attention, mostly), there is something the electorate loves about getting behind an unknown candidate and riding him (or her) from worst to first - or close to it. James K. Polk is widely regarded as the original dark horse. His opponents mocked his anonymity - 'Who is James K. Polk?' - but he went on to become the country's 11th president. Dark horses populate modern presidential politics as well. In 2004, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean began the Democratic nomination fight as a blip on the radar screen (and even that may be overstating where he began the race). But, capitalizing on the anger toward President George W. Bush within the Democratic Party, Dean rode a populist wave to the top of the field - until the wave broke just before the Iowa caucuses. Four years later, another former small-state governor - Arkansas' own Mike Huckabee - used his charisma and credentials as a social conservative to win in Iowa before ultimately fizzling out against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the GOP primary. As a result of his 2008 showing, Huckabee won't be able to claim dark horse status this time. So recent history then suggests that the 2012 Republican presidential field - one devoid of a clear front-runner - will produce a dark horse of its own. But who will it be? Here are four candidates who could fill the role: - Rick Santorum: The former senator from Pennsylvania has a niche - he's beloved by social conservatives - that might give him a base of support in the Iowa caucuses and the South Carolina primary. Santorum, who lost his reelection bid badly to Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., in 2006, is an underrated candidate on the stump and probably would do enough to stand out at least once on a crowded debate stage. It's hard to imagine Santorum broadening his support beyond his (relatively) narrow swath of social conservatives, but he could still help sway the race toward someone else. - Mike Pence: House members don't have much luck in presidential races; they typically suffer from a lack of a national fundraising base and a stature gap with their better-known rivals. Pence, an Indianan who resigned from House leadership after the election to presumably pursue a presidential bid, is seen by his allies as one of the few potential candidates who is acceptable to fiscal and social conservatives. And Pence has wowed at some of the early 2012 campaign cattle calls with a blunt speaking style that resonates with voters. - Scott Brown: The Massachusetts Republican, who became a national star this year when he won a special election to replace the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.), will face serious political peril in the Bay State if he chooses to run for reelection. Democrats are already lining up to challenge him and Republicans' inability to win the governor's race or the open 10th District in November has to be a discouraging sign for Brown. Given that - and his proven skills as a candidate - it's not entirely implausible that he could decide to run for national office instead. - Marco Rubio: Sure, Rubio won't even be sworn into the Senate until early next year. And, yes, he's only 39. But the Florida senator-elect is already a national star, a conservative favorite and a proven fundraiser ($18 million - at least - collected for his campaign). Barack Obama changed the calculus for all rising political stars when he beat the first family of Democratic politics in the 2008 primary and then won 365 electoral votes in the general election. If no candidate emerges as a front-runner by summer of 2011, Rubio might go from dark horse to pole position. "
1,"MEXICO CITY -- Carlos Slim is facing the Mexican government's biggest effort in years to bring more competition to the wireless market dominated by his America Movil. The billionaire is likely to turn back the challenge, analysts say. Grupo Televisa and Telefonica plan to offer wireless high-speed Internet across Mexico for the first time after winning airwaves in a government auction, the nation's first since 2005. The companies also won the right this year to use public fiber-optic lines to fortify their networks and compete against America Movil. While those new assets may bring Mexicans lower prices for mobile phones and services such as Web access, they're unlikely to do real damage to Slim's profits in Mexico, said Richard Dineen, an analyst at HSBC. America Movil's Mexican division is its most profitable and the fourth most profitable carrier in the world, according to Merrill Lynch. 'Their budget for various activities, whether it's engineering, investment, marketing, is often equivalent to the summed budgets of their competitors,' Dineen said. 'That is a formidable competitor.' Through March, the Mexican unit, called Telcel, had 71 percent of Mexican phone subscribers, while Telefonica, its next-biggest rival, held 21 percent. Telcel's share of the market was the largest of operators in 50 countries studied by Merrill Lynch in a report released in April. America Movil is the foundation of Slim's wealth, helping make him the richest man in the world, according to Forbes magazine. His stake in the company now makes up almost three- quarters of his $57 billion in publicly disclosed holdings, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The company's shares have increased 166 percent over the past five years, compared with a 122 percent increase in Mexico's IPC index. America Movil acquired a stake of 59 percent this year in Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest land-line phone carrier. Through last quarter, the Mexican wireless unit represented about half the profits of America Movil. While the companies operate separately and Telmex must accept traffic from America Movil rivals, having Telmex under its control can help America Movil plan investments, such as where to put its equipment to align with Telmex's network, said Tomas Lajous, an analyst at UBS. 'What's going to be key for this war is infrastructure,' Lajous, who recommends buying America Movil shares, said. 'It now becomes about execution and investment, and that's where it's really tough to compete.' "

1,"General Motors is recalling 1.53 million cars and trucks worldwide because fires can be ignited by components that heat windshield-washer fluid. The company will disable the heating mechanism in the washers of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Hummer and Saturn brands from model years 2006 to 2009, according to an e-mailed statement Tuesday. It said it will pay owners $100 for each vehicle because the feature won't be available and the maker of the units is out of business. 'One big recall probably won't hurt GM if it's just one big recall,' said Jim Hall, a principal at 2953 Analytics Inc., a consulting firm in Birmingham, Mich. 'They have to market on so many fronts. The last thing they need to do is counter market against a recall.' Toyota recalled more than 8 million vehicles worldwide for defects that may cause unintended acceleration. Following the recalls, U.S. regulators stepped up scrutiny of auto safety, and Congress is considering measures to tighten regulation of the industry. GM's heated windshield washer, which the company said was supplied by Micro-Heat Inc., was recalled in 2008 for repairs. The automaker received five reports of fires in the components in the past year, prompting today's action, the company said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had investigated a windshield-wiper flaw before GM issued the 2008 recall. The regulator in 2004 fined GM $1 million, at the time its largest civil penalty, to settle charges the company failed to conduct a timely recall of about 600,000 vehicles for wipers that stopped working or failed to turn on when needed. Micro-Heat, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after GM stopped offering its HotShot wiper-fluid heater, was based in Farmington Hills, Mich. GM in 2008 said Micro-Heat should bear the $19.2 million cost of recalling 944,000 cars and trucks for the earlier recall, according to court papers in the bankruptcy filing. 'This was a unique technology available from only one supplier, and that supplier has stopped manufacturing, which left no opportunity to collaborate on an improved design,' said Jeff Boyer, GM executive director of safety, in the statement. 'The voluntary payment to customers is for the loss of the feature, not the recall.' Tuesday's recall includes 1,365,070 vehicles in the U.S., 98,794 in Canada, 26,228 in Mexico and 38,093 exported to other countries, GM said. Vehicles included in the U.S. recall are the Buick Enclave and Lucerne; Cadillac CTS, DTS, Escalade, Escalade ESV and Escalade EXT; Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado 3500, Suburban, Tahoe and Traverse; GMC Acadia, Sierra, Yukon and Yukon XL; Hummer H2; and Saturn Outlook. NHTSA this year fined Toyota, the world's largest automaker, $16.4 million, the highest civil penalty, for delays in notifying the agency about unintended acceleration defects.

1,"PARIS - The world's biggest bank isn't in the United States, where regulators banned lenders from proprietary trading, nor in Switzerland, which is doubling capital requirements. BNP Paribas is in France, which is doing neither. BNP Paribas' assets rose 34 percent in the three years through June, reaching $3.2 trillion, equal to the size of Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank, and Morgan Stanley combined. The Paris-based company may also have one of the lowest capital ratios among major European banks under new Basel rules, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated. Regulators around the world are considering how to rein in their biggest banks to avoid future bailouts without stifling an economic recovery. France, which will hold the rotating chair of the Group of 20 nations in 2011, is taking a laissez-faire approach even as concerns persist that Europe's sovereign debt crisis may pose renewed risks to financial stability. 'The French are pretending not to see this,' said Carmen Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of a 2009 book examining financial crises throughout history. 'What policy makers are doing is delaying the inevitable. But delaying malaise is not unique to the French.' The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets capital standards for banks worldwide, softened planned capital and liquidity requirements in September and gave lenders about a decade to comply. France and Germany led efforts to weaken regulations proposed by the committee in 2009, concerned that their banks and economies wouldn't be able to bear the burden of tougher rules until a recovery takes hold, according to bankers, regulators and lobbyists involved in the talks. The Basel committee agreed to increase the minimum common equity requirement to 7 percent of assets, weighted according to their risks, from 2 percent previously. Individual countries may enforce higher capital requirements for their biggest lenders. Switzerland, which pushed for tougher rules, is moving ahead with additional restrictions to curb risks from its biggest banks. A government-appointed committee proposed last month that UBS and Credit Suisse Group, the country's largest banks, should hold almost twice as much capital as required under the new Basel rules. Britain may follow with similar requirements, Morgan Stanley analysts said in an Oct. 20 report, while a British government commission is also examining whether the largest banks should be broken up. In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act, signed by President Barack Obama in July, prohibits banks such as New York-based Goldman Sachs from engaging in trading for their own account. Banks' size wasn't the main indicator of whether they posed a risk during the financial crisis, and regulators should be wary of making rules specifically targeting size, Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said at a press conference with French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde in Paris on Oct. 15. 'Asking for more capital isn't necessarily more virtuous if it's simply the counterparty to more risk,' Noyer said. 'If banks in some countries have very risky profiles and regulators ask them to hold more capital, it's their problem. Don't conclude that everyone has to do exactly the same thing.' France last month passed a law to increase the power of supervisors over bonuses and rating companies. Starting next year, France will also introduce a 'systemic tax on big banks' riskiest activities,' according to the finance ministry. 'I see absolutely no reason whatsoever that we should be asked any capital surcharge,' BNP Paribas Chief Executive Officer Baudouin Prot, 59, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. 'You should ask a capital surcharge from the banks whose business model, whose track record has been between bad and horrendous. And there have been a number of them, but not for BNP Paribas.' Frederic Oudea, the CEO of Societe Generale, France's No. 3 bank by assets, told a French parliament hearing this week that the financial crisis showed 'size isn't linked to risk.' Applying capital standards like those planned in Switzerland 'makes no sense' in France, and could curb lending or make it more expensive, he said. BNP Paribas spent about $43 billion on acquisitions since 2000, including the 2009 purchase of Fortis assets in Belgium and Luxembourg, data compiled by Bloomberg show, making it the biggest bank by deposits in the euro area. The number of employees has doubled to more than 200,000 since 2004. 'The French government clearly desires to defend and promote French banks' capacity to expand abroad,' said Nicolas Veron, a senior economist at Brussels- based economics research organization Bruegel. The fact that French banks did better in the last crisis 'doesn't mean that France has no systemic-risk problems. You must think about scenarios of future risks.' Because French banks had a 'milder' crisis, the country sees less reason for a change in regulation, said Reinhart, who co-wrote the 2009 book, 'This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly' with Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor. Even countries such as the U.S. that had a 'systemic crisis,' are doing less than they should, she said. France's four largest banks _ BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and Groupe BPCE _ passed European Union stress tests in July, as did all but seven of the 91 banks scrutinized by regulators. The French lenders, which taken together account for 80 percent of the nation's banking assets, have enough capital to outlast an economic slowdown and a sovereign-debt crisis, according to the tests. The French banks probably won't face stricter capital and liquidity requirements because of their importance for the economy, Dirk Hoffmann-Becking, a London- based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said. Introducing tougher rules would 'take away their livelihood and the guy who's going to pay for it is the French consumer on the street.' _ _ _ Elena Logutenkova reported from Zurich; with assistance from Yalman Onaran in New York and Mark Deen and Olivia Sterns in Paris.

1,"First lady Michelle Obama returned to the White House last week after spending her summer vacation walking the fine fashion line between comfortably casual and utterly camera-ready. Her travel attire served as a wake-up call to all those American tourists who have blighted the national landscape with their ill- fitting shorts, sad-sack T-shirts and aggressively revealing tank tops: You can do better. More than her cocktail dresses, evening gowns and the rest of her official wardrobe, which all draw boisterous analysis, Obama's vacation clothes are positioned to have the most widespread impact. Please, let it be so. In a society where public attire has grown increasingly pajama-fied, the first lady offered proof that informal doesn't mean sloppy and pulled-together doesn't have to be stuffy. The summertime challenge for the 46-year-old, athletic first lady and mother of two tweens was balancing the wardrobe requirements for biking, miniature golfing and beach lounging with the fact that all those images would be logged into the historical record. She could not remain placidly at rest while her children played hard. 'Let's move,' after all, is her battle cry. Still, she is the first lady. Vacation or not, public trip or private visit, with a security detail and local cops on call, she remains in the spotlight. After all the criticizing that was done in this column over her unfortunate summer 2009 decision to disembark from Air Force One wearing mid-thigh hiking shorts for (begin ital) strolling (end ital)_ not hiking, not rappelling, not running _ the Grand Canyon, it seems only fair to take note of this summer's wardrobe, which struck all the right chords. Obama spent her month-long holiday wearing a mix of unfussy sundresses, feminine tank tops and sporty pedal pushers. For all the inferences read into the first couple's vacation destinations, from Panama City Beach, Fla. _ The beaches are safe! _ to Martha's Vineyard _ Isn't this where all the Democratic presidents go? _ there was also a take-away message from the first lady's wardrobe. Through her vacation apparel, with its mix of Banana Republic and Narciso Rodriguez, Obama threw down the gauntlet, providing folks with a high-profile lesson on how to be a well-dressed tourist who does not cause the locals to flinch in dismay. Yet she still managed to convey a middle-of-the-road Americanness. She represented the populace in a manner that was approachable but savvy. In the most prominent photograph from her trip to Spain, she was wearing a black and white one-shoulder top by designer Jean Paul Gaultier. Certainly, Gaultier doesn't come cheap, but the blouse wasn't ostentatious and, paired with black trousers, it was a fine example of how to be bare without baring all. During a game of miniature golf, she wore a Banana Republic tank top _ mass market but with a sophisticated sensibility. For dinners out with the president in Martha's Vineyard, she tucked black leggings under a Duro Olowu patchwork tunic, and she wore Rodriguez's black and white summer dress with a cropped black cardigan. Nothing about her choices was particularly avant-garde. They weren't scorchingly highfalutin in their style. If one tried to dissect the selections as evidence of some political intent, the single most applicable word would be 'global.' Creativity is not limited by borders. With the Rodriguez dress, she again brought attention to classic American silhouettes. In Gaultier, she heralded a Frenchman known for his interest in outsiders, immigrant cultures and the unique beauty found in a multitude of ethnic backgrounds. And Olowu is a Nigerian-born designer now based in London. He is the rare prominent black designer with his name on his own label. Of course, most women don't have the pressure of being constantly trailed by photographers to push them to take an extra peek in the mirror before heading out. They are not chauffeured hither and yon in a motorcade. No matter how hot the day, one never seems to see a giant sweat stain spreading across the first lady's back as she waves to a crowd. Is the atmosphere inside the security bubble magically air-conditioned? Unlike the first lady, everyday tourists are not the center of attention. Still, when regular folks travel abroad, they represent both themselves and the collective American identity. Must we continue to be perceived as the most poorly dressed of all tourists? And for those who remain in the States during the final long weekend of the summer, as you visit national parks and local beaches, remember: We are all part of the landscape. We are part of the postcard image, the memory that's tucked into a scrapbook. We should do our best not to mar this country's natural beauty. givhanr@washpost.com MORE PHOTOS See more images of Michelle Obama's summer vacation style at washingtonpost.com/style. givhanr@washpost.com "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: It was just a week ago that a defiant Marion Barry tried to bully the special investigators who had detailed his latest ethical transgressions. He defended his conduct ('I'm a different kind of council member'), took umbrage ('even my public enemies ... have never implied that I ever took a penny that wasn't owed to me') and impugned the investigation ('Asking people about sexual relationships. Asking people if (they've) seen me do drugs. That is totally inappropriate'). So forgive us if Mr. Barry's newfound words of regret ring hollow to us. 'I am truly sorry. I am truly sorry,' the Ward 8 council member said Tuesday as he apologized for improperly giving a city contract to a girlfriend who, according to the findings of special counsel Robert S. Bennett, did poor work and shared the proceeds with Mr. Barry. He owned up to a lack of judgment but insisted he violated no laws. He said nothing of allegations that he steered thousands of dollars in city money to questionable groups that benefited his close friends and political supporters. The event _ during which Mr. Barry took no questions _ was cynically staged inside Union Temple Baptist Church in D.C. It brought to mind a similar scene in 1990 when, days after the then-mayor was caught on tape taking drags from a crack pipe, he showed up at another church in Southeast Washington to confess a 'weakness' for which he would seek help. Or the day four years ago in U.S. District Court, when Mr. Barry apologized profusely for failing to file tax returns and relapsing into drug use. 'How much longer do we have to hear a 73-year-old man discuss his lack of judgment?' asked council member David A. Catania, I-At Large. It is clear that Mr. Barry is hoping his apology will dissuade his colleagues from taking any action when the council meets next week; after all, it's worked before. The council can't remove Mr. Barry from office, but it could censure him, strip him of important committee assignments and refer the allegations to the U.S. attorney's office and the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance. Even if the council invokes the toughest sanctions available to it _ and we think it should _ it won't be enough to make up for what Mr. Barry's repeated misbehavior has cost the very people he professes to serve. It frankly is disgusting to hear Mr. Barry talk, as he did Tuesday, about the needs of his resource-poor community when his main agenda has been his own welfare. He seems not to recognize the connection between the deprivations of Ward 8 and his lack of effective leadership. If Mr. Barry were really sorry, he would realize it is time for him to make way for someone who can deliver. Or, at the very least, to pay back the money wasted on girlfriends and cronies. "
1,"Searchers on Wednesday will attempt to enter a North Carolina meat products plant ripped apart by an explosion that killed at least two workers, officials said. One worker was still unaccounted for. Overnight storms forced teams to suspend their search of the ConAgra Foods Inc. manufacturing plant just south of Raleigh because rainwater made the damaged roof heavier and more dangerous, Police Sgt. Chris Clayton said. Searchers were meeting to determine how to safely enter the massive building where Slim Jim meat snacks were made. Clayton said the bodies of the two victims were located in the rubble about 150 feet (45 meters) inside the plant. They hadn't been recovered because of the roof and structure danger. Officials also said ammonia that was released in the explosion Tuesday morning was no longer a threat and schools in the area planned to proceed with classes. Some roads in the area were still closed. Clayton said 300 workers were in the plant when the blast occurred and 38 employees were injured, including four with critical burns. Three firefighters were treated for inhaling ammonia fumes and released. ConAgra spokeswoman Stephanie Childs said a fund was being set up to help families of victims and that employees would continue to be paid. Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said families were 'somewhat in limbo. They're in a ton of uncertainty.' The blast collapsed an exterior wall, smashing cars parked next to the 500,000-square-foot (46,000-square-meter) building. Authorities could not say where in the plant the blast happened or what caused it, but some workers who escaped said chaos and panic followed. Janelle Lynch, who has worked at the plant for eight years, said she saw flames and ran. She planned to leave through the cutting department, but the roof started to collapse, so she went in the other direction and escaped through a warehouse. 'I saw a fire and things just started exploding,' she said. About 900 people cover four shifts at the plant, one of ConAgra's largest, Jackson said. The ammonia is used to refrigerate meat before it's turned into Slim Jims. The company, which has 25,000 employees worldwide, makes brands like Chef Boyardee, Hunt's tomato sauce, ACT II popcorn and Hebrew National hot dogs. The plant was last inspected by the North Carolina Department of Labor for workplace safety last July and no violations were found, department spokeswoman Dolores Quesenberry said. The plant had violations in previous years, including a fine in 2007 for problems with eye and face protection equipment. "
1,"Melanie Oudin extended her remarkable run at the U.S Open to the quarterfinals with another thrilling victory, 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3 over 13th-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia. The 17-year-old Oudin staved off two points that would have put her behind 5-3 in the second set, then rolled through the third, hitting corners with those underrated groundstrokes and taking advantage of 22 unforced errors by her more-seasoned, higher-ranked opponent. Rankings, like her age, however, are only numbers. The 70th-ranked player already had wins over No. 4 Elena Dementieva and No. 29 Maria Sharapova at Flushing Meadows, along with one over former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic this summer at Wimbledon. Now, she's knocked off No. 13. She has become the youngest American to move into the quarterfinals at America's Grand Slam since Serena Williams in 1999. 'I think this is going to do a lot,' Oudin said. 'I think it's good for American tennis.' Not so good for Russian tennis, though. All four of Oudin's wins have come against Russians and her next match could be against yet another. That's sixth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 Open champion and the only Grand Slam tournament winner left on Oudin's side of the bracket. After hitting a forehand to the corner for her 19th and final winner on match point, Oudin threw her racket in the air. This time, however, she didn't cry any tears of disbelief. Instead, it was twin sister Katherine sobbing in the stands. 'It's kind of hard to explain how I've done it,' Melanie said. 'Today, there were no tears because I believed I can do it. Now I know I do belong here. This is what I want to do. I can compete with these girls no matter who I'm playing. I have a chance against anyone.' Talk about heart. Oudin improved to 6-1 at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open this year when she's lost the first set. She is 17-4 overall this year in three-set matches. 'I don't actually mean to lose the first set,' she insisted. 'Sometimes, I just start off slowly. Maybe I'm a little nervous. Today, my timing was off a little. But I just totally forgot about it, started off the second set like it was a new match, and I started playing better.' Oudin won this match without serving a single ace, another indication she is not blowing anybody away with sheer power. Instead, it's footwork, technique, precision. Mostly, though, she is thriving in pressure situations that make so many others in the sport shrink away. 'You don't know if she's winning or losing,' said her father, John. 'She doesn't seem nervous out there -- and I don't know where that came from.' Maybe it's the shoes. They have the word 'Believe' stamped on them, and it's easy to see how those Oudin models could become top sellers in tennis shops across America soon. The teenager, schooled at home in Marietta, Ga., so she can concentrate on tennis, stung two forehand winners, including one when she was positioned completely outside the court, to take a quick 3-0 lead in the second-set tiebreaker. She also took advantage of three unforced errors and a double-fault from her 27-year-old opponent, who was trying to make her third Open quarterfinal. 'I have a feeling like I really didn't finish my job off on the court,' Petrova said. 'She came back, and after winning her previous matches in the same way, she probably thought, I can do it again.' In men's play, No. 1 Roger Federer beat No. 14 Tommy Robredo of Spain 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 for his 38th straight win at the U.S. Open. In the quarterfinals, Federer will face No. 12 Swede Robin Soderling, who he beat in the French Open final to complete his career Grand Slam. Soderling advanced when No. 8 Nikolay Davydenko of Russia retired with a leg injury at the start of the fourth set. American John Isner lost to No. 10 Fernando Verdasco of Spain 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, assuring the men's quarterfinals will be without an American for the first time in history. In other women's matches Monday, Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine and Belgian Yanina Wickmayer won to set up a quarterfinal between two players ranked in the 50s. Little in the women's tournament has gone to form. Unseeded Kim Clijsters, into the quarterfinals in her comeback to pro tennis after a two-year break, is shredding up her side of the draw. Oudin is electrifying the other side. Four of the top five seeds are gone, with only No. 2 Serena Williams bringing any sense of stability to the proceedings. She has yet to be challenged in any of her four matches. "

1,"Job openings rose sharply earlier this year, a sign that U.S. employers might be preparing to step up hiring. The number of openings in January rose about 7.6 percent, to 2.7 million, compared with December, the Labor Department said. And the job openings rate climbed to 2.1 percent, the highest in nearly a year. That rate measures available jobs as a percentage of total employment. There are now about 5.5 unemployed people, on average, competing for each opening. That's still far more than the 1.7 people who were competing for each opening when the recession began. But it's down from just over 6 people per opening in December 2009. The gradually brightening jobs picture corresponds to what many job search Web sites are reporting. "
1,Police say a fourth person has died and three people are still missing following a double avalanche in the Swiss Alps on Sunday. Police in Bern canton (state) said Monday the fourth victim died of injuries in the hospital. Three people were confirmed dead Sunday after a group of skiers and then the rescuers who came to their aid were hit by avalanches in the Diemtig Valley about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the capital Bern. Among those killed was an emergency doctor who was part of the initial rescue team. It was unclear Monday whether officials would be able to resume the rescue and recovery operation that was halted at nightfall. Officials are warning of heightened avalanche risk in the Swiss Alps following heavy snowfall. 
1,"STOCKHOLM - At least 17 immigrants have been injured in the Swedish city of Malmo in a yearlong shooting spree that has revived memories of similar attacks two decades ago and fanned fears of spiraling anti-immigrant sentiment. Two women, aged 26 and 34, were shot at through the kitchen window of a ground floor apartment in the neighborhood of Kroksbaeck Thursday, police spokesman Lars-Haakan Lindholm said. A 28-year-old man was shot at a bus stop two days earlier, Oct. 19, following the shooting of a 47-year-old man at another bus stop Oct. 10. This weekend, shots were fired at a tailor's shop and through an apartment window. 'The people who are immigrants care a lot about what is happening and are worried,' said Filiz, a hairdresser in Malmo who didn't want her full name to be published. 'They double- check that they have locked their doors at night and make sure all curtains have been drawn. It is frightening.' Between 40 and 50 police are investigating the unexplained shootings in the south-Swedish port city, which has a population of about 300,000. Some of the incidents are connected, Lindholm said and all appear to have targeted non- Swedes. A shooting in October last year, in which a 20-year-old woman was killed and a 21-year old man was injured in a car near Vaestra Skraevlinge church, may also be related. The shootings have brought back memories of the 'Laserman,' who killed one person and shot at 10 others in Stockholm during six months in 1991 and 1992. All of the victims had dark hair or skin color. John Ausonius, known as the 'Laserman' because he used a gun with a laser sight, was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 after the biggest police hunt since the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme. The incidents in Malmo since last year have rekindled fears about racism in a country where an anti-immigration party won seats in parliament in last month's election. There are parallels between the 'Laserman' and the Malmo shootings, said Jerzy Sarnecki, a professor in criminology at Stockholm University. 'There are obvious similarities -- as this time it is also someone shooting at people with an immigrant background,' said Sarnecki. 'If it's the way it seems, that this person is targeting people of an immigrant background, there are also parallels to craziness that may have been triggered by the current political climate, just like with the Laserman.' During the banking crisis that started in 1990, which lifted unemployment to levels close to 13 percent, the anti- immigration New Democracy party became kingmakers in parliament. The Sweden Democrats won 5.7 percent of the vote in the general election on Sept. 19 this year, throwing the government of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt into a minority. That followed Sweden's deepest recession since World War II last year. Malmo police are investigating right-wing groups as one of the possible leads in the attacks and have warned people who don't look like ethnic Swedes about being out at night. About 40 percent of the city's population are immigrants, or have two parents born outside of Sweden, the city of Malmo estimates. 'There are a lot of people here who are very worried and there is a lot of talk about what is happening,' Shahn, who works at a video store in Malmo and didn't want her surname to be published, said by telephone. 'This could be some sick youths that are doing the same thing that has happened before.' "
1,"In the view of certain members of Congress, the problem with constitutional rights in this country is that every American gets them. Once you are either born into citizenship or earn it through naturalization, it's almost impossible for the government to take it away. What has some lawmakers angry these days is that terrorism suspects get the full panoply of constitutional protections if, by some peculiar twist of fate, they happen to be American citizens. With the arrest of a Pakistani-born naturalized American charged with trying to car bomb Times Square, citizenship seems suddenly like one of those bizarre legal technicalities that stand in the way of justice and national security. It isn't, and it doesn't. Yes, agents read Faisal Shahzad the same Miranda warnings, and the law gives him the same due process rights that the Constitution grants the rest of us, including who knows how many law-abiding citizens he was apparently trying to kill. So what? The law already allows cops to delay the Miranda warning under exigent circumstances, such as the possibility that another bomb is about to detonate. Until they were satisfied there was no assault in the works, agents questioned Shahzad without reminding him he didn't have to talk. That is also what they did with the Christmas Day underwear bomber, arrested at the Detroit airport. It was only after initial questioning that authorities advised them of the right to remain silent and their right to counsel. In both cases, the suspects kept talking anyway. 'A stroke of good luck,' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called Shahzad's chattiness. 'A serious mistake,' is how Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., characterized the Mirandizing of Shahzad. It was no mistake. Nor was it a mistake when agents during the previous administration Mirandized shoe bomber Richard Reid and every other suspected terrorist arrested on U.S. soil, no matter their nationality. But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, already a proponent of citizenship-stripping for suspected terrorists, is hoping the outrage over Mirandizing Shahzad will help push a bill he introduced this week. The Terrorist Expatriation Act would allow the de- Americanizing of anyone who supports any group the State Department says is a terrorist organization. An independent from Connecticut, Lieberman says the bill would merely update a 1940s-era law that says Americans who join forces with an enemy engaged in hostilities against the U.S. would lose their citizenship. First of all, the Supreme Court has made the existing law tricky to apply. A 1967 ruling said the government can't force expatriation on an unwilling citizen. The court later said the government can revoke citizenship for someone it can prove intended to relinquish his rights, say by signing up with an active enemy. Lieberman's idea would go so much further than the current law. Supporting the wrong organization, one which may have educational as well as terror-mongering facets, is a far cry from taking up arms against your country. And if the whole idea of the Lieberman law is to deny such a person the right to due process at the time of the arrest so that no Miranda reading is required, the timing is all wrong. Let me here quote, of all people, House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner. 'If they're a U.S. citizen, until they're convicted of some crime, I don't know how you would attempt to take their citizenship away,' Boehner told reporters. And of course you can't convict a citizen of a crime without, ahem, giving him due process of law. And that includes protection against self-incrimination, the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. The point behind the rigmarole is that without a fair trial, you can't really know who committed what wrongdoing, who has been framed or who is the victim of mistaken identity. In the unlikely event that Congress passes this bill, and in the even less likely event it is found to be constitutional, it couldn't and wouldn't apply retroactively to Shahzad, as Lieberman acknowledges. The ultimate aim of those unhappy about Mirandizing possible terrorists is to make sure they get no civilian trial and instead get tossed into a brig to await a military tribunal, if we ever get around to it. Oh, wait. We tried that with suspected dirty bomber Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen arrested at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. He was kept in solitary confinement at a South Carolina naval brig for years. That brig thing-y didn't work out so well, so Padilla wound up in a civilian trial where he was convicted on completely different charges and locked away for 17 years. What is with this insistence on military tribunals anyway? For results, there is nothing like a good old-fashioned criminal trial in civilian court. More than 400 men and women charged with terrorism-related crimes have been tried and convicted in civilian court, sentenced to long prison stints and sent off to U.S. penitentiaries on American soil. The precise number of suspected terrorists convicted in military tribunals since the Sept. 11 attacks is three. Lieberman has come up with a drastic solution. Now all he needs is a Constitution that would allow it and, oh yeah, a problem that it would solve. Ann Woolner is a Bloomberg News columnist. "

1,"Republican House candidate Tom Ganley sold more than 800 cars last summer through the 'Cash for Clunkers' government rebate program. But does Uncle Sam get a thank you? 'Let's talk about Cash for Clunkers,' the voluble millionaire, who owns the largest auto dealership group in Ohio, told a group of voters here recently. 'It created a 30-day surge in auto sales. After it ended, there was no business. It was like the faucet was shut off.' As the nation struggled through a painful recession, the Democratic-led Congress rushed through nearly $1 trillion in spending and tax cuts, aiming to jump-start business investment, keep state and local governments afloat and put people to work, if only temporarily. Most economists say the nationwide stimulus effort has generally paid off, although they differ on how much. But the cash infusion appears to have done little to restore public confidence either in the federal government or in the Democratic Party. The stimulus may have created or saved up to 3.6 million jobs, as the White House contends, but the jobless rate in Ohio still hovers at a crippling 10.4 percent. That has left Democrats like Ganley's opponent, Rep. Betty Sutton, trying to convince voters that the stimulus made a bad situation somewhat less bad. That doesn't exactly pop off a bumper sticker. Sutton, a longtime state representative who was elected to Congress in 2006, led the effort to pass Cash for Clunkers. Her northern Ohio district, a blue-collar swath that stretches from Akron to Lake Erie, is heavily dependent on the auto industry. Sutton thought she would scored a legislative coup when President Barack Obama signed the Clunkers bill into law. The rebates of up to $4,500 for people who traded in old cars for more-fuel-efficient new models were one of the few stimulus programs to attract broad bipartisan support. It was so popular that it required a second federal cash infusion. But Sutton is a top target of Republicans, in part because of her support for the program. Her opponent's 31 dealerships sold an estimated $17 million worth of cars through Clunkers rebates, but he now denounces the program as a fiscal folly. 'I'm against government intervention of any kind,' Ganley asserts. The stimulus 'creates work and not jobs,' Ganley told the gathering of voters. 'That may sound like a contradiction, but as we drove out here today there were all the orange barrels out on the highway, and all this work was being done with money from the stimulus. But as soon as that road's finished, the work's gone.' Polls have shown that many Americans view the stimulus as a bust. Sutton _ who has been stuck working in Washington for most of the summer as Ganley campaigns in the state _ said she realizes that it won't be easy to convince some voters that Democrats did the right thing. 'There are trust issues,' Sutton said in an interview in her Capitol Hill office. The loss of faith in government 'hurts our country in politics and in spirit. There's a lot of anxiety, and I understand the anxiety.' How can nearly $1 trillion flush through the U.S. economy, with tangible results, and still leave voters dubious? Some blame Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress for failing to set clear and realistic expectations. The centerpiece of the stimulus effort, the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act approved in February 2009, included a sprawling array of policy initiatives. Obama got to deliver on campaign promises to invest in alternative energy and advance high-speed rail development. Liberals got their funding for Head Start and community food banks, and centrists got middle-class tax breaks. (Republicans saw very little in the package that they liked; only three GOP Senators and no Republican House members voted for it.) It proved difficult to keep track of all that spending, and the White House and Democratic leaders had a hard time showing how it was contributing to the recovery. 'The branding and marketing was done very poorly,' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who supported the stimulus. 'When you spend that much money, there should be more recognition.' About $2 billion of the stimulus money flowed to Sutton's Ohio District. The funds are paying for 628 projects, making it one of the largest concentrations of federal spending in the Midwest. Yet it could take months, even years, to see the benefits from some stimulus projects. In August of last year, Akron-based First Energy Service Co. applied for a $36 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to install 5,000 high-tech meters in Cleveland area homes, a project that would turn the region into a test market for 'smart grid' technology aimed at reducing energy consumption. Energy was one of Obama's stimulus priorities. With plans to eventually reach 44,000 households, the company could wind up creating an estimated 1,200 jobs in installation services, infrastructure upgrades and meter manufacturing. A year later, the project has yet to get under way. First Energy's application was approved in late October, but Ohio hasn't come through with $36 million in matching funds. 'There is a lot that goes into preparing something like this before the first dollar is spent or the customer sees any effect,' First Energy spokeswoman Ellen Raines said. Sutton hopes that voters will look beyond the road projects that are putting people to work short term and recognize the benefits of longer-term investments in new industries and a better-prepared work force. Lorain County Community College, which Obama visited in January, has retrained 600 unemployed residents using stimulus money, and about half have found jobs. Hundreds more are continuing to enroll. Ten years ago, about a third of Lorain County's jobs were in manufacturing. Today that figure is about 15 percent. 'It's not a short-term proposition,' said Marcia Ballinger, the college's vice president for strategic development. 'There are short-term pieces of it, but the problems just run so deep.' "
1,"'Plastic Beach' by Gorillaz is a musical mishmash. It's also ambitious and brilliant: 2010's best CD so far. The record jumbles sounds and styles: seagull squawks, orchestras, hip-hop, Bollywood, disco, reggae, folk, Sergei Prokofiev, space-age lullabies, techno and calypso. On paper, it resembles a disaster. The concept arose after its main creator, Damon Albarn of Blur, visited a Malian landfill. He despaired at the amount of plastic scattered worldwide, the aftermath of billions of microwave-ready meals. Albarn's list of guests is stunning. Lou Reed brings his New York deadpan to an environmental singalong, 'Some Kind of Nature.' The Fall's Mark E. Smith adds a northern English sneer to 'Glitter Freeze,' a slice of 1970s glam rock. Clash stars Paul Simonon and Mick Jones reunite for the title track. Snoop Dogg is followed by British grime rappers Kano and Bashy performing with the National Orchestra for Arabic Music. The best track, 'Stylo,' starts with an unemotional rap from Mos Def and then erupts into an impassioned soul rant by Bobby Womack. Only 'Superfast Jellyfish,' with its fake ad jingle from De La Soul and Gruff Rhys, is a tad irritating. Intriguingly, about 70 songs were mooted for the album, including performances by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees. Let's hope we get to hear the outtakes too. The inventiveness revitalizes Gorillaz after more than a decade as a multimedia 'virtual group' drawn by London comic- book artist Jamie Hewlett. This time, the band is shipwrecked far from human life on a beach made of industrial waste where the members happily make shiny new toys from the trash, just like Albarn does with the music. 'Demon Days' five years ago was stunning; 'Monkey: Journey to the West' had its moments. With Gorillaz outselling Blur in the U.S., Albarn has found a new direction for Britpop and rock music in general. I've seen the future, and it works. The Gorillaz album is on Parlophone/Virgin. Download fees vary across services. Mark Beech writes for Bloomberg News. "
1,"A key Senate committee on Thursday approved a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, picking up enough Republican support to indicate that the pact could squeak through the full Senate. But a wild card emerged in the proceedings when Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said that the intelligence community had at the last minute produced 'some very serious information that directly affects what we're doing here.' He did not reveal what the information was. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he had been briefed on the new development and that 'the conclusion of the intelligence community is, it in no way alters their judgment already submitted to this committee with respect to the START treaty.' He also declined to describe the new intelligence. The senators approved the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by a vote of 14 to 4, making it eligible to go to the Senate floor, where it needs 67 votes to pass. It won the support of all the Democrats on the committee, as well as that of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a longtime arms-control proponent, and two other Republicans the administration had fought to win over - Sens. Bob Corker, Tenn., and Johnny Isakson, Ga. The treaty trims each side's long-range deployed nuclear warheads to 1,550 and permits resumption of mutual inspections of arsenals, which lapsed when a predecessor treaty lapsed in December. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: Did Alan Simpson's mother never tell him to count to 10 before saying _ or e-mailing _ something he might regret? Apparently not. The Wyoming Republican, a former senator and now co-chair of President Barack Obama's fiscal responsibility commission, put, as he acknowledged, a size 15 foot in his mouth when he wrote to a critic that the Social Security program had become 'like a milk cow with 310 million tits.' Simpson apologized, but his itchy e-mail trigger finger played right into the hands of those who argue that a panel charged with finding ways to control the debt ought not to be mucking around with Social Security. An array of groups, including the Older Women's League, whose director wrote the column that set Simpson off, demanded his firing. The White House said it regretted Simpson's remarks _ we bet it did! _ but that he would remain on the panel. This episode is as unfortunate as it is predictable; Simpson has a penchant for remarks that are colorful bordering on intemperate. But his fundamental point is correct: Social Security is not on a sustainable footing. In his e-mail, Simpson pointed to a presentation by the chief actuary for Social Security, Stephen Goss, showing that by 2037 the program's reserves will have been drained and it will be able to pay only 76 percent of scheduled benefits. 'If you think the statistics on poverty for seniors are alarming _ then you need to read this little pamphlet to know what is really alarming,' Simpson wrote. The most sensible and least painful way to address this problem is to act sooner rather than later to make the relatively modest adjustments that will be needed. These changes should be done in a way that protects the most vulnerable seniors. But dawdling and hoping for better-than-expected economic news is not protecting that needy population. It is taking the risk of steep benefit cuts that would hurt these seniors the most. That is, we think, what Simpson's mother would have wanted him to say. "
1,"Reality Television The people behind the titles 'The Secret Life of Scientists & Engineers,' Nova This Web-only series, at www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/secretlife/(number sign), features interviews with working scientists who lead double lives. For example, there's Erika Ebbel, the biochemist _ and pageant queen. In a two-minute video, an interviewer asks Ebbel 10 questions about her twin occupations. Viewers find out that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad and former Miss Massachusetts would rather win the Nobel Prize than be crowned Miss America, prefers heels to flats and thinks that the worst part of competing in pageants is the glue she has to use to keep her swimsuit in place. Nova has interviewed about a dozen folks, including a climate scientist who juggles, a geologist who doubles as a Native American dancer and a roboticist who does extreme sports on the side. More videos will be added this month. The video vignettes not only entertain, they humanize scientists with intimidating job titles such as astrophysicist.

Cullen even foresees Xavier, a Category 4 hurricane, slamming into New York City in 2050. No climate model, no matter how sophisticated, could predict a hurricane that far in advance, so clearly Cullen is taking some creative license to make a point. Oddly, she writes in the past tense to describe future events. For example: 'Residents of South Australia awoke on the first morning in December 2019 to face yet another sustained warning of catastrophic fire danger.' Only time will confirm or contradict Cullen's grim outlook. "
1,"Second-seeded Dudi Sela of Israel was knocked out of the Indianapolis Championships by Alex Bogomolov Jr. of the United States 6-4, 7-6 (5) in the second round on Thursday. Top-seed Dmitry Tursunov advanced with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Marcos Daniel of Brazil, while Sam Querrey was another of the few seeded players who escaped the second round with a victory. The No. 3 seed, beat fellow American Rajeev Ram 7-5, 6-3. No. 7-seeded Marc Gicquel of France beat Jesse Levine of the United States 6-2, 6-2 while, in completing the first round, Marcos Daniel of Brazil won 6-2, 6-4 against wild card Taylor Dent of the United States, who was making his first appearance at Indianapolis since he reached the final four years ago. Daniel earned a second match of the day against top-seeded Dmitry Tursunov of Russia. Sela landed in only half of his first serves, making him struggle to hold serve against the American qualifier, who earned only his third win on tour this year. Fourth-seeded Igor Kunitsyn of Russia lost for a second straight time to Wayne Odesnik of the United States 2-6, 6-1, 6-1. Odesnik was the runner-up at Houston in April. Frank Dancevic of Canada beat No. 5 seed Benjamin Becker of Germany 6-2, 7-5. Ram beat Querrey in the finals of the ATP Hall of Fame Championship on July 12. This time, Querrey used his power to get 13 aces and keep Ram off balance. 'I feel like I played well,' Querrey said. 'I served well, hit my forehand well, I got to some balls I don't normally get to. Raj is tough. He's got a big serve.' "
1,"Consumers increased their spending in June for the second straight month, even as incomes fell sharply. The Commerce Department says consumers boosted their spending 0.4 percent, slightly ahead of analysts' estimates. That comes after spending rose 0.1 percent in May. The department says personal income fell 1.3 percent after rising by the same amount in May, when incomes were boosted by one-time payments from the Obama administration's stimulus package. Economists expected personal incomes, the fuel for future spending, to fall 1 percent. Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for about 70 percent of total U.S. economic activity. "
1,"Host nation Kenya won gold and bronze in the 10,000 meters race at the start of the African Athletics Championships on Wednesday. Wilson Kiprop won gold in a time of 27 minutes, 32.91 seconds and Geoffrey Mutai took bronze 27:33.83. Hopes of a clean sweep were thwarted by Uganda's Moses Ndiema Kipsiro, who won the silver in 27:33.37 after a close contest to the finish. The medalists took advantage of the absence of world and Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele, who is injured. Kipsiro said his strategy was to keep up with the Kenyans who broke away from the main pack in the 14th lap. 'I was just keeping my energy to finish the race,' he said. 'It was a tough race. Kenyans had a lot of morale because they are at their home ground.' Ethiopia is expected to rival Kenya for medals in the middle and long-distance races. The Ethiopian squad features Tirunesh Dibaba, the Olympic 5,000 and 10,000 gold medalist, who will compete over the shorter distance. It also includes the 2008 world indoor champion at 3,000, Tariku Bekele, the younger brother of Kenenisa, and who will race in the 5,000. More than 700 athletes are taking part in the event representing 53 African countries. The championships began under tight security following bomb attacks earlier this month in neighboring Uganda that killed 76 people watching the World Cup final on television on July 11. Spectators at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi were put through body searches and scans, while uniformed and plain clothes police patrolled the venue. The opening day also saw heats in the men's and women's 100 which were dominated by the Nigerians, who are expected to win the events despite the absence of Olusoji Fasuba, the men's African record holder.

1,"The winner of Tuesday's Sri Lankan presidential election must find a way to triumph in a long battle against inflation while sustaining economic growth in a nation still healing from a 26-year civil war. Voters will choose between President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his former army chief Sarath Fonseka, who quit in November. Rajapaksa, 64, called the poll two years early to capitalize on last May's defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels who had fought for a homeland in the north and east of the country, located off the southern tip of India. Peace lifted economic growth and helped make Sri Lankan stocks Asia's best- performing, buoyed by a construction spree and increased farm production in the former war zone. Sustaining that momentum will require taming an inflation rate that has frequently exceeded 20 percent, which has weakened the currency and deterred investment. 'We love the economy and its prospects but Sri Lanka has always struggled with monetary control,' said Roman Scott, chairman of Singapore-based Calamander Group, which runs a Sri Lankan private equity fund. 'Inflation and the threat of inflation lead foreigners to distrust the Sri Lankan rupee.' Rajapaksa has vowed to spend $4 billion, or almost 10 percent of Sri Lanka's gross domestic product, building roads, railways and power plants in the Tamil- dominated north. He says he'll hold elections for a provincial council and give Tamils a 'greater say' in governance. Fonseka, whose lack of political experience is offset by support from opposition parties and the main Tamil alliance, accuses his rival of corruption and economic mismanagement. He has promised to heal a racial divide born of a conflict that claimed more than 100,000 lives, as well as build roads and lure investment to boost growth. There have been no nationwide opinion polls given the difficulty of surveying voter intentions in the former war zone and the tight timeframe. In a poll on the Web site of the privately-run The Island newspaper, 53 percent of 2,458 readers who expressed an opinion said they expect Rajapaksa to be re- elected, while 43 percent predicted a Fonseka victory. There was no margin of error given for the survey. Postwar reconstruction helped drive growth above 4 percent and the central bank is predicting a 7 percent expansion in 2010. The growth spurt already pushed the inflation rate to a nine- month high of 4.8 percent in December. As recently as June 2008, consumer prices in Colombo jumped 28 percent from a year earlier. 'From a business angle it's important to have inflation in single digits but in a growing economy you won't be able to keep it that low,' said Hasitha Premaratne, head of corporate finance at Colombo-based Brandix, the nation's biggest apparel exporter. 'Still, high variations in inflation have to be controlled.' The next president must also practice fiscal restraint after the island negotiated a $2.6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund in July. In return, Sri Lanka agreed to reduce its budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011, from an estimated 7 percent in 2009. While 22 candidates are vying for the presidency, the campaign has been conducted as a two-man race. Voters will get to list their top three choices for president. If either Rajapaksa or Fonseka gets 50 percent plus one ballot he will be declared the winner. If not, the second and third preferences of those who didn't vote for either leading contender will be counted, according to the Election Commission. Fonseka, 59, fell out with the president over who should take credit for the war victory. He has no experience running an economy and is backed by a disparate opposition. The 'hastily arranged' coalition backing Fonseka 'does not give foreigners a strong signal,' said Scott. 'What they crave is stability above all.' A victory for Rajapaksa would ensure policy continuity, said Mumbai-based Anushka Shah, an economist at Citigroup. Fonseka's election pledges suggest he would contain profligacy in public finances and take more conciliatory steps to appease and resettle Tamils, Shah said. Fonseka has resisted the Tamil National Alliance's call for a merger of north and east to avoid alienating the majority Sinhalese community. Tamils make up about 12 percent of the population of more than 20 million. Both men must also deal with war crimes accusations aimed at the army. A United Nations human rights advocate urged an independent investigation of the alleged execution of Tamil Tigers after determining a videotape of the incident is authentic. "

1,"With many investors nervous as March hares, this is a good time to look at stocks with high profits and low debt. I don't expect a double-dip recession, but if one happens, these companies should withstand it better than most. They should also do fine if the economy improves, as I expect. Only 8 percent of U.S. companies with a market value of $250 million or more achieved a return of 25 percent or more on stockholders' equity last year. And only 23 percent of companies have debt less than 10 percent of stockholders' equity. The real trick is meeting both criteria at once. A paltry 2 percent of companies managed the feat last year. The three largest companies that qualify are Apple Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Gap Inc. Of those three, I prefer Gap because it sells for 12 times earnings compared with 23 for Apple and 18 for Mastercard. However, there are smaller stocks I like better. Let's begin with Western Digital Corp. Based in Lake Forest, Calif, Western Digital is the world's No. 2 manufacturer of hard disk drives for personal computers. Seagate Technology, based in the Cayman Islands and run from Scotts Valley, Calif., is No. 1. The two rivals hold more than half the market. Technological obsolescence might threaten the big two some day. Solid state drives or other innovations could someday replace the spinning disks in common use now. For the moment, though, the threat seems distant. Western Digital has been profitable in its past eight fiscal years. Disk makers should benefit from the transition to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 7 as the standard operating system for PCs. Many businesses that normally replace their computers every three years delayed purchases during the recession. Now that the recession seems to be over and Windows 7 is available, I foresee robust spending on new personal computers by both corporations and individuals in 2010 and 2011. Western Digital sells for six times earnings. Next let's look at Wet Seal Inc., an apparel retailer located in Foothill Ranch, Calif. It sells clothing to teenage girls and young women at its Wet Seal stores, and offers women's fashions at its Arden B. line. Wet Seal is debt free, a quality I find alluring. Its current ratio (assets divided by liabilities) is a healthy 3.9. Unlike Western Digital, which has been consistently profitable in recent years, Wet Seal's performance has been erratic. It posted losses every year from 2004 through 2007. Under Chief Executive Officer Edmond Thomas, it seems to have turned around and gotten back onto profitable footing. Never will I rest easy owning shares in a clothing retailer: Fashion is too fickle. But I like Wet Seal's financial strength and its low valuations. The stock sells for four times earnings. Another comeback story is New York-based Loral Space & Communications Inc., which operates a fleet of communications satellites. A predecessor company went bankrupt in 2003, but the current Loral, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005, is debt free and earned a $232 million profit last year on sales of $993 million. Loral lost money in four of the past six years. Disenchanted investors value the stock at less than five times earnings. Disgruntled analysts don't bother to cover it. The stock is covered by one small brokerage firm, which rates it 'hold.' I think Loral is an interesting speculation for a risk-tolerant investor. Also worth considering, though highly controversial, is gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co., located in Southport, Conn. Last year the company earned $27 million on sales of $271 million. It has been profitable every year for at least two decades though earnings have bounced up and down. Only three analysts follow the stock, and all suggest buying it. There is, of course, a moral aspect to this investment. The cities of New York and Washington unsuccessfully sued Sturm Ruger and other gunmakers, alleging that they sell weapons to careless or greedy dealers who allow them to fall into the hands of criminals. The company's defenders say the weapons are used mainly by law-enforcement officers, the military and hunters. Sturm Ruger is debt free and earned a 34 percent return on equity last year. The stock sells for 10 times earnings. Disclosure note: I own Western Digital personally and for clients. I have no long or short positions in the other stocks discussed in this week's column.

1,"The United States and Russia may sign a new nuclear arms reduction agreement in early April, after a previous treaty expired in December, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. 'As we speak, our negotiations in Geneva are wrapping up the final elements of the START treaty,' Clinton said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Moscow. 'We hope to have a signing ceremony between President Medvedev and President Obama in early April.' Clinton later told reporters that only 'technical issues' remain to be resolved. The two governments are trying to agree on the first new treaty in two decades to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and the air and sea vehicles used to deliver them. Presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama called in July for a reduction of the two countries' arsenals to between 1,500 and 1,675 deployed warheads and between 500 and 1,100 missiles, bombers and submarines. The United States is also seeking Russian support for tougher measures at the United Nations to pressure Iran to stop any development of a nuclear weapon and engage in talks on the scope and intent of its nuclear work. Clinton said it is hard to verify if Iran is closer to acquiring a nuclear weapons capability than when President Barack Obama took office last year. 'It's difficult to place timetables or milestones' on how far Iran may have come with clandestine activities, she said in the interview Friday. Asked if a lack of evidence that Iran is close to producing a weapon could undermine international support for sanctions aimed at reining in its nuclear program, Clinton said the sanctions push 'is making progress' and that she had a 'receptive audience' in her meetings with Russian leaders during the past two days. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sanctions 'rarely work, but there are situations in which they become unavoidable.' Such a situation 'could emerge in Iran,' he told reporters Friday. Medvedev said this month that Russia is ready to consider sanctions that wouldn't hurt civilians. During her visit, Clinton urged her Russian hosts to delay plans to bring a nuclear power station into operation in Iran, saying 'we want to send an unequivocal message to the Iranians.' Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the Russian-built Bushehr plant's first reactor may begin work this summer. Clinton pointed to the United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency's recent report that raised questions about Iran's nuclear program. 'Why were they building a secret facility at Qom?' she asked. 'Why would they not accept the joint Russian-French- American proposal' to assist them in getting nuclear fuel for a research reactor that produces medical isotopes. The U.S. is building support for 'a regime of smart sanctions, as President Medvedev has referred to them, that will try to change the behavior of the Iranian leadership,' Clinton told reporters after a meeting with the Russian leader. 'Increasingly, these questions are becoming important for the Chinese to also confront,' she said. China holds a U.N. Security Council permanent seat with veto power and hasn't yet said whether it would go along with more sanctions on Iran, a major supplier of crude oil for its economy. China is growing more concerned about Iran's nuclear intentions, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said this week. While the U.S. focuses on Iran's nuclear work, it is also trying to help democracy activists in Iran whose protests and online organizing have been targets of Iranian security crackdowns. Clinton said the U.S. has issued a license to a company to boost Internet access for Iranians, though the government in Tehran will likely attempt to block U.S. efforts. 'We're doing a lot, let me just put it at that, because we think it is in the interests of American values and American strategic concerns to make sure that people have a chance to know what is going on outside of Iran,' Clinton said. While in Moscow, Clinton joined a meeting of the Quartet on Middle East. The Quartet, made up of the U.S., United Nations, European Union and Russia, said indirect talks are 'an important step' toward resuming direct Israeli- Palestinian talks without preconditions. The Quartet said talks should lead to a settlement within two years and result in the emergence of a 'viable Palestinian state.' With assistance from Lyubov Pronina in Moscow. "
1,"Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, a 13-term Ohio Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives who was chiefly known for his work on housing and addressing the energy crisis of the 1970s, died of melanoma Tuesday at his home in Leland, Mich. He was 87. Ashley _ known colloquially as 'Lud' _ served Ohio's ninth district, which includes Lucas County and the city of Toledo, from 1955 to 1981. As chairman of a House subcommittee on housing and community development, Ashley was a key supporter of legislation to provide federal grants to cities and counties to improve low- and moderate-income housing. 'Americans sleep in better homes today because of Lud Ashley, ' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., once said of Ashley's extensive work on low-income housing legislation. In 1977, Ashley was appointed to an ad hoc energy committee by House Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass., who said he picked Ashley because he had 'toughness, and a never-say-die attitude, and who, when he was put on the first team, could run with the ball.' A year later, Ashley helped the 40-member bipartisan group pass a series of energy bills aimed at reducing the nation's use of oil and increasing the budget for research into alternative energy sources. Upon his appointment to the position, Ashley assured critics that he would not be close to the automobile industry. At the time, Toledo housed the headquarters of many car-parts manufacturers and an American Motors plant that produced Jeeps. 'That district is a part of me,' Ludlow told the New York Times in 1977. 'It is responsible for the perspective I bring with me. But my view is that my district elected me to represent, when called upon, a larger national interest.' Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was born Jan. 11, 1923, in Toledo. His great- grandfather, James Mitchell Ashley, served Ohio's ninth district from 1859 to 1869 as a Republican, having switched from the Democratic Party because he was vehemently opposed to slavery. The elder Ashley co-authored the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery and led the campaign to impeach President Andrew Johnson, who he claimed had conspired to assassinate Abraham Lincoln to assume the presidency. He was also chairman of a committee on territories and helped choose the names for Wyoming and Montana. After Army service in the Pacific during World War II, the younger Ashley graduated from Yale University in 1948. At Yale, he became close friends with George H.W. Bush when they were members of the Skull and Bones secret society. He received a law degree from Ohio State University in 1951 and practiced law for a short time with his father before moving to New York to work for Radio Free Europe. Before losing his House seat in the Reagan landslide of 1980, the only time Ashley had come close to being defeated was in 1974. The race occurred only months after he'd been convicted of drunk driving and resisting arrest in Toledo, and Ashley eked out a victory over his Republican opponent by a margin of 3,500 votes. Ashley directed federal funds toward his district, including more than $15 million for public housing units and $11 million for the improvement of the Port of Toledo. By an act of Congress in recent years, the city's federal courthouse was named in his and his great-grandfather's honor. "
1,"The Obama administration's pay czar on Tuesday announced further pay cuts for top executives at five U.S. firms still receiving substantial help from the federal government, saying the vast majority of cash salaries will remain at $500,000 or less. The rulings by Kenneth Feinberg, the administration's special master for compensation, apply to 119 executives at American International Group, General Motors, Chrysler, GMAC and Chrysler Financial. During a briefing at the Treasury Department, Feinberg said that he would reduce cash payments to the top 25 executives at each of the companies by 33 percent, on average, compared with 2009 levels. He said total 2010 compensation _ which includes company stock _ would also decline. Feinberg's decisions on 2010 compensation mark a continuation of the experiment begun last year, when the government intervened in the pay decisions of companies that received billions of dollars in federal assistance. Appointed in June after months of public outcry over lavish pay at bailed-out firms, Feinberg last fall outlined compensation limits for top earners at the largest aid recipients. Now, as then, the issue of executive pay remains a lightning rod on Capitol Hill and around the country. While some firms have argued that Feinberg's actions put them at risk of losing top talent to competitors, Feinberg said Tuesday that his initial moves to slash top executives' pay had not resulted in an exodus from the bailed-out firms. He cited the fact that more than 80 percent of the executives whose pay he ruled on in October were still with their companies in early 2010. A fair number of executives, however, left the affected companies between the time that Feinberg began his work and the end of last year. Many were driven away by the uncertainty of working for companies closely overseen by Washington and went to work for firms outside Feinberg's purview, their colleagues have said. Feinberg insisted Tuesday that beyond the cash salary cuts, his rulings 'reaffirm' broader principles about compensation set forth during his initial decisions last fall, which sought to create financial incentives for executives to work for the long-term stability of their companies. For instance, Feinberg has ruled that a majority of compensation paid in stock must be held over longer periods of time and cannot be cashed out in the short term. Pay incentives to executives also must be tied to objective performance measures, he said. Feinberg also is broadening his review of financial industry compensation, sending letters to 419 banks that received assistance as part of the Treasury Department's financial rescue program. The 'look back letter' from Feinberg will give companies 30 days to furnish the requested information about executive pay. The review concerns only executives who earned an annualized salary of more than $500,000 during the four-month period between October 2008, when the banks began receiving government support, and February 2009, when his authority granted under last year's stimulus bill took effect. 'If we find there is a compensation decision inconsistent with the public interest, I cannot then file a lawsuit, cannot subpoena records, can't demand an investigation,' Feinberg said Tuesday. 'All I have at my disposal, under law, is the bully pulpit.' The move seems in line with Feinberg's goal of encouraging more prudent pay standards at financial firms. He said he would issue a report on the information culled through the broader review, suggesting that some firms could feel public pressure to return money to taxpayers. Executives at auto lender GMAC, which has received three federal bailouts, received among the strictest rulings from Feinberg on Tuesday. The company's chief executive, Michael Carpenter, will be paid only in stock, and no top executive at the firm will receive a cash salary exceeding $500,000. The company, however, will be able to award up to $12.5 million of stock to employees if they meet performance goals, documents show. Feinberg said Tuesday that he had succeeded in forcing executives at AIG Financial Products, whose faulty derivatives contracts nearly sunk AIG, to hand over the $45 million in retention bonuses they had pledged to return last year. But Feinberg was unable legally to prevent the payout of a much larger chunk of bonuses to Financial Products employees. Instead, he took those payments into consideration when deciding to freeze the 2010 salaries for all but one of the top-earning Financial Products executives, he said. Feinberg singled out new AIG chief executive Robert Benmosche for working closely on the pay issues, saying he 'deserves specific mention and praise.' Benmosche's $10.5 million compensation package _ a mix of stock and cash _ remains among the largest awards approved Tuesday. Feinberg also made exceptions to his $500,000 salary cap for four other AIG executives, according to Treasury documents. While Feinberg clearly scaled back some compensation proposals submitted by the five firms remaining under his watch, he did note that company officials had been 'extremely cooperative, helpful, open, transparent' during recent negotiations. 'I believe they're comfortable with the result,' Feinberg said. 'I certainly hope that's the case.' "
1,"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase's investment bank slashed their compensation in the fourth quarter, responding to political pressure that will probably persist as details of bonuses for their top executives emerge in coming weeks. The three Wall Street firms set aside $39.9 billion for pay in 2009, below the 2007 record of $44.7 billion. The total fell short of the $46.1 billion five analysts expected this month and is almost $10 billion less than what some analysts estimated in October. 'There's no question that Wall Street got the message from Washington,' said Michael Robinson, a senior vice president of Levick Strategic Communications and former head of public affairs at the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'But positioning the big banks with big bonuses as the bad guys has played well for politicians, and they are likely going to keep coming back to it. To some extent, banks a "
1,"Winter hunting season is underway for resident Canada geese, abundant, non- native waterfowl that linger year-round. 'For the love of all that is holy, please eat them,' blogs Jackson Landers, a Virginia hunting instructor, author and guide who promotes harvesting invasive species for food. Resident Canada geese 'represent a tremendous amount of underutilized food,' he writes. The big geese are originally from the Midwest but were shipped to the East Coast in the early 1900s by hunters, who tethered them to the ground as lures for smaller migratory geese. 'That ended in 1935, when it became illegal to use live decoys,' says Larry Hindman of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The decoy birds were released and soon began their population explosion, grazing on and fouling golf courses and suburban lawns, and damaging turf farms and agricultural fields. To help control a population that is twice as large as wildlife managers would prefer, government agencies have adopted more-liberal hunting guidelines. As a result, the resident goose population has been steadily decreasing in rural areas but continues to increase where hunting is not an option. Anyone on the hunt for geese, whether by bow and arrow, shotgun or even their bare hands, must first attend hunter safety classes and get a hunting license. Buying a killed Canada goose is not an option: Unless it comes from a licensed breeder, the sale of waterfowl is illegal. Urban geese are relatively safe from hunters unless they threaten to collide with aircraft. That's when the feds step in and transform a hazard into a harvest. The Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services program donates goose carcasses 'to food banks, large animal rescue/ rehabilitation groups and zoos,' says the USDA's Michael Begier. In 2009, the USDA donated more than a ton of goose flesh in the Maryland- Delaware-Washington area, says the USDA's Carol Bannerman. One recipient, the Maryland Food Bank, distributed 325 pounds of ground goose and goose chubs (stew meat) to food pantries and food kitchens across the state. 'It's a wonderful resource for protein,' says the food bank's Nancy Smith. 'We are absolutely thrilled. Not many people donate protein.' Demand is high. 'This is the first time in 32 years that we've seen middle-class families using food pantries,' she says. Goose meat 'flies off the shelves as soon as it's available.' Some people find goose donations unpalatable. Sharon Pawlak, for the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese, says, 'Donating goose meat to food pantries is nothing more than a public relations ploy to justify the cruel and unnecessary slaughter of so-called nuisance geese.' She also has concerns about feeding potentially toxic meat to people who tend to suffer more health problems than other groups. Eating a goose can pose a health hazard if the bird has been dabbling in polluted waters. Waterfowl can accumulate heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), especially in their fat. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources recommends eating no more than a half-pound of urban goose per week: 'The geese must be trimmed of all fat, either baked or broiled, and no drippings should be used in sauces.' That preparation, the department says, should remove 50 to 80 percent of fat-soluble contaminants. Before releasing goose meat, the USDA tests it for toxins. 'The meat is often distributed widely so that no one family or location would be reliant on this meat,' says Bannerman. Hunters for the Hungry, headquartered in Big Island, Va., doesn't deal with many geese. 'The problem,' spokesman Gary Arrington says, 'is finding processors for the birds. It's just not cost-effective.' But if they do hear of a farmer or golf course with a permit to eliminate a flock, they recommend direct donations to soup kitchens, churches or food pantries that are able to prepare a few freshly killed birds. 'Killing an animal is always a sad thing,' says harvesting advocate Landers, 'but eating it at least gives the act some real point and meaning.'

1,"Matt Cain didn't allow a hit into the eighth inning, pitching the San Francisco Giants past the fading Colorado Rockies 4-2 on Sunday and back into first place in the National League West. San Francisco moved a half-game ahead of San Diego, which lost to Cincinnati. The Rockies, who have dropped six of seven, fell 4 1/2 games behind the Giants and four back of the Padres in the wild-card race. Cain (13-10) held the Rockies hitless until speedy Jay Payton legged out an infield single with one out in the eighth. Pinch-hitter Melvin Mora connected for a two-run homer, ending Cain's scoreless streak at 20 innings. Still, the right-hander went the distance on a three-hitter for his 12th career complete game and fourth this season. He won his fourth straight start and hasn't lost in seven outings since Aug. 18. Freddy Sanchez homered off Jorge De La Rosa (8-6), and Cody Ross also went deep for the Giants. Reds 12, Padres 2 At San Diego, Chris Heisey homered and hit a three-run double to lead Cincinnati to a romp over San Diego that reduced its magic number to one for winning the NL Central. Joey Votto and Brandon Phillips also homered for the Reds, denied a chance to clinch the division title Sunday when St. Louis beat the Chicago Cubs. Cincinnati is off Monday and then opens a three-game series at home Tuesday night against Houston. San Diego's loss ensured a playoff spot for the Philadelphia Phillies, who need one win or an Atlanta defeat to wrap up the NL East crown. Adrian Gonzalez hit his 30th homer for the Padres and finished with three hits. Clayton Richard (13-9) allowed six runs and five hits in five-plus innings. Mets 7, Phillies 3 At Philadelphia, Carlos Beltran hit a pair of homers and David Wright also connected as New York prevented Philadelphia from clinching their fourth straight NL East title at home. The two-time defending NL champions came in needing a win and a loss by Atlanta to secure the division crown. The Braves lost to Washington, dropping Philadelphia's magic number to one. Chase Utley hit a three-run homer for the Phillies, who will finish the season on the road with three games at Washington and three at Atlanta. Nationals 4, Braves 2 At Washington, Atlanta's drive for the NL wild card spun its wheels again, with wild pitchers and missed opportunities at the plate contributing to a loss to last-place Washington. Every Nationals player who scored got on base with a walk, the last two runs coming on Ian Desmond's tiebreaking single in the seventh that followed three straight free passes from the Braves bullpen. The Nationals took two of three from the Braves in the series. Atlanta has lost five of six. Cardinals 8, Cubs 7 At Chicago, Albert Pujols hit his league-leading 42nd home run as St. Louis held off Chicago to prevent the Reds from clinching the NL Central title. Pujols hit a three-run homer and Matt Pagnozzi drove in three runs as the Cardinals took an 8-0 lead in the fifth. The Cubs finished 35-46 at Wrigley Field this season. Jake Westbrook (3-4) pitched 5 1-3 innings and allowed three earned runs. Ryan Franklin got five outs for his 26th save in 28 opportunities. Pirates 9, Astros 3 At Pittsburgh, Paul Maholm limited Houston to one run over seven innings to win consecutive starts for the first time all season as Pittsburgh turned catcher Jason Castro's throwing error into its first two runs. Maholm (9-15) avoided adding to his NL-leading loss total, permitting Carlos Lee's two-out RBI double in the first before shutting out the Astros over the next six innings. Neil Walker drove in three runs as the Pirates scored three times in the seventh and four in the eighth against Houston's bullpen. Hunter Pence hit his 25th homer for the Astros. Brewers 7, Marlins 1 At Milwaukee, Ryan Braun hit two of Milwaukee's four home runs and Chris Capuano pitched six sharp innings before leaving with an injury in Milwaukee's victory over Florida. Capuano (4-4) limited the Marlins to one run and four hits. He came out to start the seventh, but left the mound after a couple of warmup tosses because of a strained left groin. Braun hit a pair of two-run homers and Prince Fielder and Lorenzo Cain also connected for Milwaukee. Braun homered off Adalberto Mendez (1-2) in the first and third, reaching 25 homers and becoming the third Brewers player with 100 RBIs in three straight seasons. Fielder followed Braun's second shot with his 32nd home run. Diamondbacks 5, Dodgers 4 At Phoenix, Chris Young and Tony Abreu each hit a two-run homer in a four-run eighth inning to rally Arizona past Los Angeles. The comeback spoiled a 13-strikeout effort from Dodgers starter Chad Billingsley, who tied a career high. George Sherrill allowed Abreu's homer, his first of the season, to cut the lead to one. Two batters later, Young hammered the first pitch from Jonathan Broxton (5-6) to put the Diamondbacks ahead in their final home game of the season. James Loney hit a two-run double and Rod Barajas had a two-run homer for Los Angeles. "
1,"German discount supermarket chain Aldi says Theo Albrecht, its co-founder and considered one of the country's richest men, has died. He was 88. The company's Aldi Nord division said Wednesday that Albrecht died in his home city of Essen on Saturday. It didn't give a cause of death. Albrecht and his elder brother Karl went into the retail business after World War II and the first Aldi stores opened in the 1960s. Aldi now has more than 4,000 outlets in Germany alone and has stores across Europe and beyond. The publicity-shy Albrecht brothers have regularly led lists of Germany's richest people. "
1,"No matter how much Democrats scream about GOP obstructionism, the jury is still out on whether Republicans will take any blame for its consequences. Democrats run Congress, and the public may tune out arguments over Senate procedure as Beltway noise. On Thursday, Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a $30 billion fund to enable community banks to boost lending to small businesses. Republicans decried the move as another bailout. It is unlikely the bill will pass before the August congressional recess. How will this story play? Take, for example, the Associated Press's account, which noted that the GOP blocked the bill but summed up the standoff's significance this way: 'Congressional Democrats started the year with ambitious plans to pass a series of bills designed to create jobs. But if negotiations on the small business lending bill fail, they will have little to show for it just a few months before midterm elections that will determine whether Democrats keep their majorities in the House and Senate.' Is this how the story will be understood by the American people? Quite possibly. Republican lawmakers claimed that Democrats blocked votes on the amendments the GOP wanted. Democrats countered that they agreed to votes on the GOP amendments only to have the Republicans demand more votes. In other words: The larger story is getting subsumed in a bunch of Beltway bickering and white noise. So what story line will the American people take away from all this? Whatever their substantive objections to this bill, it appears that Republicans have calculated that the failure of Democratic legislation, and Democratic griping about the Republican role in blocking such legislation, will feed a sense that government is broken and/or has failed to deliver. The GOP is betting that the failure and the griping will reflect badly on the ruling party. And if that AP paragraph captures the way the story line is understood by the American people, Democrats are in serious trouble.

1,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, a lightning rod for anger over Wall Street bailouts, is expected to overcome Senate opposition and win a second term as head of the U.S. central bank. The Senate has scheduled a key vote Thursday that will determine whether Bernanke has at least 60 senators on his side to beat a filibuster aimed at blocking his reappointment. Senate leaders from both parties expressed confidence he would prevail. Still, the vote could be the slimmest for a Federal Reserve nominee, eclipsing opposition to Paul Volcker in 1983 when he was confirmed for a second term by a vote of 84-16. No Fed chairman has been rejected by the Senate. The stock market has been rooting for Bernanke. The Dow Jones Industrial average plunged last week amid news of mounting opposition, then recovered when his prospects brightened. The Federal Reserve wields enormous power over American pocketbooks. It has the power to set interest rates that influence economic activity, employment and inflation. And it help maintain economic stability by making emergency loans to banks when they can't get cash elsewhere. 'I believe that the chairman is going to be confirmed by a bipartisan vote,' Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. Widely credited for avoiding a financial catastrophe, Bernanke has angered the public and lawmakers over his support of Wall Street bailouts -- especially the $182 billion rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc. The criticism has mounted as unemployment has risen to double digits and bankers paid out bonuses. Critics also blame him for not detecting the coming crisis and failing to rein in the banking industry. 'He was asleep at the switch while Wall Street became a gambling casino,' said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is among the senators in opposition. The biggest challenge facing the Fed this year will be how and when to reverse course and raise rates. To foster the recovery, the Fed on Wednesday kept interest rates at a record low and pledged to hold them there for some time. Though Bernanke may get 60 or more votes to overcome Republican procedural blocking, his support on the final confirmation vote will likely be smaller. Several senators have said they would oppose blocking a vote on his confirmation but would vote against his reappointment. Sanders stopped short of conceding that Bernanke would win the vote, but he said the close tally would send a message to President Barack Obama. The confirmation fight and the attacks on the Fed have become a test of central bank independence. The Fed jealously guards its autonomy as a crucial element for carrying out monetary policy, even if it isn't popular with politicians. Bernanke, 56, was first tapped by President George W. Bush to run the nation's central bank. Obama picked him for a second term in August. His term expires on Jan. 31. Most of his professional career was in academia. He spent 17 years teaching economics at Princeton. Bernanke came to Washington to take a job at the Federal Reserve, working with then-Chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush selected him to be his top economist. After that he went on to run the Fed, starting in 2006. "
1,"LONDON -- A wealthy young teenager buried near Britain's mysterious Stonehenge monument came from the Mediterranean hundreds of miles away, scientists said Wednesday, proof of the site's importance as a travel destination in prehistoric times. The teen -- dubbed 'The Boy with the Amber Necklace' because he was unearthed with a cluster of amber beads around his neck -- is one of several sets of foreign remains found around the ancient ring of imposing stones, whose exact purpose remains unknown. The British Geological Survey's Jane Evans said that the find, radiocarbon dated to 1,550 B.C., 'highlights the diversity of people who came to Stonehenge from across Europe,' a statement backed by Bournemouth University's Timothy Darvill, a Stonehenge scholar uninvolved with the discovery. 'The find adds considerable weight to the idea that people traveled long distances to visit Stonehenge, which must therefore have had a big reputation as a cult center,' Darvill said in an e-mail Wednesday. 'Long distance travel was certainly more common at this time than we generally think.' The skeleton, thought to be that of a 14- or 15-year-old, was unearthed about two miles (3 kilometers) southeast of Stonehenge, in southern England. Clues to the adolescent's foreign origins could be found in the necklace, which isn't a recognized British type. But he was traced to the area around the Mediterranean Sea by a technique known as isotope analysis, which in this case measured the ratio of strontium and oxygen isotopes in his tooth enamel. Different regions have different mixes of elements in their drinking water, for example, and some of those are absorbed into a person's tooth enamel as he or she grows up. Analysis of the isotopes of oxygen and strontium carried in the enamel can give scientists a good but rather general idea of where a person was raised. The teen, whose necklace suggests he came from a rich family, is one of several long-distance travelers found near Stonehenge. The 'Amesbury Archer,' so-called because of the stone arrowheads he was found with, was buried three miles (5 kilometers) from Stonehenge but is thought to have from the Alpine foothills of central Europe. The 'Boscombe Bowmen,' also found nearby, are thought to have come from Wales or possibly Brittany. It isn't clear precisely what drew these people to Stonehenge, a site which has existed in various forms for some 5,000 years. It clearly had an important ceremonial function, and the area around it is dotted with the remains of prehistoric monuments and tombs. Some say it was at the center of a sun-worshipping culture or that it served as a kind of astronomical calendar. Others, like Darvill, also say it might have been an important healing site, drawing pilgrims from across Europe like a prehistoric version of Lourdes. ------ Online: Stonehenge: "
1,"Lawyers representing a pregnant woman jailed for life in Laos for trafficking heroin say she's appealing her conviction. Twenty-year-old Samantha Orobator was allowed to return to Britain this month to serve out her jail term. Heroin trafficking is punishable by death in Laos, but Orobator was spared because the law does not allow the execution of pregnant women. Lawyer Rhona Friedman said Wednesday that Orobator has filed an appeal with Britain's Appeal Court. Friedman says Orobator was not given a fair trial in Laos. Police in Laos claimed to have found 1.5 pounds (680 grams) of heroin on Orobator's body when she was arrested in August 2008. "
1,"House prices in Britain rose by 1.6 percent in August, slowing the annual fall in prices as low interest rates helped support the market, a major mortgage lender said Thursday. The Nationwide Building Society, the nation's No. 3 mortgage lender, said that August's gain left the average house price 2.7 percent lower than a year ago. That was a substantial improvement on July, when prices rose 1.4 percent to put the annual price drop at 6.2 percent. However, Nationwide warned that interest rates would not remain at the current record low of 0.5 percent indefinitely as inflationary pressures begin to revive along with economic growth. The building society said that subsequent rising interest rates would probably have the effect of releasing additional supply back onto the market and dampening the recent rise in buyer interest. 'Under such conditions, the strong price increases of recent months would become difficult to sustain,' it said, while noting that a rise in interest rates 'is probably still some way off.' "

A deal signed Wednesday also makes Bosco Sport the exclusive outfitter of Russian Olympic teams for the upcoming Winter Games in Vancouver through the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Sochi organizing committee chairman Dmitry Chernyshenko signed the tier one sponsorship deal worth more than $100 million with Mikhail Kusnirovich, the head of Bosco Sport's parent company. Bosco Sport also signed a deal to produce licensed apparel with the Olympic symbols through 2016. Russian organizers said earlier this month that they expect to attract more than $1 billion in revenues from domestic sponsors of the Sochi Games. "
1,"New York continues through its second 'golden age of cocktails,' which involves patrons consuming tiny (albeit excellent) potables with two ounces of alcohol in super-serious drink dens where there's no standing, smoking, canoodling or fighting. So when I heard that a version of Long Island iced tea (an industrial-strength mix of gin, vodka, rum, Triple Sec, tequila and cola) was being served at Ma Peche, the new midtown outpost of David Chang's downtown Momofuku empire, I got my hopes up. Maybe the drinks of yesteryear could be tweaked, if not necessarily tempered, by adventurous bartenders looking to pair their extra-strong libations with high- quality (not hangover) food. Another example? How about Tea for the Wry Duke? Cost: $17 at Tudor City's Convivio. A waitress approaches your table with an iced bottle of Potocki vodka. She pours the spirit until your stem is full. No shaking. No stirring. No dilution. What's it garnished with? Nothing. Six ounces of alcohol. That's about three times as strong as a typical cocktail. Very 'Mad Men.' Trans-Atlantic imbibers will recognize this ritual from Duke's bar in London. Here the Brit sensation is achieved by first rinsing the glass with bergamot-infused vermouth. So the Duke smells like Earl Grey tea, tastes like a glacier. If a regular martini magically renders a strong spirit smooth via a marriage of ice and vermouth, the deep freeze here takes the edge off. And then the vodka warms up on the tongue, heating the esophagus with a cool burn. The chill gives the drink a heavy, viscous texture, letting it stand up to fried pig's head, and fortifying a diner's constitution between bites of fusilli with pork ragu and caciocavallo cheese fondue. In Russia, you chase a shot of vodka with something pickled to revive the senses. At Convivio, it's the opposite. Chef Michael White's food is so rich that the martini functions like smelling salts, the alcohol preventing a food hangover. It's perfect. Brian Miller, who tends bar at Death & Company in the East Village, deserves some credit for bringing Tiki concoctions back from the realm of frat party cocktails to their rightful post as high-end drinks, some of which, when made right, seem to cause hallucinations or partial paralysis. Take his Zombie ($16). If a daiquiri got a julep pregnant while dropping acid in a former French Polynesian nuclear site, their atomic love child would be a Zombie. There's dark rum, golden rum, absinthe, grenadine, lime juice, bitters, velvet falernum, El Dorado 151 rum (better than Bacardi) and a sprig of mint, all served over crushed ice. Four and a half ounces of action-packed alcohol. The experience? Like a crazy wine: grassy on the nose. Fruit, anise, tannins on the palate. And a biting caramel finish. Miller says it's from a 1934 recipe by Hollywood legend Don the Beachcomber. Don would limit patrons to two. I had three. That included Miller's gin Zombie (The Winchester, $16), a tart, more balanced drink that can be accidentally consumed in 10 minutes. Then I had Phil Ward's tequila Zombie down the block at Mayahuel. Ward calls it the Old Man Miller Swizzle. He supplements the high-proof rum with a dose of reposado and mezcal (the smoky Scotch of tequilas). The heavy, tongue coating mouthfeel is the right pairing for robust mole-braised chicken tamales. I regained control of my speech 12 hours later. The Short Island iced tea at Ma Peche is Chang's way of saying that even though he's now uptown and classy and has backs on his seats, he can still roll with the lawn chair crowd. Welcome to the Chambers Hotel. Typically, this Amy Fisher of cocktails is supposed to mimic a real iced tea because when you're bombed, you have no sense of taste and are easily persuaded by the cola's sweetness. I'm tempted to call Ma Peche's version the best one out there, as it's actually made with decent booze: Plymouth gin, Herradura tequila, Tito's vodka, Cointreau and Flor De Cana rum. But remember, we're painting a face on a dog's rear end, so the superlative might not be in order. Use the included lemon wedge to cut the sugar. Pair it with the Michelin-worthy riff on frisee aux lardons, served here with guanciale croutons and spicy tripe. As it turns out, the Short Island has just 2.5 ounces of booze. I'll have a double. "
1,"The prototype of the first computer mouse _ which got its name because of the wire that trailed it _ was invented by Doug Engelbart in 1963. Yes, nearly 50 years ago. But it's only a toddler compared with the keyboard, which is a direct descendant _ via punch-card and teletype technologies _ of the typewriter, patented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. In other words, it's long past time for a change in the way we interact with the digital devices that have proliferated in our lives. While the keyboard and the mouse have introduced billions of people to the digital experience, they have become antiquated obstacles to the kind of computing that is now emerging. This new computing is immersive, augmented and completely social. As sci-fi movies predicted, our digital devices are poised to become even more ubiquitous. They will surround us, responding to our expressions, emotions and gestures. From wearable devices to sensors that will envelop our world to 3-D screens that will react to us, personal computing is about to get a lot more personal. Internet-based television now in development will recognize a viewer and deliver customized entertainment. And it will do this without the trusty keyboard and mouse. We're already phasing them out, thanks to the increasing popularity of touch screens _ including the patron saint of all this, the Apple iPhone, and a spate of copycat smartphones. All of these devices allow users to navigate without physical buttons or input devices. Thus, with a flick of the finger, the era of the mouse and the keyboard will soon be over. _ Swisher is co-executive editor of the technology website All Things Digital. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Half of the 21 drugs pulled from the market for safety reasons since 1995 involved heart complications, a finding that is spurring Congress and doctors to call for closer government review of side effects. The products were on the market from 11 months to 30 years, based on a review of Food and Drug Administration data obtained by Bloomberg. GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes drug Avandia, marketed for 11 years, narrowly avoided a recall last week when the FDA restricted its use as a result of a link to heart ailments only uncovered after the drug was in wide use. The agency is now reviewing heart risks for Abbott Laboratories' diet pill Meridia, sold since 1997. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the data supports his recommendation to create an FDA center that would independently study drug safety, saying early warnings within the agency are now sometimes ignored. Doctors say heart risks can best be found in large controlled studies before or after a drug is released, as opposed to an FDA system that depends largely on voluntary reports from doctors and patients. 'The question is whether there are more drugs that should be on the list, and are not,' Grassley said in a statement, after he was supplied with the recall data. Grassley is working with Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., on a bill to create the new FDA center. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the agency has already instituted new safety tests to weigh possible heart risks in the case of drugs, such as Avandia, that are used over a long period of time for chronic conditions. 'It's an ongoing process,' she said in a telephone interview. Woodcock pointed to studies now required with most new drugs to determine the effect on the heart's electrical system. The guidelines were issued in 2005 after drugs were withdrawn in the 1990s because they caused dangerous changes to heart rhythm. It 'doesn't make sense' to test all drugs for heart risks in large controlled studies, Woodcock said. Some drugs are taken for only a short time and others are more likely to cause negative effects on other body systems because of how they work, she said. The Grassley-DeLauro bill would separate the safety reviewers in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology to reduce clashes with the Office of New Drugs, which is responsible for deciding which products to approve and when changes are needed to medicines that are already on the market. It's hard to tell if a heart attack or stroke is caused by a medicine without strictly monitoring patients, said Alastair Wood, a drug-safety expert who spent almost 30 years as medical professor at Vanderbilt University. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 831,272 people dying from that cause in 2006, or one in every three deaths, according to the American Heart Association. 'It's virtually impossible to detect CV problems, like heart attacks, in a spontaneous reporting system where there is no control,' said Wood, now a managing director at Symphony Capital in New York, in a telephone interview. 'If you see six patients with a heart attack on the same drug, it means nothing.' Avandia concerns prompted the FDA in December 2008 to ask companies for more heart data from new diabetes medicines. Drugs submitted for approval must be able to rule out an 80 percent increased risk of cardiovascular side effects in clinical trials. Drugmakers should conduct additional testing after their products are on the market when an increased risk of 30 percent to 80 percent can't be eliminated. 'If you were to require cardiac outcomes studies on every type of drug that comes along, I'm afraid it would basically grind the system to a halt,' said Ira Loss, an analyst at Washington Analysis who has followed the FDA for three decades. 'Companies wouldn't want to make investments,' he said. The drugs recalled since 1995 because of heart risks include Roche Holdings blood-pressure treatment Posicor in 1998, Johnson & Johnson's antihistamine Hismanal in 1999, and Merck & Co.'s painkiller Vioxx in 2004. The average time to recall was eight years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Avandia, once the world's best-selling diabetes drug, was linked to a 43 percent higher risk of heart attacks in an analysis released in 2007, eight years after its approval. Glaxo, of London, said last week that it would stop promoting the drug as a result of new FDA restrictions and European regulators' decision to withdraw the product completely. Meridia, a 13-year-old diet pill, was tied to 16 percent more major cardiovascular complications in a six-year study of 10,000 patients released this month. Abbott Park, Ill.-based Abbott no longer promotes the drug in the U.S. One reason for having a separate drug-safety center is that there are often disagreements between the offices now under Woodcock's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The Office of Surveillance has been prevented from acting on safety concerns because it is 'under the thumb of the office that put the drug on the market in the first place,' Grassley said. David Graham, a reviewer in the surveillance office and 26- year veteran of the FDA, told Congress of Meridia's risks in 2004 while calling for a recall of Vioxx. Graham also urged Avandia to be pulled at a 2007 FDA advisory panel meeting. The head of the surveillance office, Gerald Dal Pan, said in documents released by the FDA last week he still believes the diabetes drug should be withdrawn from the market. John Jenkins, head of the Office of New Drugs, recommended against any restrictions to Avandia or changes to its prescribing information during the FDA's review, the agency's documents show. "
1,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has sought to dampen speculation that her finance minister may leave the government. Media speculation about Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's future has swirled over the past week -- fueled by his spokesman's resignation after a public dressing-down by the minister. That followed a multi-week hospital stay -- Schaeuble's second this year -- for treatment to a wound related to his disability. The daily Handelsblatt reported Friday, without citing named sources, that plans are afoot for a reshuffle and that Schaeuble is expected to go. Merkel told ARD television that 'there's no need to talk further about fabrications.' She said she worked well with Schaeuble at the Group of 20 summit and intends to continue doing so. "
1,"Royal Ahold NV, the Dutch owner of the Stop & Shop and Giant supermarkets in the United States, reported a 4.4 fall in third quarter earnings Thursday, due to higher taxes, even as sales and operating profits grew. The company reported net profit of (EURO)233 million ($315 million), down from (EURO)244 million. Ahold was no longer able to claim tax benefits from previous losses and paid (EURO)49 million in taxes this quarter, up from just (EURO)1 million in the same period a year ago. Ahold said operating profit was up 7.5 percent to (EURO)285 million and sales rose 11 percent to (EURO)6.69 billion, boosted by acquisitions and a relatively strong dollar. Chief Executive John Rishton said business conditions remain tough but his company 'delivered another quarter of solid results,' winning market share. Sales at U.S. stores owned in both quarters rose 1 percent -- not great, but better than big competitors like Wal-Mart, whose same-store sales have fallen amid price wars. Ahold's U.S. margins dipped to 3.7 percent of sales from 4.6 percent. In the Netherlands, where Ahold operates the dominant Albert Heijn chain, same store sales rose 4.5 percent and margins improved a hair to 7 percent from 6.9 percent. Ahold said it used some of its cash-flow to pay down debt this quarter, and net debt now stands at (EURO)846 million, from (EURO)938 million at July 18. "
1,"British banks should be forced to disclose the number of employees who earn more than 1 million pounds ($1.65 million) a year, a government-commissioned review of corporate governance in banks said Thursday. The report from David Walker, former chairman of Morgan Stanley International, proposed other measures to rein in risky activities at banks. It recommended strengthening the role of non-executives to give them new responsibilities to assess risk and payment and said active investors should sign up to stewardship duty so that they can play a more active role as owners of businesses. 'Institutional investors should be less passive and prepared to engage earlier if they suspect weaknesses in governance,' Walker said in the report. 'Early preventive medicine through shareholder engagement can save everyone substantial time and money later on.' Walker said during the financial crisis there was a narrow focus on pay received by banks' executive board members -- but bank owners knew little about cash paid out to the much larger number of high-earning non-executives. 'My proposals will provide much greater information to owners (of banks) to say, 'Hang on a minute, why are you paying so many people so much money?'' he told the BBC. He said he believed there were well over a thousand people earning more than 1 million pounds a year in London's banks and financial institutions. The report also recommended that two-thirds of cash bonuses should be deferred and that at least half of variable pay or bonuses should be paid in the form of a long-term incentive scheme. The report was commissioned by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in February. -------- On the Net: The Walker Review is available at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/walker(underscore)review(underscor )in formation.htm "
1,"In her moment of utter humiliation, exposed on videotape by a journalistic impersonator, Sarah Ferguson didn't blame the press. That's a rarity these days. The Duchess of York could have railed against the lying media after a News of the World reporter posed as a businessman brandishing $40,000 in cash, a down payment for Ferguson's promise to introduce him to her ex-husband, Prince Andrew. Instead, she apologized for her clumsy attempt at influence-peddling. But other public figures keep trying to shift the blame from their own missteps to the news outlets that report on them _ a time-honored tactic designed mainly to get them off the hook. Rand Paul, the GOP Senate nominee in Kentucky, spent nearly 20 minutes with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow talking about his objections to the part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that affects private businesses. Maddow is an unabashed liberal who was taking on a 'tea party' champion, but she gave her guest one opportunity after another to explain his position, with minimal interruption. Even when Maddow asked 'how about desegregating lunch counters?' Paul offered philosophical musings rather than flatly backing a concept that has been settled law in this country for nearly half a century: 'Well, what it gets into is, is that then if you decide that restaurants are publicly owned and not privately owned, then do you say that you should have the right to bring your gun into a restaurant, even though the owner of the restaurant says, `Well, no, we don't want to have guns in here'?' When Paul talked to conservative radio host Laura Ingraham the next day _ and issued a statement backing off his position _ he accused Maddow of 'wanting to make this an issue of you supporting abhorrent practices, which I don't support. ... They conflate things, want to say, `Oh, you believe in beating up people that were trying to eat in restaurants in the 1960s.' ... She went on and on about that.' Paul later told WHAS-TV that he had been 'tortured' by Maddow, though he conceded the interview had been fair. And fed up with the mainstream media, he soon canceled an interview on 'Meet the Press.' Sarah Palin picked up the theme on 'Fox News Sunday,' saying Paul had run into 'a media personality who has an agenda, who may be prejudiced. ... They're looking for that `gotcha' moment.' Leaving aside that her own network employs people who are just as ideologically committed, the lengthy Maddow interview was the opposite of 'gotcha' _ and, in fact, Paul had made essentially the same point to the Louisville Courier-Journal a month earlier. (Most of the national press just missed it.) It's true, though, that MSNBC jumped on the story and drove it for days, as Fox sometimes does with controversies involving liberals. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal refrained from launching a frontal attack on the New York Times after the newspaper revealed that he had not served in Vietnam, as he had claimed on numerous occasions. But Blumenthal made clear that he felt the media were taking 'a few misplaced words' and using them to 'impugn my record of service to our country.' The so-called misplaced words, however, amounted to outright deception when the Democratic Senate candidate said, for example, that 'I wore the uniform in Vietnam.' Blumenthal also said he 'can't be held responsible for all the mistakes in all the articles' about him, although his staff could easily have asked for corrections. Nearly a week after the initial Times article, Blumenthal finally told the Hartford Courant he had 'made mistakes and I am sorry.' The Times reporting had flaws. The paper should have acknowledged that Blumenthal's Republican opponent, former wrestling executive Linda McMahon, had provided some of the negative information, as she was happy to boast once the piece was published. Readers deserved to know the source of some of the opposition research. And the Times should have posted the full video of an instance in which Blumenthal said he had served in Vietnam, which included an earlier _ but not contradictory _ reference to having served during Vietnam. On balance, though, the article was accurate. Fox's Sean Hannity, while interviewing McMahon, said he is 'always suspicious when the New York Times breaks a story on a Democrat because they don't do that very often.' Perhaps he missed the paper's reporting that prompted Eliot Spitzer to resign and his successor, David Paterson, to withdraw from the governor's race. In the recent London sting, Fergie was caught so red-handed by the News of the World's 'Fake Sheik' that she made no attempt to spin her way out of the mess. (She'll seek forgiveness on Oprah's couch this week.) But the British media have largely given Rupert Murdoch's tabloid a pass for engaging in deceit, saying that nailing a minor royal and ex-Weight Watchers spokeswoman was worth it. But where is it written that journalists get to decide when to give themselves permission to lie? If it's all right to pose as a businessman, what about a doctor? A lawyer? A soldier? (Most American news organizations now avoid the practice, immortalized when the Chicago Sun-Times set up a bribe-dispensing bar in 1977, although some television programs still do hidden-camera investigations.) Those who say the ends justify the means sometimes adjust their views depending on the target. When conservative activists James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles posed as pimp and prostitute while secretly taping ACORN staffers, commentators on the right praised them as heroes and liberals challenged their tactics. (O'Keefe pleaded guilty last week to unlawfully entering the office of Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., during another ruse.) The Brits have had a bloody good time mocking Fergie. But the reaction was very different a week earlier when the Mail on Sunday reported that Lord Triesman, chairman of the Football Association, had accused Spain and Russia of planning to bribe referees in this summer's World Cup. The paper got that story from a secretly recorded conversation that the 66-year-old Triesman had with a 37-year- old former aide who claims they had an affair. The Mail was besieged by criticism as Triesman resigned. Former soccer star Gary Lineker quit his column at the paper, saying that 'the Mail on Sunday has made a gross error in judgment in treating Lord Triesman like this.' The reason so many were kicking the tabloid: The sting was blamed for jeopardizing Britain's bid for the 2018 World Cup. "
1,"Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Friday the most restrictive immigration bill in the country, setting the stage for a showdown with the Obama administration and reigniting an explosive national debate less than seven months before congressional midterm elections. Brewer, a Republican facing a stiff primary challenge, said Washington's failure to address the issue had effectively left border protection to the states, forcing her hand. 'We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington act,' she said, her remarks carried live on CNN as hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside her Phoenix office. 'But decades of federal inaction and misguided policy have created an unacceptable situation.' Even before it was signed, President Barack Obama criticized the Arizona law, which requires police to question anyone who appears to be in the country illegally. Obama called the effort 'misguided' and directed the Justice Department to monitor its implementation, warning that it could violate citizens' civil rights. Obama cited the measure as a sign that Congress must act swiftly on overhauling immigration, the subject of bipartisan talks that have stalled recently. 'Failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others,' he said. With the stroke of a pen, Brewer unleashed the passions of activists and politicians on both sides of the issue. Hispanics across the country, who form a key political bloc, threatened an energetic push to elect Democrats in November. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., an advocate of immigration reform, issued a statement describing the law as 'harsh.' The response among national Republicans was more muted, reflecting a split over whether to pursue stricter immigration laws or to court the expanding pool of immigrant voters. Under the new law, to take effect in 90 days, it will be a state crime to be in the country illegally, and legal migrants must carry at all times paperwork proving their legal status. Arizona police will generally be required to question anyone they 'reasonably suspect' of being undocumented _ a vaguely defined and legally untested provision that critics argue will lead to racial profiling, but that supporters insist will give authorities the flexibility to enforce existing immigration laws. Obama, appearing in the Rose Garden, voiced opposition for the first time to the bill hours before it became law. Speaking at a naturalization ceremony for two dozen foreign-born members of the U.S. military, he urged the country to 'choose a different future' than the one advanced in Arizona. Although he said the Justice Department would 'closely monitor' developments, Obama stopped short of demanding immediate intervention. Swift legal challenges are expected from outside groups. Joining Obama at the Rose Garden event was Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who, during two terms as Arizona's Democratic governor, vetoed similar bills repeatedly. She said she did so because 'they would have diverted critical law enforcement resources from the most serious threats to public safety.' Events on Friday underscored Arizona's role as a roiling cauldron of immigration politics: Brewer replaced Napolitano and is now running for a full term. State Treasurer Dean Martin, who is considered Brewer's biggest threat in the Aug. 24 Republican primary, had urged her to sign the bill. Sen. John McCain, in his own tough Republican primary for re-election, only recently came out in support of the bill _ and, on Friday, did not issue a statement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., having concluded that talks to advance a bipartisan bill were stalled, has told Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that if they cannot strike a deal within three weeks, Democrats will bring their own bill forward, aides and lobbyists said. Many lawmakers on both sides, familiar with how treacherous immigration reform proved when President George W. Bush sought it and failed, say they are uncertain about its prospects. Some Democrats have calculated that even if an immigration bill fails, a debate on it could rally their base and mobilize Hispanic voters against GOP lawmakers in some districts. The Arizona bill has also provided Democrats the opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive nationally. The legislation makes Arizona the first state to criminalize illegal immigration by defining unlawful presence as trespassing, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. Between 2007 and 2009, California, Colorado and Texas considered similar proposals but killed them. However, frustration in the states continues to drive legislatures to pass a patchwork of laws each year, some cracking down on illegal immigrants and others seeking to prevent exploitation of them by human traffickers and unscrupulous employers. NCSL estimates that about 1,400 bills are introduced each year. 'There's a huge concern, and states have been down this path before, where they have been taken to court and that has been very costly. ... This will be very much a wait-and-see approach,' said Ann Morse, director of the NSCL immigration policy project. Staff writers Jerry Markon, Marty Weil, Chris Cillizza and Ben Pershing contributed to this report. "
1,"A British jury has convicted a man who planned to attack people he considered 'non-British' of terrorist offenses. The jury at London's Central Criminal Court found 43-year-old Neil Lewington guilty Wednesday of having explosives with intent to endanger life and preparing for acts of terrorism. Prosecutor Brian Altman told the jury Lewington had extreme views on race and ethnicity and planned to attack 'those he considered non-British.' Lewington was arrested in October after an argument with a train conductor. Police found two firebombs in his bag. At his home, they found a notebook labeled 'Waffen SS U.K. members handbook,' along with bomb-making equipment including electrical timers. Lewington will be sentenced later. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Congress returned Monday to a tumultuous political landscape, with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., conceding to a top demand of the tea party movement by endorsing a ban on earmarks. McConnell, a master of purveying federal pork for his home state of Kentucky, had stood firm in his defense of the practice. But an insurgent group of conservatives led by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., had rallied enough senators to defeat McConnell if the issue came to a vote. With just two GOP senators on the record in support of the McConnell's position, the minority leader announced his reversal on the Senate floor moments after the chamber was gaveled into session following the midterm election break. Although the Senate GOP ban on earmarks is nonbinding, McConnell's commitment to ending the designation of federal funding for pet projects illustrates the tremendous pressure incumbents in both parties are under to surrender some of the privileges of office in the aftermath of a voter uproar on Nov. 2. 'I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state. I don't apologize for them,' said McConnell, whose earmark tally in recent years approaches $1 billion, according to the government watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. 'But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight.' Meanwhile, Senate Democrats made their own concession to the new political reality by elevating the party's most combative spokesman, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to a new leadership role. He will be in charge of a messaging and rapid- response team that will push back against Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced the addition of freshman Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, to his leadership team, responding to a call by junior lawmakers for a greater voice in decision-making. Senate Democrats and Republicans are scheduled to meet Tuesday to vote on party leaders for the next Congress, while House Democrats and Republicans will hold their leadership elections Wednesday. Although Democrats still control the House and Senate for the rest of the year, party leaders have started adjusting to the idea of the coming divided Congress and a more conservative Republican opposition. Democrats will face pressure to make room for Republican views on issues such as taxes and spending, two matters that will dominate the lame-duck session. President Barack Obama has already signaled that he is open to a compromise that would extend income tax cuts even for high earners to prevent an across-the- board tax increase on Jan. 1. 'The voters didn't elect only Republicans. They didn't elect only Democrats. And they don't want either party to govern stubbornly, demanding their way or the highway,' Reid said. But on the Republican side, McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, the presumed speaker-to-be, face an emboldened conservative wing that could prove intolerant of any compromise with Democrats - even if it forces lawmakers to meet far into December. 'Our agenda-setting demand for the elimination of earmarks is a clear indication of our intent to carry out the will of the 2010 election results immediately and for many years to come,' Mark Meckler, national co-coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement. Amid the tumult of leadership elections and an arriving batch of freshmen who promise to challenge the institution at every turn, Congress faces a series of pressing deadlines on fiscal and economic policy. Emergency jobless benefits will expire Nov. 30 unless Congress acts, leaving as many as 3 million people without unemployment checks. Doctors who see Medicare patients also face a Nov. 30 deadline: Their rates are scheduled to be cut by 23 percent unless lawmakers approve a reprieve. A new budget bill must be adopted by Dec. 3 to keep the government from shutting down. And House Democrats want to push through another $250 bonus for Social Security recipients, who otherwise would receive no cost-of-living increase for a second year because of the weak economy. Job One for both parties, however, is preventing the expiration of an array of tax cuts that benefit virtually every American family. The cuts, enacted during the George W. Bush administration and in last year's economic stimulus package, are set to expire Dec. 31. Unless Congress acts, workers across the income spectrum could see sharp reductions in take-home pay starting in January. For example, a middle-class family with two children making $40,000 a year would have an additional tax bite of $212 a month if the tax cuts lapse, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Meanwhile, a family with four kids earning $100,000 a year would stand to lose nearly $440 a month. So far, public attention has focused on the Bush tax cuts, which reduced rates on income, capital gains and dividends; eliminated a built-in tax penalty for married couples; and doubled the child tax credit, among other provisions. Republicans want to extend all those cuts, while Democrats want to let them expire for family income above $250,000 a year. Since the midterm elections, both parties have been inching toward a compromise that would temporarily extend the cuts for all taxpayers. However, it remains unclear what shape such a deal could take. The White House wants to 'decouple' the upper-income cuts from cuts that benefit the middle class by extending them for different periods of time. For example, cuts that benefit families making less than $250,000 a year could be permanently embedded in the tax code, while those that affect wages above that threshold could be extended for one or three years, forcing Republicans to try to extend them separately. Democrats have ruled out a two-year extension to avoid a tax fight in 2012, when Obama is up for reelection. 'Everybody recognizes the concern with doing two years,' said one Democratic aide who is enmeshed in the tax-cut debate and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss party thinking. Key Republicans have dismissed decoupling as unacceptable and are pressing for all the provisions to be extended for the same period of time - a position many Democrats view as capitulation. As lawmakers prepare for a meeting on the topic that the White House has set Thursday, various options are bubbling up, including Schumer's proposal to increase the income threshold from $250,000 to $1 million and a plan by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., to wipe out the upper-income cuts and replace them with $65 billion worth of tax breaks for business. The tax debate is not expected to begin in earnest until after Thanksgiving, when lawmakers could see yet another issue heaped on their plates: a possible Dec. 1 report from Obama's bipartisan deficit commission. If 14 of the panel's 18 members can agree on a plan to cut spending, raise taxes and trim Social Security benefits, Democratic leaders have vowed to stage a vote on the proposal by the end of the year.

1,"Liverpool's board of directors won the latest court battle in the drawn-out attempt to sell the club to the owners of the Boston Red Sox on Thursday, leaving the current American owners with slim hopes of using the Texas legal system to block the deal. On a second successive day of legal wrangling on both sides of the Atlantic, a British High Court judge granted an injunction against co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr., ordering them to withdraw their legal action in a Dallas district court. The order effectively nullified a temporary restraining order Hicks and Gillett had obtained on Wednesday to block the 300 million pound ($476 million) sale of the club to New England Sports Ventures, which is headed by financier John Henry. 'We are nearly there,' Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton said. 'We are still in court in Texas. We still have to do that. We still have to take away the restraining order ... Mr. Henry is (still) very committed.' Hicks and Gillett -- who stand to lose more than 140 million pounds if the sale goes through -- have described the attempted sale as an 'epic swindle' that undervalues English football's most successful club. Judge Christopher Floyd ordered them to withdraw their action by 4 p.m. London time Friday (1500 GMT) or be held in contempt of court. But hours later, Texas District Judge Jim Jordan said NESV's motion to lift the temporary restraining order he issued on Wednesday blocking the sale would not be heard until 7 a.m. on Friday in Dallas -- 1 p.m. London time. At the Dallas hearing on Thursday, NESV lawyers argued Liverpool was headed for default if Jordan didn't rule on Friday, but couldn't provide documentation of that when Jordan asked. Hicks lawyer Geoffrey Harper asked for two days to review the NESV motion. 'If you grant this relief, the injunction is moot,' Harper said. 'They will have closed (the sale).' Jordan resisted the urging of NESV attorneys to rule immediately on their request to lift the restraining order and set a hearing for early Friday to help the sale process in England. 'I want this issue to be resolved for the parties,' Jordan said. NESV lawyer David Chivers said the sale would go through once the Texas order was withdrawn -- and the Boston group already considers itself to be in charge. 'We are the owners (of Liverpool),' Chivers told the High Court. 'The owners from beyond the grave are seeking to exercise with their dead hand a continuing grip on this company.' Floyd harshly criticized the owners for turning to an American court after losing a previous case at the High Court on Wednesday, calling it 'unconscionable conduct on the part of Mr. Hicks and Mr. Gillett.' 'This case has no real connection to Texas,' Floyd said. Attorneys for Hicks denied on Thursday they went to the Texas court only after the London court ruled against them. But Hicks and Gillett were accused by the English judge of initially concealing the High Court action from the Texas judge. 'It's a deliberate omission not to mention the fact,' Floyd said. '(The owners) are anxious to secure a second bite of the cherry in that famous jurisdiction, the Dallas county court,' added Richard Snowden, a lawyer representing Royal Bank of Scotland, which holds the bulk of the club's debts. 'We say the proceedings brought in Dallas are abusive, vexatious and oppressive. Having lost in front of your lordship, they have simply gone to another jurisdiction.' While the London court hearing was being held, lawyers for Hicks and Gillett asked the Texas court to hold the three Liverpool board members in contempt for trying to push through the sale. 'This is the most outrageous abuse of process,' Snowden said. 'The proceedings in Texas are plainly inappropriate. This dispute concerns an English football club and their English companies. 'It has nothing to do with Texas other than the fact that Messrs. Hicks and Gillett may reside there.' Despite the restraining order issued from Texas, the Liverpool board voted on Wednesday for the second time to approve the sale to NESV. 'Further showing their unlawful intentions and brazen disregard for their obligations, defendants have undisputedly -- and, according to their statements, quite proudly -- violated this court's temporary restraining order,' the motion said. Anthony Grabiner, a lawyer representing the Liverpool board at the London hearing, called the Dallas court case 'frankly preposterous.' 'It reads like a novel,' he said. 'If it wasn't so serious, it would be a joke. ... It's a grotesque parody of the truth.' Debts and liabilities resulting from Hicks and Gillett's leveraged purchase of the club three years ago have grown to around 285 million pounds ($453 million), which is owed to RBS and Wells Fargo by Friday. Two others bids emerged this week -- one from Singapore businessman Peter Lim and another from an American hedge fund Mill Financial. Hicks and Gillett said on Wednesday there was also a bid from FBR Capital Markets for between 375 and 400 million pounds ($595 million to $635 million). Lim said Wednesday he will not proceed with his bid because the board is intent on selling to NESV 'at the exclusion of all other parties.' Liverpool faces a Friday deadline to repay its debts to RBS. If Liverpool is put into financial administration, a form of bankruptcy protection, the club would be docked nine points by the Premier League. However, it seems unlikely that RBS would take the club into administration at this point. Liverpool, an 18-time English league champion, is currently mired in the relegation zone after its worst start to a league season since 1953. ------ Associated Press Writer Schuyler Dixon in Dallas contributed to this report.

1,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: Five years after the tsunami unleashed its destructive fury in the Indian Ocean, large-scale reconstruction is still under way in Aceh, the Indonesian region where an estimated 200,000 people died. In Haiti, where the scale of damage and death from last week's earthquake may be roughly comparable _ but whose challenges in rebuilding are even greater _ recovery is likely to be an even longer process. The United States and other major international donors should prepare for that long-term commitment to help with humanitarian, logistical, engineering and nation-building tasks but without raising false hopes that outside aid alone will deliver Haiti. In the wake of wars, natural disasters and political upheavals, international donor conferences are notorious for pledging far more assistance than eventually is delivered. In Haiti, where an epic calamity has afflicted the nerve center of a desperately poor country, there must be real follow-through. Billions of dollars will be needed to help Haiti clear its rubble, rebuild its shattered basic infrastructure, help its shell-shocked government reconstitute itself and provide basic shelter to hundreds of thousands of people who lack it. The rebuilding effort should provide a badly needed initial stimulus for the country's supine economy. As U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon observed after he toured the ruins of Port-au-Prince the other day, enormous numbers of Haitian youths are in the streets with nothing to do _ no jobs, no homes, no hopes; the longer they are idle, the more they will pose a threat to the capital's tenuous security. They must be put to work clearing roads and rubble. The United Nations is already providing some cash for that work, and the World Bank is considering a food-for-work program. At the same time, helping the Haitian government with administrative, technical and reconstruction expertise is critical both to safeguard Haiti's sense of sovereignty and as an investment in the future. In the long term, no superstructure of international donors, no matter how well intentioned and coordinated, will be successful without the partnership of a functioning Haitian government. For decades Haiti has been one of the world's most vexing basket cases, a country practically overrun with governmental and charitable aid agencies whose efforts seemed to barely affect the profound poverty. It may be too much to imagine the developed world will now somehow 'get Haiti right' or make it into some suddenly prosperous Caribbean tiger. But there are ways to improve on previous efforts. One is by constancy; donors cannot be allowed to lose interest when the television cameras depart. Another is by encouraging, training and supporting Haitians to take a more active hand in reconstruction and aid projects. Donors and aid organizations cannot neglect the Haitian countryside, whose grinding poverty has encouraged the unsustainable growth of Port-au-Prince. Establishing systems of accountability in the disbursement of aid and nurturing Haitian civil society will also help minimize the corruption for which Haiti has become notorious. "
1,"President Barack Obama will announce Thursday his intention to impose a fee on roughly 20 of the country's largest banks and financial institutions to help recoup taxpayer bailout money and trim the federal budget deficit. Obama will outline his proposal to raise as much as $120 billion at the White House, Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters. Gibbs said the president's economic team has worked on a structure to prevent the levy from being passed onto consumers. The fees, expected to be spread over as many as 10 years, will be based on the leverage or amount of liability each firm has, according to an administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The final cost of the fees will be based on total losses from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which administration officials expect to drop from the current Treasury estimate of $120 billion. The White House declined to provide a list of banks that would be targeted. The move may have a bigger political than fiscal impact. By including it in the budget message that he will send to Congress next month, the president is tapping into public anger over the bailouts of the financial and auto industries, executive bonuses as well as the deficit. 'The politics on this is really quite easy,' said Doug Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a former managing director at JPMorgan Chase. 'The public would be supportive of anything up to shooting and burning the bankers.' With the unemployment rate at 10 percent and the deficit forecast by the White House budget office to surpass $1 trillion again this year after hitting $1.4 trillion in 2009, Obama and the Democratic Party are seeking to limit voter discontent before the November congressional elections. Adding to potential public backlash are reports that Wall Street's bonus season may be one of its largest even as the economy struggles to pull out of the worst recession since the 1930s. Top House Democrats said the president has a winning issue. 'I'm all in favor of it, but I haven't seen specifics,' said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass. Rep. David Camp, R-Mich., the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said while he and other Republicans find bonuses being paid by banks that got bailouts 'irresponsible' and 'outrageous,' they are concerned that taxing banks will hurt lending, and thus job creation. Still, he said, the proposal puts Republicans in a box. 'We're in the political season,' he said, referring to mid-term congressional elections scheduled for early November. 'It's going to be a tough bill politically to oppose.' The administration is still working out the final details of the levy, which will be part of the fiscal 2011 budget submitted to Congress in early February. The bank levy has been part of discussions since August among Obama and his advisers about ways to recoup taxpayer bailout money and reduce the deficit, advisers said. The financial industry has been a frequent administration target. Obama has leaned on banks to boost lending to small businesses and homeowners facing foreclosure, support his plans for revamping financial regulations and discourage bonuses that encourage excess risk taking. 'They've had a year to figure out how they wanted to participate in the nation's recovery and they don't somehow seem to have gotten that message,' said Anita Dunn, former White House communications director. At meetings with bank executives in Washington and on Wall Street Obama has called on the industry to play a greater role helping Main Street. After a Dec. 14 White House session with executives from some of the nation's largest banks, the president said that now that financial institutions are stabilized after taxpayer bailouts, 'we expect an extraordinary commitment from them to help rebuild the economy.' In an interview broadcast the night before, Obama told CBS's '60 Minutes' program that he didn't run for president 'to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.' Populist anger about bank bailouts spans party lines. Almost two-thirds of Americans believe that aiding the banks was a bad idea, a Bloomberg National Poll taken Dec. 3-7 showed. The levy would hit banks even though the aid is being repaid. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last month that the government stands to make a 'healthy profit' on the money paid out from the $700 billion TARP fund. The federal government is unlikely to recoup its investment in insurer American International Group Inc. or automakers General Motors and Chrysler Group. Those losses and money spent to stem mortgage foreclosures are estimated to be about $120 billion. An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the government expects a maximum of $120 billion to be recouped over 10 years. The fee would taper off as the TARP money is paid back and the total may change if the loss shrinks, the official said. While the legislation required Obama to submit a proposal to recoup money if TARP money isn't repaid after five years, an administration official said the President intended to recoup the taxpayer bailout funds more quickly than the law stipulated. Levying the fee over 10 years will mitigate the impact on parts of the industry that are still hurting, Brookings's Elliott said. 'If you do it as too onerous a burden in concentrating it over fewer years it adds to the chance they'll pass the cost onto customers,' Elliott said. Dunn, who still advises the president, said the administration's challenge is to figure out how to make the financial industry's 'participation in the recovery for the rest of the country meaningful, without doing it in such a way that it creates a potential problem down the road for them.'

1,"There is a pause to ponder in almost every interview, a hiccup in the stream of words, a groping for just the right phrase, and then it emerges: 'With Ray, what you see is what you get.' He has worked for three decades in Washington, capital of spin, of parsing, of nuance, of cunning, of backstabbing intrigue, where half-truths are too common to refute and many a flat-out lie goes without rebuke. Amid all of that, Ray LaHood, the most out-there secretary of transportation in history, is that rare mammal in modern Washington: a regular guy. He says what he thinks, does what he says and clearly loves what he's doing. Were he 34 instead of 64, he'd be pegged as an overachiever bubbling with ambition to catapult himself onto the national ticket. But these days he has more grandchildren than political ambition, and his politics _ conservative but pragmatic, savvy but civil _ aren't fashionable in the polarized savagery of the national debate. So how did LaHood transform what Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show' called the 'least glamorous' Cabinet position into hobnobbing with Jordin Sparks and Oprah Winfrey? 'Lookit,' he says with a shrug, 'the president asked me to do a job, so I'm doing it.' That has meant globe-trotting to check out trains in China, Toyotas in Japan and meetings in Moscow. At home there are just two kinds of states: those he has visited to spread his gospel of safety and to inspect transportation systems, and those he plans to visit soon. Coming after a long line of relative unknowns, LaHood has more than 3,300 Facebook fans, more than 6,000 Twitter followers, and his blog gets more than 40,000 hits a week, second only to President Barack Obama in federal blogdom. And he has used every one of those cyberlinks to tell Americans that it's time to put down the cellphone and pay attention while driving. 'Ray's a rock star,' says Missi Tessier, a colleague from his Capitol Hill days. 'Normally, it's the other Cabinet members who have a much higher profile.' _ _ _ Cabinet stardom can land in your lap: Tim Geithner got the swooning economy; Ken Salazar got the bubbling crude. LaHood got billions in stimulus money to dole out and Mr. Toyoda's sticky gas pedals. But, mostly, LaHood's own drive has elevated him from obscurity at the far end of the Cabinet table. He championed high-speed rail projects, been point man for the administration's advocacy of 'livable communities' with low carbon footprints, and passed out 'cash for clunkers.' His lasting legacy, however, may be the assault on distracted driving, and LaHood hammers on it from every angle that he and his agile staff can devise. They've formed a MADD-like group _ Focus Driven _ persuaded Oprah to devote an entire show and a multi-city rally to the subject, hosted a 'Distracted Driving Summit,' blogged and Twittered on the subject, and they salute each state that has banned text messaging while driving. 'These are preventable deaths,' he says. 'We gotta do something about them.' He has also obtained restrictions on cellphone use by federal workers, banned truck drivers from texting and, after a couple of Northwest Airlines pilots flew 150 miles off course, cracked down on distracted flying. LaHood created heartburn for highway advocates _ and caused bicyclists to nearly swoon _ when he blogged: 'This is the end of favoring motorized transportation at the expense of non-motorized.' The National Association of Manufacturers fired back that the policy was 'dumb ... irresponsible' and 'nonsensical for a modern industrial nation.' Unfazed by the criticism, including the suggestion from a former GOP colleague that he was on drugs, LaHood climbed onto a table at a convention of cyclists to reiterate his support for treating 'walking and bicycling as equals with other transportation modes.' LaHood's bent for candor rarely gets ahead of his political acuity, but when he blunders, it's a doozy. When a House committee member asked what he would tell Toyota owners, he said, 'My advice is, if anybody owns one of these vehicles, stop driving it.' By the time he reeled that one back in, Toyota stock had plunged 7 percent, erasing $3 billion of the company's value. Still, he generally receives high marks for taking a tough stance in public with the auto giant while working the back channels with typical LaHood gentility to achieve results. _ _ _ LaHood came into the bully pulpit of a Cabinet job through the back door: He is a lifelong Republican serving a Democratic president. Though he knew Obama because they both hail from Illinois, his friendship is with the president's right-hand man, chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. How a bare-knuckled Jewish Democrat from Chicago and an Arab-American Republican from Peoria became fast friends provides a window into LaHood's personality. Perhaps the most telling tidbit is that LaHood has resided in Washington for 30 years without once getting a haircut here. A man truly lives where he gets his haircut, and that is in Peoria. 'He's a very good politician, but in his gut he's not a politician,' says Mike Johnson, a former colleague. 'He's a very dependable sort. He's a Peorian, not a Washingtonian.' LaHood taught junior high school in Peoria before becoming an aide to Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Ill. LaHood was appointed to the Illinois legislature but couldn't hold onto the seat, so he became hometown aide to House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill. He later succeeded Johnson as Michel's chief of staff. 'He's got a good gift for dealing with people,' Michel says. 'I don't think I know anyone who doesn't like Ray LaHood. He's got a real pleasing, disarming personality.' All of which he needed in the increasingly strident air of GOP machinations on the eve of an era that brought Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay to power. 'It was a very challenging time,' Tessier says. 'If you weren't a DeLay person or an Armey person, you were on the wrong side of the spectrum.' Michel, respected for his courtly manner and deft hand at the art of compromise, stood squarely in the crosshairs of the Republican Revolution. When he stepped aside in 1994, LaHood ran for the seat, one of only three GOP candidates who refused to sign the Contract With America that was the party's election manifesto. The new Republican leadership viewed him as no better than Michel _ scorned as a Beltway insider _ and rationed LaHood's power until the day that they handed him the gavel to preside over the impeachment of President Clinton. In that moment of immense national tension, LaHood the teacher taught the lesson learned from his second-generation parents, his upbringing in Peoria and his stewardship under Michel. 'Ray showed that you could be civil and still be principled,' says Bill Gavin, a former Michel speechwriter. 'Civility is like oil in a car's engine. It doesn't run on oil, but without it, it overheats and breaks down. Ray understands civility.' LaHood loves his job because, he says, 'it's so bipartisan. There are no partisan bridges.' He plans to stay 'as long as the president wants me,' then go home because 'my heart is always in Peoria.' That is, after all, where he gets his haircut. And Pam Springer, who has been cutting it for 27 years, says he 'doesn't have easy hair to do because it's curly, and it does whatever it wants to.' Much like LaHood. 'He's just a regular guy,' Springer says. 'What you see is what you get.' "
1,"President Obama has called and chatted with Shirley Sherrod. Tom Vilsack and Ben Jealous have issued heartfelt apologies. There is talk of a 'Chardonnay summit' in the Rose Garden. The subtext to all this? Let's wrap up this incident quickly so we can all go on our vacations guilt-free, secure in the knowledge that our 'post-racial society' remains intact. Once again, in the midst of the cacophony, calls abound for a national 'dialogue' on race. Yet our nation cannot muster the patience or stamina to sustain such a discussion beyond a single news cycle. In some ways, Sherrod's tale is a metaphor for this country's aborted efforts to address race. In its entirety, her deeply moving story was about transformation and reconciliation between blacks and whites. It contained the seeds of progress and healing. She spoke of blacks and whites working together to save farms and to end poverty and suffering. But Sherrod, and those listening to her story, could get to her hopeful conclusion only by first wading through painful admissions of racial bias and struggle. Unfortunately, our news and political cycles make it impossible for any of us to stay in a room long enough to reach that transformative moment. At the barest suggestion of race, we line up at opposite corners and start hurling accusations. Attorney General Eric Holder was widely criticized last year for suggesting that we are a 'nation of cowards' when it comes to such discussions. The reaction to his comments is a reminder that we cannot continue to ignore this challenge. Yet Americans refuse to acknowledge that, in today's society, racial attitudes are often complicated, multi-layered and conflicted. Racial inequality is perpetuated less by individuals than by structural racism and implicit bias. Evidence of structural inequality is everywhere: in the grossly disproportionate numbers of young black men and women in prison; in the color of students shunted into remedial and special education tracks; in the stubborn segregation of our neighborhoods and schools; in the lack of recreational and academic opportunities for children of color in poor communities; in the inferior medical treatment that people of color receive; and in the still appallingly small numbers of men and women of color in law firms, corporations and government. It is evident, too, in the history of blatant discrimination against black farmers practiced by the Agricultural Department. But that does not make doctors, nurses, police officers, judges, teachers, lawyers, city planners, admission officers or others prejudiced. Most are well- intentioned professionals who believe themselves to be free of racial bias. From their perspective, it is not easy to connect individual actions and decisions to broader structural conditions and environments built up over decades and even centuries. Implicit bias is a reality we must confront far more openly. A growing mass of compelling research reveals the unconscious racial stereotypes many of us harbor that affect our decisions. Such attitudes do not make us prejudiced; they make us human. Those who take the Implicit Association Test often express shock when results show that their unconscious biases conflict with their explicit egalitarian values and ideals. Nonetheless, white and black test-takers match black faces more quickly than white ones with words representing violent concepts and are more likely to mistake a harmless object for a gun when it is carried by a black person. One study found that the more stereotypically black the features of a criminal defendant, the harsher the sentence he or she is likely to receive. Implicit bias has been shown to factor into hiring decisions and into the quality of health care that individuals receive. Mazharin Banaji and Jerry Kang, leading scholars on implicit bias, h ave noted: 'As disturbing as this evidence is, there is too much of it to be ignored.' The good news is that structures can be dismantled and replaced and unconscious biases can be transformed, as happened to Shirley Sherrod and the family she helped, the Spooners. First, though, they must be acknowledged. We and others researching race and justice are committed to untangling the web of structures, conditions and policies that lead to unequal opportunities. Our nation has to stop denying the complexity of our racial attitudes, history and progress. Let's tone down the rhetoric on all sides, slow down and commit to listening with less judgment and more compassion. If Americans did so, we might find that we share more common ground than we could have imagined. Charles J.

1,"European Union police in northern Kosovo fired tear gas Tuesday to disperse about 100 Serbs protesting the reconstruction of Albanian houses in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica. Seven people were injured as protesters on both sides threw stones while police tried to separate them, said police spokesman Sami Mehmeti. He added that shortly after the clash an explosion and gunfire were heard in the area. The clash between Serbs and ethnic Albanians is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the town. Serbs condition the return of ethnic Albanians to Serb areas of Kosovo on the return of Serbs to the Albanian-run south. Kosovo's government does not have control over the country's north where the beleaguered Serb minority opposes Kosovo's independence, which has so far been recognized by 62 countries. Recently, tensions between ethnic Albanians and the EU have also been on the rise due to an agreement that EU mission officials in Kosovo want to sign with Serbia on exchange of information. Highlighting the ethnic Albanian opposition to such a deal, activists from a group called Self-determination on Tuesday overturned some 24 vehicles of the EU mission -- known as EULEX -- in the capital Pristina, puncturing tires and smashing windows. Twenty activists were arrested. EULEX condemned the attack on its vehicles, saying in a statement that 'committing criminal damage does not further the interests or the arguments of any such protesters.' "
1,"Some countries overthrow their politicians. Some endure them. In Britain, they just laugh at them. The renowned British sense of humor is on display in a new London exhibition that charts 300 years of the anarchic artistic spirit that produced the political satire of William Hogarth and 'Spitting Image' -- as well as the sheer silliness of Benny Hill. 'Rude Britannia,' which opens Wednesday at the Tate Britain gallery, is a feast of irreverence and bad taste that asks whether there is a distinctively British sense of humor, and examines how humor is intertwined with the country's cultural and political history. 'This isn't necessarily about 'funny ha ha,' although there are jokes,' Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis said Monday. 'It's about how the comic is used to do things we can't do in other ways. Often the comic artist is making a very serious point about something that can't be said openly.' Curator Martin Myrone said there has long been a belief that 'a distinct British character -- informal, humorous, sarcastic' has produced a strong seam of comic art. He said that while arguing for national character in art is problematic -- and not all the artists in the show are British by birth -- 'humor has had a very important role to play in the way the story of British art has been told.' While European artists like Jacques-Louis David were striving to create a high-minded new classicism 200 years ago, in Britain the likes of Thomas Rowlandson, James Gillray and Hogarth were using their talents to satirize and caricature the politicians of the day. The exhibition begins in the 17th century, when printing technology first allowed the mass production of cartoons and political broadsides. Then, as now, cartoonists took aim at politics, the economy and social ills. One of the earliest works shows Oliver Cromwell, who overthrew the monarchy, donning the regalia of a king. The more things change, many of the artists here seem to say, the more they stay the same. Some of the images are tastelessly timeless, like the anonymous 18th-century etching 'Idol-Worship or the Way to Preferment,' which shows gentlemen kissing the enormous posterior of Robert Walpole, a politician widely regarded as Britain's first prime minister. Throughout the exhibition, crass toilet humor intertwines with the political. The crude slapstick of TV's 'Benny Hill Show' or the 'Carry On' movies is as central to the British comic tradition as the exalted Hogarth. One of the show's six themed rooms is devoted to explicitly bawdy art, from 200-year-old erotic etchings to the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill, full of plump, smiling figures emitting double entendres that may even cause blushes among readers today. They are on display still attached to the index cards kept by a disapproving public prosecutor, who amassed a thick file on McGill. The exhibition's centerpiece is a room devoted to politics, showing how artists have skewered politicians from Napoleon Bonaparte to Adolf Hitler and prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. British political cartoons are often much more vicious and visceral than their North American counterparts. In one of the milder instances, the Guardian's Steve Bell invariably depicted Prime Minister John Major wearing his underpants over his trousers. Another editorial cartoonist, Martin Rowson, has shown post-Iraq war Blair drenched in blood. In the 1980s, satirical puppet show 'Spitting Image' depicted Thatcher as a butcher with a bloody cleaver. Cartoonist Gerald Scarfe turned her into a prehistoric predator: the Torydactyl. Today, Scarfe acknowledges affection for the Iron Lady as a subject, despite their political disagreements. 'Mrs. Thatcher was great, because she was a strong woman and she produced strong images,' he said. 'The cartoon comes from the character. You can't make weak people strong.' Many of the works on display mock, but some also appeal for change. Hogarth's 1751 'Gin Lane' and George Cruikshank's 1862 'The Worship of Bacchus' are both savage depictions of the damage done by excessive alcohol that helped change social attitudes. In the 1930s, David Low's cartoons of Hitler helped turn British feeling against appeasement. Posters used by protesters against the invasion of Iraq unsuccessfully exhorted Blair to 'Make Tea, Not War.' Scarfe, whose work appears in the Sunday Times newspaper, said at the best of times comic art 'can produce a kind of rallying point around which people can gather and think, 'That's what I was feeling but couldn't put into words.'' 'I hope it helps sum up people's feelings and hopefully eventually it can become a movement,' he said. Scarfe is, however, realistic about the limits of satire's power. He says many politicians secretly enjoy being caricatured, and often ask if they can buy cartoons of themselves. And after centuries of satire, Britain officially remains a monarchy with its upper class firmly intact. Laughter has not led to revolution. 'Perhaps we haven't had a revolution because of the safety valve provided by that satirical art,' Myrone said. 'So it can be quite a conservative force.' ------ 'Rude Britannia' is at Tate Britain until Sept. 5. Online: http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/ "
1,"New Zealand and Australia opened their European tours with hard-fought wins over Wales and England on Saturday. Wales held New Zealand 6-6 at halftime before a second-half try by Andrew Hore and two more penalties by Dan Carter gave the All Blacks a 19-9 victory, while England led Australia 9-5 at the break but conceded 13 unanswered points to lose 18-9. Australia sorted out early indiscipline that threatened to hand victory to England and the returning Jonny Wilkinson but New Zealand could have thrown away victory at the end. Wales lock Alun-Wyn Jones intercepted a loose pass by New Zealand's Jimmy Cowan and raced into space but the second-row didn't have the speed to make it to the line and the move broke down. 'I was pretty nervous and absolutely shattered,' Carter said. 'Credit to the Welsh guys, too, but we're very thankful of coming away with the win. 'It's been a very challenging year for us, a couple of losses, but we want to put our name back on the world stage so to have a big win tonight is very satisfying.' Wales started the game well, supported by a sellout crowd at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but wasted a chance to take an early lead when Leigh Halfpenny missed a penalty. Carter and Wales' Stephen Jones each kicked two penalties in a fast-paced first half. The All Blacks scored its try in the 55th minute when Hore powered over the line after some quick rucking. Carter converted and added another penalty in the 64th. Wales rallied late with two more penalties from Jones but still has not beaten New Zealand in 21 games since 1953. 'We are frustrated,' Jones said. 'We had some opportunities, particularly at the end, but to be fair to New Zealand they are clinical, they recycle the ball very well and that put us under a lot of pressure. 'We made a few errors and that allowed them to get on the front foot.' Both England and Australia head into their matches next week against Argentina and Ireland with high hopes after Will Genia and Adam Ashley-Cooper touched down at Twickenham to give the Wallabies victory by two tries to none. The Wallabies were able to resolve the sort of discipline problems that England exhibited 12 months ago, while England led a more experienced side 9-5 at halftime and have Wilkinson back in the sort of form he showed before shoulder surgery, knee damage, appendix removal, hernia operation, a lacerated kidney and other injuries interrupted his progress. 'I've said to the guys, we were playing a pretty battle-hardened team coming straight out of the All Blacks game and a Tri-Nations series and that probably showed,' England team manager Martin Johnson said. 'That's the first game that team has really played together and we'll be better for having it when we play next week. 'But that doesn't excuse some of the things that happened. We'll improve for next week and the week after as well.' England invited pressure on its own line as its attacking play became hesitant and obvious following Genia's first-half try, with only the absence of center Stirling Mortlock and the penalty count stopping Australia from taking further advantage. England dominated the lineout and opened up the hard-tackling Aussies when its backs got quick ball, but it didn't happen enough and the visitors were never seriously threatened after Wilkinson kicked England 9-5 ahead in the 26th minute. 'The blokes came out today and showed their composure,' Australia coach Robbie Deans said. 'With trust and patience, they got their reward and that's a habit we've got to keep.' Wilkinson started an international for the first time in 18 months and roused the crowd with a third-minute drop goal and then a penalty awarded when wing Peter Hynes lifted Ugo Monye off the ground in the tackle. But wing Matt Banahan stepped into touch while arguing that a kick by Australia had already bounced out, giving the tourists a platform from which to attack inside the 22. They switched play to the left and, after concerted pressure, scrumhalf Genia darted off the back of a maul to reach out and touch down. Matt Giteau missed the conversion and Wilkinson struck again but Australia camped in England's half for the first 10 minutes of the second half and Giteau kicked Australia into an 11-9 lead. Fullback Ashley-Cooper put the gloss on the performance 10 minute from the end when he held off Cueto, Monye and Ayoola Erinle to crash over in the corner. "

1,"'Robin Hood' (PG-13, 140 minutes): Dark and polemic, Ridley Scott's film is less about a band of merry men than a whole country of angry ones. Set in an England bankrupted by war, Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is a bowman under King Richard the Lionheart. When Richard is killed, Robin carries his crown back to England and into the hands the treacherous Prince John (Oscar Isaac). But Robin must also return the sword of slain nobleman Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge) to his family. To avoid accusations of theft, Robin temporarily assumes Loxley's identity. However, he is asked to stay by Robert's father and to continue the impersonation and live as husband to Robert's widow, Marion (Cate Blanchett). The bad guy is Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong), King John's chief tax enforcer and a spy for the French, who hope to take advantage of the civil unrest he's sowing. The film shows little of the Robin Hood we know, suggesting you may have to wait for 'Robin Hood II' for that story. Contains plentiful violence, sensuality and some sexual humor. DVD extras: A two-disc set contains an unrated version of the film (155 minutes); deleted scenes; 'Rise and Rise Again: Making Ridley Scott's Robin Hood' and the art of Nottingham 'The Secret in Their Eyes' (R, 129 minutes): This absorbing story of the unlikely intersection of an unrequited love affair and an unresolved crime opens in the present day. Retired prosecution investigator Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) begins work on a novel about a case that has been haunting him since 1974, when a young woman was brutally raped and killed and the legal system failed to bring her killer to justice. When Benjamin takes a draft of his book to his former boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil), they begin to reminisce about their own relationship, professional and otherwise. If the film's climactic twist borders on the luridly outlandish, director Juan Jose Campanella deserves credit for staging it with restraint and for assembling a first-rate cast of seasoned actors. Contains a rape scene, violent images, graphic nudity and profanity. In Spanish with subtitles. DVD extras: commentary by Campanella; 'Behind the Scenes' and 'Casting' featurettes. Also: 'The Experiment' and 'Stomp the Yard: Homecoming.' "
1,"Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday retained a pledge to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low for an 'extended period' and signaled that European indebtedness may harm American growth. 'The economic recovery is proceeding' and 'the labor market is improving gradually,' the Fed's Open Market Committee said in a statement in Washington. Still, 'financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad.' Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is trying to cut unemployment that's close to a 26 -year-high and maintain the recovery as new- home sales slide and growth in private payrolls weakens. He must also contend with fallout from the European debt crisis, which has pushed share prices lower and threatens to shake consumer and business confidence. The central bank, at a two-day meeting, left the overnight interbank lending rate target unchanged in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it's been since December 2008. High unemployment, low inflation and stable price expectations 'are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period,' the Fed said, repeating language from every policy meeting since March 2009. Policy makers won't raise rates until the first quarter of next year, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists this month. The European crisis has prompted analysts at Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, UBS and Deutsche Bank to push back by several months their predictions for a Fed rate increase. U.S. central bankers repeated that inflation is 'likely to be subdued for some time.' The Fed also said that 'prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower.' Prices in April rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier under the Fed's preferred index, which excludes food and energy costs, the slowest pace since 2001. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig dissented from the decision for the fourth straight meeting, reiterating his view that the low-rate pledge may fuel asset-price bubbles and limit the central bank's flexibility to raise borrowing costs.. Rising investor concern that Greece's debt woes might spread prompted European governments early last month to backstop the euro with a rescue fund of almost $1 trillion. Fed policy makers held an emergency meeting on May 9 to authorize restarting currency swaps with central banks in Europe, Canada and Japan after closing the financial-crisis program in February. The outstanding balance as of June 16 was $1.24 billion, compared with a high of $583.1 billion in December 2008. The Fed statement didn't mention the one other remaining open emergency-lending program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which has been scheduled to close on June 30. The program was designed to aid the commercial real-estate market by subsidizing investor purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Since the last meeting, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has dropped about 8 percent. Private employers added 41,000 jobs in May, down from a gain of 218,000 in April. Housing starts fell 10 percent to the lowest level this year, sales of previously owned homes dropped the most in four months and retail sales fell for the first time in eight months. Fed policy makers delivered updated quarterly economic forecasts at this week's meeting, and economists including former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley say officials probably trimmed their expectations for U.S. growth. In April, Fed governors and regional presidents projected an expansion of 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent this year and 3.4 percent to 4.5 percent in 2011. The central bank will release minutes of the meeting, including forecasts, on July 14. Not all signs are pointing to a growth slowdown. Manufacturing expanded in May for a 10th month as a private export index climbed to the highest level in two decades. Confidence among U.S. consumers rose in June to the highest level in more than two years, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey. Inflation has slowed further in data released since policy makers last met. The Labor Department's consumer price index fell 0.2 percent in May after a 0.1 percent drop in April, the first consecutive declines since 2008. Excluding food and energy, the core rate rose 0.9 percent in May from a year earlier, matching the smallest year-over-year gain since 1966.

1,"NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase will give its investment bankers iPads to provide an additional mobile tool as Apple expands its domain to Wall Street, threatening Research in Motion Ltd. in a market it traditionally dominated. 'We believe there are real benefits in our working environment that can be realized using this device - as well as the personal productivity and enjoyment that come as part of the package,' two managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan said in an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. Apple is building on its momentum in the tablet space, leveraging its 95 percent market share to expand from its traditional consumer base into the corporate market as RIM readies a rival device, the BlackBerry PlayBook. The Canadian maker of smartphones is trying to catch up with Apple as banks including Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group unveil applications for the iPad and Citigroup and Bank of America consider letting employees use iPhones instead of Wall Street's 11-year-old device of choice, the BlackBerry. 'Apple represents a clear and present danger for RIM going forward,' said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher & Co. 'For the first time you have a viable alternative to secure mobile communications and by and large we see people moving away from the BlackBerry platform in droves in favor of the iPhone and the iPad.' JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets behind Bank of America, will distribute iPads free of charge to all associates in its global investment banking division, the Nov. 24 e-mail shows. Employees will get to keep the device as long as they remain at the unit until the pilot program ends on May 1, 2011. Bankers will be able to access e-mails, contacts, calendar and attachments via Microsoft Outlook, as well as have the ability to mark-up and annotate confidential documents and make client presentations, according to the e-mail. They will also be allowed to download applications for personal use. 'There are a variety of ways to leverage the iPad. Some work off-the-shelf whilst others rely on JPMorgan software/security tools,' the managing directors said. 'Depending on its success we will evaluate if we should repeat this one time initiative and/or expand it to others.' JPMorgan spokeswoman Lauren Francis declined to comment. 'Many corporations, including Wall Street, are looking at iPad for business use,' said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Kaufman Brothers. 'There are two things attracting IT managers to the iPad: it's easy to use and the price is pretty attractive relative to traditional notebooks.' IPad sales jumped 28 percent to 4.19 million units in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since the Cupertino, Calif.-based company unveiled the device in April, it contributed $4.96 billion, or almost 14 percent, to Apple's revenue, Bloomberg data show. The cheapest version of the tablet sells for $499, according to Apple's website. Meanwhile, RIM is winning customers for the tablet ahead of its first-quarter debut. Toronto-based insurer Sun Life Financial has agreed to buy as many as 1,000 PlayBooks, and the Canadian banking unit of ING Groep says it will also purchase the device. Apple overtook RIM in the third quarter as the second- biggest smartphone company with 17.4 percent market share behind Nokia, the world's biggest maker of mobile phones, according to researcher IDC. More than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies are 'deploying or piloting' the iPhone as corporations continue to include the smartphone in their approved device lists, Apple said Oct. 18. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM, couldn't immediately comment. 'This is an interesting trend that definitely has legs,' Gleacher's Marshall said in a telephone interview. 'As contracts roll out on the BlackBerry we're going to see more companies adopt Apple technology. This is a sign of the times and will continue in the future.' --With assistance from Richard Bravo in New York, Hugo Miller in Toronto and Adam Satariano in San Francisco. "
1,"Gardens can relax or energize you, depending on their design. Balance the energy flow in your landscape to ensure it will be comfortable and harmonious. The Chinese have used this method of design for many thousands of years. It is called feng shui, pronounced 'fung shway.' Learning the terminology and concepts of feng shui can help in the understanding of this discipline (see glossary below). Qi (also called ch'i) describes the energy flow that moves over and around objects and people. Too much is not good; too little is bad. Energy can be blocked by walls or trapped in corners, becoming stagnant. The objective is for qi to flow gently through openings, not be too aggressive (positive) or too passive (negative). Strive for a perfect balance of the two in your design. Yin and yang describe the two opposing forces that act on qi. Yin is passive and yang aggressive. This is the goal of balance to achieve in your garden. Feng shui is the discipline of bringing balanced qi to your life, including home and garden. Translated, it means 'wind and water,' two forces that have a great impact on Earth. They are considered part of the cosmic energy that the Chinese believe is in everything. Wind and water carved canyons, eroded mountains, determined locations of cities and dictate whether soil will be rich enough to support life. Front yards represent active yang energy or public space. Yang energy colors are warm reds, yellows, oranges and bright whites. Ideally, front yards should face south because yang energy corresponds to sunlight, a positive force. Back yards represent passive yin energy, or privacy. Yin energy colors are cool blues, purples and greens. Yin also corresponds to darkness, or negativity _ the opposite of yang, which can be good or bad. Qi is most active from the west, so use a heavy metal object, such as a sculpture or urn, to calm energy flow from that direction, if possible. Metal is the element of choice because of its weight. The five elements of feng shui Wood is represented by furniture, structures, thick evergreens and perennials, and the colors blue and green. It is best used in an east-southeast location. Fire is symbolized by barbecues and other fire structures, red vegetables, strongly scented herbs, thorny plants and flowers in warm colors. Use these in moderation in southern locations. Earth is represented by rock gardens, clay pots, brick or stone walls, paving and sweet-smelling herbs. Earth tones are yellow, ochre and russet. Rock gardens are best located center-southwest-northeast. Metal is represented by sculptures, planters, furniture, structures, roofs and gray-green foliage. It's best used in west-northwest locations. Plants with white flowers symbolize metal. Water is represented by water features, winding paths, blue- or blackish-purple- leaved or flowered plants and is symbolized by black. Locate in the north. Ba-Gua (Pah Kwa) compasses are divided into eight pie-shaped sections and will illustrate types of qi you have in various parts of the yard. Make one, and label the compass aspects _ north, northwest, south, southwest, east, southeast, west and northeast. Each section represents one of the compass points. Label energy that flows from each section: nurturing or lethargic from the north; open or intense from the south; fruitful or over-fertile from the east; vigorous or hazardous from the west; calm or volatile from the northwest; comforting or unsettling from the southwest; inspired or provoking from the southeast; and prosperous or stagnating from the northeast. Gardens need not incorporate every feng shui guideline. Landscape design themes can be applied to formal, traditional, cottage, prairie, naturalized, woodland, rock or other types of gardens. Search for a couple of books, and decide which principles make sense for you.

1,"On a damp, chilly Tuesday, guest chef Marcus Samuelsson was still out tromping around the White House garden picking herbs for that evening's state dinner at the White House. Samuelsson, the award-winning chef of Aquavit, a Scandinavian restaurant in New York City, was brought in by first lady Michelle Obama to help prepare a largely vegetarian meal in honor of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is vegetarian. At a preview of the dinner, Mrs. Obama called Samuelsson 'one of the finest chefs in the country.' Samuelsson's mission: dinner for 320 using fresh, sustainable and regional foods that reflect the best of American cuisine and evoke the flavors of India. The result: a menu featuring potato and eggplant salad, red lentil soup and roasted potato dumplings or green curry prawns. Samuelsson, who was born in Ethiopia, raised in Sweden and recently became a U.S. citizen, was out in the garden Monday night and Tuesday harvesting arugula, pineapple sage, fresh dill, oregano and thyme for the meal. Some of the herbs were used in the vinaigrette and others to garnish plates and trays of passed appetizers. At age 39, Samuelsson has a resume that most chefs can only dream of. A graduate of the Culinary Institute in Gothenburg, Sweden, he was hired as Aquavit's executive chef in 1995 and three months later got a three-star review from the New York Times. He received the James Beard Foundation Award for 'Rising Star Chef' in 1999 and was named 'Best Chef, New York' in 2003. Samuelsson is the author of four cookbooks, most recently 'New American Table.' Samuelsson was too busy fixing dinner on Tuesday to do interviews. But he said in a statement: 'As a new American, it is particularly humbling to be part of the exciting and progressive direction the White House is pursuing in all things related to our rich diverse culinary heritage.' Samuelsson worked with White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford on the meal. The desserts -- including pumpkin pie tarts and pear tatin -- came courtesy of Pastry Chef Bill Yosses and his team. The pears were poached in honey from the White House beehive, and the desserts were garnished with mint and lemon verbena from the garden. "
1,"A judge has said a $97 million judgment against U.S. food giant Dole and Dow Chemical Co. cannot be enforced because the Nicaraguan court that issued it neither had jurisdiction nor met international legal standards. A trial court in Chinandega, Nicaragua, had awarded the money in 2005 to 150 Nicaraguan citizens who said they worked on Dole banana plantations between 1970 and 1982. The workers said they had been exposed to a pesticide, dibromochloropropoane or DBCP, that was banned in the U.S. after it was linked to sterility in factory workers in 1977. Dow made DBCP from 1957 until 1977, and Dole used it on the banana farms it operated in Nicaragua until 1979. The court awarded the compensation to the plantation workers for infertility caused by the pesticide under a special law enacted by the Nicaraguan legislature in 2000 specifically to handle their claims. That law 'unfairly discriminates against a handful of foreign defendants with extraordinary procedures and presumptions found nowhere else in Nicaraguan law,' U.S. District Judge Paul Huck wrote in his order Tuesday. Huck's criticism of the special law and the trial court proceedings cited U.S. State Department reports concluding that Nicaragua lacks an effective civil law system, with judges susceptible to corruption and political influence. 'The Nicaraguan trial court found exposure to DBCP simply from the fact that a plaintiff purportedly worked on a banana farm, without regard for the type of work performed (and whether it involved exposure to DBCP) or the duration of the work,' Huck wrote. Phone messages and e-mails to the banana workers' attorneys and the companies' spokesmen and lawyers in Miami were not immediately returned Wednesday, nor was a phone message left for a spokesman at the Nicaraguan embassy in Washington. Dole and Dow's appeal of the judgment in Nicaraguan appellate court is still pending. The companies also contended that the judgment was part of a conspiracy by the banana plantation workers' attorneys to make fake DBCP claims in Nicaragua and the U.S. Those allegations were handled as a separate case. In June, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Victoria Chaney dismissed that case, citing an 'outrageous and profound' conspiracy to extort Dole with false claims by purported plantation workers who said they had been rendered sterile by exposure to the pesticide DBCP in the 1970s. Testimony showed the men were not plantation workers and were recruited by a Los Angeles lawyer and a Nicaraguan associate to lie. Chaney blamed at least four law firms, corrupt Nicaraguan judges who accepted bribes and at least four medical labs that were paid to fake the results of sterility tests. Since Chaney's ruling, Dole has petitioned a California appeals court to dismiss yet another case based on the same evidence. Dole claims that a $1.6 million judgment awarded before the alleged fraud was uncovered should be dismissed. "
1,"NEW YORK -- John Kinnucan's questioning by the FBI in a broad insider-trading investigation has put the spotlight on money managers and their use of a burgeoning breed of firms selling research and access to industry experts. Kinnucan runs Broadband Research from his home in Portland, Ore., digging up data on technology companies for hedge funds and mutual funds looking for an edge in the stock market. Several firms he identified as clients, including SAC Capital Advisors, Wellington Management and Janus Capital Group, have been asked for documents as part of the federal probe in which three hedge funds were raided on Monday. 'My contacts are the foot soldiers and the worker bees of the industry,' Kinnucan, who was interviewed by FBI agents last month, said in an interview Wednesday. Kinnucan, 53, is a small competitor in an industry led by companies like New York-based Gerson Lehrman Group and Guidepoint Global, which link investors with research and experts in a range of sectors, countries and thousands of individual companies. The detailed information they provide on product development, sales and company strategy complement, and sometimes supplant, conventional research provided by Wall Street firms. Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Fla., said he's concerned that the investigation by the U.S. Attorney in New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission may result in criminalizing legitimate research that gives one investor an advantage over another. 'I have an obligation to find out everything I can to protect my clients that invest in a stock,' Bove said. 'When am I crossing the line? If I get information that no one else has, am I therefore not supposed to act on it?' Insider trading involves the buying or selling of stock using material, nonpublic information. Expert networks can include former employees of companies being examined, professors and doctors, Geoff Bobroff, an independent fund consultant in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, said in a telephone interview. Bobroff is part of Gerson Lehrman's network. Bobroff said the use of experts has risen in conjunction with the decline of traditional Wall Street research. Because of mergers, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now account for far fewer equity analysts than they did 10 or 15 years ago, he said. Wall Street was also placed under greater regulatory restrictions after 10 firms collectively paid $1.4 billion in 2003 to settle claims they slanted their research to win banking business. 'This clearly was an outgrowth of the Wall Street settlement on proprietary research,' Bobroff said. Kinnucan, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, said there is nothing inappropriate about his research. Justin Dini, a spokesman for Gerson Lehrman, and James Fingeroth, a spokesman for Guidepoint Global in New York, declined to comment. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has a marketing relationship with Gerson Lehrman. The number of expert networks in the United States has grown to about 40 this year from about eight in 2001, Michael Mayhew, chairman of Integrity Research Associates in New York, said in an interview. Expert networks took in about $450 million to $500 million in combined revenue in the past year, according to estimates from Mayhew, whose firm has published reports on the industry. Gerson Lehrman, based in New York, operates the largest network and has 60 percent of the market, he said. Its database has more than 250,000 experts worldwide, according to the company's website. The most expensive expert networks charge their clients an annual fee as high as $120,000 for each industry group. Others collect hourly fees that can reach $1,000 for consultations with experts, according to Mayhew. Burton Greenwald, an independent fund-industry consultant in Philadelphia, is part of three networks including Gerson Lehrman's, usually providing hedge-fund managers with information and his analysis on listed investment-management companies, he said. 'I've found the networks make an honest and vigorous effort to make sure nonpublic information is not disclosed to the clients who use their services,' he said. 'I have to sign an agreement with Gerson that I won't talk about anyone who is my employer or about nonpublic information.' Greenwald said the phone calls arranged by the networks aren't monitored by the firms that set them up and, theoretically, could be abused by investors seeking insider information. 'The top tier hedge funds may not do this, but I think when you get down to lesser players, you're in the Wild West,' he said. The FBI recently questioned an account manager at Primary Global Research, a Mountain View, Calif.-based expert- network firm, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday on its website, citing people familiar with the matter. FBI agent B.J. Kang, who was involved in last year's Galleon Group insider- trading case, asked most of the questions, the newspaper said. The company hasn't been named as the target of an investigation and isn't accused of wrongdoing, Dan Charnas, a Primary Global spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. 'Should we be asked, we intend to cooperate fully with the authorities,' he said. SAC Capital, the $12 billion hedge fund run by Steven A. Cohen, and Wellington Management, the Boston-based money manager that oversees $598 billion, received requests for information from investigators, people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the firms are private, said yesterday. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC, and Sara Lou Sherman, a Wellington spokeswoman, declined to comment. Janus said yesterday in an e-mailed statement that it got a request for general information and will cooperate with the inquiry. The Denver-based firm didn't identify which agency made the inquiry. None of the research firms or money managers has been accused of wrongdoing. FBI agents two days ago searched the offices of Level Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management. Both hedge funds were founded by former employees of SAC. A third hedge fund, Boston-based Loch Capital Management, was also searched by agents, according to a person familiar with that matter. Kinnucan, who registered Broadband in 1994, said competition among expert networks is fierce these days as research firms like his are proliferating. 'There is a new one every day,' he said. --With assistance from David Glovin in New York federal court, David Voreacos in Newark, N.J., and Saijel Kishan in New York. "
1,"Nepal's president has ordered Parliament to meet in early January to try to end the Himalayan nation's political deadlock and elect a new prime minister, officials said Tuesday. Nepal has had a caretaker government since last June when Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned bowing to pressure from the opposition Maoist party. Parliament has held 16 unsuccesful votes for prime minister since then, and ended its last session in November in a brawl over the annual budget. The political stalemate has set back progress on the peace process that ended the Maoists' insurgency, which claimed thousands of lives. The Maoists are now in the political mainstream but the future of thousands of their former fighters whom they want enrolled in the national army remains unresolved. The country's three top parties -- the Maoists and the two parties that lead the caretaker government -- each want their candidate to be prime minister, but none has a majority in the 601-member chamber and they must agree on a power-sharing agreement to divvy up Cabinet positions. President Ram Baran Yadav said in a statement that he has summoned the Parliament to start a session Jan. 9. The country's winter Parliament session usually begins in February. Dina Nath Sharma, a spokesman for the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), said the groups would try to end their differences and move ahead with national reconciliation efforts. 'Our main and first priority would be to try elect a new prime minister so that a new government can be formed,' Sharma said. Navendra Raj Joshi of the Nepali Congress party said his group is also hopeful that an agreement can be reached on a new government. "
1,"Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi's emotional speech after losing in the doubles final at the U.S. Open may be making a difference for Pakistani sports. Because of violence and terrorism last year, Pakistan has been stripped of its right to co-host next year's cricket World Cup. International tennis and field hockey federations also have been struggling to get other teams to agree to visit the country for matches or tournaments. But it looks like things are changing. 'After what happened in Lahore last year, it will be first time when a team of ITF security officials will be visiting Pakistan in the coming months,' Qureshi told The Associated Press, referring to a deadly attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team's bus en route to a test match. 'Maybe it's because of my speech at the U.S. Open.' Qureshi and Rohan Bopanna, from India, reached the final in New York but lost to Bob and Mike Bryan, the top-ranked doubles team in the world. After the match, Qureshi spoke from the heart at Arthur Ashe Stadium and drew a standing ovation. 'Every time I come here I feel there's a very wrong perception about Pakistan being a terrorist country,' Qureshi said at the time. 'We are very friendly, loving and caring people and we want peace in this world as much as you guys want. May Allah bless us all.' American tennis great Jim Courier, who was conducting the prize ceremony, was impressed, saying the speech was 'beautiful.' But problems remain in Pakistan. Suicide bombings have taken hundreds of innocent lives as the country continues its fight against Al-Qaeda. The government is also struggling to help about 20 million people after recent floods left them homeless. Now, with the International Tennis Federation expected to make its visit, Qureshi is hoping that Pakistan will be able to host Hong Kong in the Davis Cup next year at Lahore. 'Lahore's Defence Club is one of the venues and I am hopeful that if everything goes well, we will see international teams returning to Pakistan in other sports too,' Qureshi said. Qureshi is currently in India for the Commonwealth Games, a multi-sports event that brings together 71 countries and territories from the British Commonwealth. He has already been eliminated from the singles and doubles tournaments, however. 'The draws were pretty tough here,' said Qureshi, who lost to Matt Ebden of Australia in the second round of the singles tournament. In doubles, he and teammate Aqeel Khan lost to Australian pair Paul Hanley and Peter Luczak. 'My partner had to play in the doubles just three hours after he finished his match in singles,' Qureshi said. 'Probably it was asking too much from us in this heat and humidity of New Delhi.' "
1,"America picked up its first victory of the Mexican Apertura season, defeating Jaguares 3-0 on Sunday with goals from Argentine-born Matias Vuoso, Uruguayan Vicente Sanchez and Enrique Esqueda. Defending Clausura champion Toluca got its first point in two matches with a 1-1 draw against Pachuca. In the day's other match, Puebla defeated San Luis 2-1. Three teams have perfect records after two rounds -- Cruz Azul, Santos and Queretaro. In matches Saturday, Santos thrashed Pumas 4-0, Cruz Azul defeated Atlante 2-0, and Queretaro was a 2-1 winner over Atlas. "
1,"Fernando Torres scored on his return from injury as Liverpool beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to halt the club's worst losing streak in 22 years and relieve the pressure on manager Rafa Benitez. Benitez only decided to start Torres while traveling on the coach to the ground, but the gamble paid off when he broke the deadlock in the 65th minute with his first goal in a month. The Spain striker, who still struggled with the adductor strain that had ruled him out of the past two matches, collected Yossi Benayoun's throughball and shook off Rio Ferdinand before lashing a shot past goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. 'We were waiting for that final pass, and when it came we knew he would score,' Benitez said. 'You could see Fernando was not 100 percent fit, but sometimes 80 percent of Fernando can make a difference. 'We had to be very careful with him, that is why we took him off near the end. Now, we have to take care of him.' Both teams had been reduced to 10 men by the time David Ngog added a second goal in stoppage time as Liverpool closed the gap to six points behind leader Chelsea and four back from defending champion United. Two Premier League losses between Champions League defeats had jeopardized Liverpool's hopes of a trophy -- even with seven months of the season remaining. 'This is a very important result. We have to be very happy for the points today and keep going,' defender Jamie Carragher said. 'After that game, playing as a team and working hard, we can beat anyone.' United, Liverpool's fiercest rival, had not been beaten since losing to Burnley in the second round of the season in August. 'It was a bad performance by us. We didn't handle the atmosphere of the game,' United manager Alex Ferguson said. 'Liverpool were the better team, they created more chances. They deserved their victory. We let ourselves down with our penetration.' In a high-tempo first half at Anfield, it was Liverpool defender Fabio Aurelio, deployed on the left wing, who came closest to scoring. The Brazilian curled a free kick toward the top corner in the 15th minute that goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar did well to push away. The ball fell to Dirk Kuyt, whose shot was saved by Van der Sar's legs, and Torres made a poor connection with Liverpool's third attempt to beat the Dutch goalkeeper. Aurelio continued to provide Liverpool's main threat in front of goal, meeting Yossi Benayoun's cross with a header that Van der Sar dived low to keep out. Wayne Rooney was back to spearhead the United attack after recovering from a calf injury. But the visitors only troubled goalkeeper Pepe Reina once in the first half, when he blocked Rooney's low header in the 20th minute. While Liverpool fans outside Anfield protested against the club's American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr., inside all the animosity was reserved for the northwest rivals -- particularly former striker Michael Owen. As United chased an equalizer, Owen was brought off the bench in the 74th to replace Dimitar Berbatov, but made little impression. After Antonio Valencia hit Liverpool's crossbar late on, Carragher brought down Owen and only received a yellow card -- much to Ferguson's annoyance. 'He's their best defender without question. If he goes off at that stage, it makes it difficult for them,' Ferguson said. A United defender was sent off, though, in the 90th minute, with Nemanja Vidic seeing red for the third straight match against Liverpool. In a fiery conclusion, Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano was dismissed in injury time for a second yellow card. Ngog put the result beyond doubt in the sixth minute of stoppage time. Lucas released Ngog, and the substitute slotted past Van der Sar to complete a convincing win. After the match, United captain Gary Neville had a minor confrontation with the police. Officers tried to stop the defender warming down in front of his team's fans, who were boisterous despite losing to Reds for the third straight match. "
1,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, asked for an immediate review of how hackers were able to overtake 49 Web sites operated by House members or House committees following President Obama's State of the Union address. The House Office of the Chief Administrative Officer said members affected included Reps. John Murtha, D-Pa., Mike Pence, R-Ind., and Joe Wilson, R-S.C., and the Web sites for several committees. All are produced and operated by GovTrends, an Alexandria, Va.-based company that specializes in building political Web sites and e-mail newsletter systems, said Jeff Ventura, spokesman for the House chief administrative officer. Eighteen House Web sites operated by GovTrends experienced similar attacks in August, Ventura said. Pelosi and Boehner noted Thursday that they had previously asked the CAO to review and tighten the Web sites' security. Several calls to GovTrends on Thursday went unanswered. Most House Web sites are maintained by the CAO, but about 40 percent are contracted out to private vendors such as GovTrends, Ventura said. The CAO is discussing potential action against GovTrends and efforts to strengthen the security of sites maintained by private companies, he said. "

1,"Trains stood still and children played instead of studied as workers around France went on strike Thursday to protest President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to raise the retirement age to 62. Neighboring countries suffered along with Paris commuters, as walkouts by drivers delayed or canceled trains from Italy and Switzerland. Some flights were dropped or delayed. Boisterous crowds of protesters filled Marseille's port and wide Paris avenues, as unions staged nearly 200 marches in several cities over a broad reform to the money-losing pension system, part of efforts around Europe to cut back on growing public debts. 'Sarkozy, Don't Touch our Pensions!' read one banner at the Paris march, near a cardboard coffin marked: 'Here lies Roger. He's 60, and he died before getting his retirement.' The ranks of demonstrators swelled in comparison to a similar protest May 27. The Interior Ministry put the number of protesters around France at 797,000 -- double the number of people in the streets in May. Police say 47,000 people marched in the French capital, while the powerful CGT union put the number at 130,000. They said least 25,000 people marched in Bordeaux and at least 16,000 turned out in Marseille -- a figure organizers sneered at as blatantly false. 'It's a rather strong mobilization,' Labor Minister Eric Woerth conceded on RTL radio. 'But the reform is ambitious.' Prime Minister Francois Fillon was likely to address the contentious subject of retirement age at a hastily scheduled news conference Friday. Demonstrating his concern about the state of public finances, Sarkozy is cancelling the annual garden party for Bastille Day on July 14, citing the high cost of the glamorous event that is an annual mainstay. France has one of Europe's lowest retirement ages, allowing workers to retire at 60 in most sectors. The government says the reform to the money-losing pension system is an 'obligation,' given France's burgeoning deficit and its aging population. Unions say money for the pension system should come from higher taxes or charges on those who are still working, and see cost-cutting in the pension system as an attack on a hard-fought way of life. Sebastien Sihr, secretary general of the SNUipp union, called the reform 'a step backward.' 'They are refusing to imagine other sources of funding,' he told The Associated Press at the Paris march, where a crowd of thousands whistled and cheered, waving red, white and blue balloons under a hot summer sun. Vuvuzellas, the South African horns the world has become familiar with at the World Cup, made their appearance on French streets. Commuters, meanwhile, made do, some cramming into sweaty, overcrowded buses and subway trains. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Rome's main train station Wednesday when the overnight train to Paris was canceled because of the strike. Authorities were putting the passengers on buses instead. Swiss national railway company SBB said about 60 percent of trains between France and Switzerland have been canceled because of the strike. The French civil aviation authority, DGAC, asked airlines to cancel 15 percent of their flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports because of strikes by air traffic controllers. Air France said long-haul flights would remain unaffected. Commuter Stephanie Larcher, a 29-year-old town planner, from Buressuryvette, in the outskirts of Paris, said she's had to add an extra hour onto her daily four-hour journey. 'I find it completely irritating, especially because train workers go on strike for any little thing,' she said. However, Nathalie Arthaud, head of the far-left party Lutte Ouvriere, denounced 'this world of the rich, ministers, cigars, private jets. It's the same government that tells us to work longer. It's revolting.' About 20 percent of French teachers went on strike, the Education Ministry said. Utility workers, postal workers, dock workers, workers at planemaker Airbus and some hospital workers also took part in the one-day walkout. The French pension reform pales in comparison with more drastic changes elsewhere in Europe. Germany, for example, plans to gradually raise its retirement age from 65 to 67, starting in 2012. Bernadette Douisson, secretary general of the FSU union, said the French government's real concern should be boosting employment in a country where large numbers of youth and seniors can't get jobs. Woerth, the labor minister, says the reform will save nearly euro19 billion ($29.3 billion) in 2018 and should bring the pension system back into the black that year. The reform is scheduled to be instituted progressively, stretching out the number of years people have to work to win full pension payments. The Cabinet is to discuss the proposals in July, and they're expected to go before parliament next autumn. ------ Associated Press writers Jean-Marie Godard in Paris, Victor Simpson in Rome and Eliane Engeler in Geneva contributed to this report.

1,"There are curators in this town who are responsible for some pretty important stuff: the Declaration of Independence, Leonardo da Vinci's picture of Ginevra de'Benci and copies of Shakespeare's First Folio, to name a few. Jack Sustic has his own priceless exhibit to fret over, a Japanese white pine tree that began life circa 1625. The pine is different from the other icons: It's alive, meaning it has the potential not to be alive. Sustic, who is curator of the world-class bonsai collection at the U.S. National Arboretum, is ready for every contingency. 'I've packed a suitcase in the hall. If this died, you wouldn't be able to find me. I would be gone somewhere.' It's a jest, of course; he has no intention of letting this or any of the other 300 specimens fail in the arboretum's National Bonsai and Penjing Museum. Penjing is the Chinese art of dwarfing trees, and it predates the more familiar Japanese bonsai. Both are defined by their haunting paradoxes: How can something as large as a tree be rendered pot size, and how can something so old be so small? The Japanese white pine, started just five years after the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower, is now about 3 1/2 feet tall and four feet across. I used to think of bonsai as a freakish avenue of gardening, but I dismissed that notion years ago. A bonsai needs continual care and the artistic skills of its owner; the tree repays the debt by becoming, literally, a model plant _ a grove of beech trees, a stately old maple, or a bleached, writhing juniper on some imagined mountain top. For all the playacting, there is a deep and quiet relationship between the plant and its caretaker, and isn't that what gardening is all about? The tree is kept small not so much by the constriction of the roots, or the periodic out-of-container root pruning and repotting, but by the careful clipping of the branches. It is an art that at first establishes the lowest branch as the largest, then creates a healthy array of scaffold branches and maintains a convincing canopy of tapering stems. Even old specimens need wiring every few years to keep the pint-size boughs in their horizontal planes. The trick is to remove the copper coils before they imprint themselves on the bark. Bonsai growers favor species and varieties with naturally undersized leaves or short needles to keep the diminutive scale, gravitating to such trees as the trident maple, Chinese elm, finer-textured azaleas and bristly conifers. But after 15 or 20 years of constant care, many of the trees do something quite miraculous: They obligingly produce smaller leaves. In your yard this is a sign of stress; in the bonsai pot it's the plant's recognition that it is getting the feeding, watering and light levels it needs and can reduce the effort it puts into making foliage. The trees must grow in a free-draining soil to avoid root rot, a condition that also requires a remarkable degree of attention. In winter dormancy, you might water a deciduous bonsai once or twice a month; in high summer it's once or twice a day, or it will decline quickly. In the pavilion, I am drawn to the deciduous trees: the trident and Japanese maples, the elms, the beeches and one eye-catching Chinese quince. Leafless but not lifeless, they reveal a branch structure at least decades in the making. In a trident maple, the base of the trunk flares to surface roots, with ripples in the smooth bark that suggest an old tree. The 1625 Japanese white pine has a stout trunk with bark made of red-brown plates, each framed by fissures lined with light green lichens. The trunk forms the hub for 14 or so ascending branches, themselves diverging into two or three more. Here, on its turntable base, sits a survivor. It was one of more than 50 museum-quality specimens donated to the United States for the 1976 bicentennial, including a Japanese red pine from the Imperial Household that has been in training since 1795. The white pine was donated by a bonsai master named Masaru Yamaki, whose family could trace its horticultural roots to the 17th century and had cared for the tree for at least five generations. Yamaki lived in Hiroshima, and years after its donation, his family members visited the tree at the arboretum and began to give a fuller picture of this astonishing plant. Of all the daybreaks that this tree has witnessed, none was more ominous than that of Aug. 6, 1945. At 8:15 a.m. an atomic bomb exploded over the city. The Yamakis' walled bonsai nursery was less than two miles from ground zero. The property, the Yamakis and their ancient trees were all just far enough from the blast, just, to survive it relatively unscathed. I don't attach anthropomorphic qualities to vegetation, but just to be alone in the quiet presence of this tree is moving, and one cannot help but feel reverence for a venerable and palpable life force. Sustic, who came to know and love bonsai when he served in the Army in Korea in the early 1980s, says the art form has taught him patience and humility. 'Bonsai isn't for everyone, but it can be transformative to your life. It certainly was in mine.' He and his assistant, Aarin Packard, are mindful that they are merely stewards of plants that have received the care of generations of gardeners before and, it is hoped, generations yet to come. Sustic recounts the story of the late Yamaki coming to the arboretum about five years after the tree was donated. He stood in front of it and began to weep, and the curator at the time was mortified that Yamaki had seen some decline. But through an interpreter, he said, 'Everything's fine. The tree is happy here.' "
1,"The Tehran prosecutor has filed a lawsuit against two Web sites and their license holders for insulting President Mahmoud Ahmadienjad. A report Tuesday on Iranian state TV says the prosecutor's suit targets the conservative Jahannews and Alef news Web sites. Alef belongs to lawmaker Ahmad Tavakkoli, who has often criticized Ahmadinejad. Jahannews asserted in October that Ahmadinejad helped foment Iran's postelection unrest with his rhetoric against opponents. The lawsuit appears to be part of a government crackdown on dissent. Iran also has a long history of closure of media. Authorities have banned hundreds of newspapers, magazines and Web sites, and arrested dozens of journalists and bloggers since 2000. "
1,"Iranian state television says 13 of the 16 people killed in Friday's plane crash in northeastern Iran were members of the crew. Saturday's report quotes Iran's civil aviation spokesman, Reza Jafarzadeh, as saying the plane's high speed while landing was a key cause of the crash. The Russian-made Ilyushin-62 plane, carrying 153 passengers and crew, skidded off the runway and hit a wall Friday while landing in the northeastern city of Mashhad, killing 16 people. Earlier, officials said 17 were killed. Among the dead was the manager of the privately owned Aria Airlines, which leased the plane from Kazakhstan. The TV report said nine of the dead crew members were Kazakhs and Aria's license has been suspended until the crash is investigated. "
1,"President Hugo Chavez has turned to his friends in Cuba for help in tackling Venezuela's energy crisis, drawing criticism Wednesday from opponents who say that the communist-led island is notorious for its own electricity woes. The socialist leader announced that Cuban Vice President Ramiro Valdes had arrived on Tuesday to head a Cuban team advising Venezuela on its efforts to reduce energy consumption. He gave few details of what Valdes would do, but the announcement bewildered some. 'It's laughable that Chavez is looking for help from Cuba,' said Aixa Lopez, director of the Committee for People Affected by Power Outages, which monitors the extent of current energy shortages and rationing in Venezuela. Chavez blames a drought for bringing the country's crucial hydroelectric reservoirs to their lowest levels in decades, prompting a wave of planned and unplanned blackouts across the country. Critics acknowledge the lack of rainfall, but blame Chavez's government for failing to upgrade power generation capacity even as the country's consumption has soared. Cuba itself has suffered a series of electricity crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union removed a major source of oil and financing. It now gets much of its imported oil from Venezuela. The island's communist government has had some success against once-routine blackouts by upgrading generating capacity and imposing sometimes draconian energy-saving measures. Even so, Cuban officials last summer were forced to idle some state factories while turning off the lights and air conditioners in many government office buildings, banks, retail stores and other businesses. Officials have hinted even more strict conservation methods will be imposed throughout 2010. Chavez has experimented with similar measures, ordering some public institutions to close at 1 p.m. and partially shutting down state-run steel and aluminum plants. Officials also are installing tens of thousands of energy-saving light bulbs imported from Cuba. Cuba is already aiding Venezuela in a cloud-seeding effort the government hopes will ease the drought. Valdes, who fought alongside Fidel and Raul Castro to topple dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959, is a former interior minister and current minister of communications. For more than a decade, he ran Cuba's Electronic Group, overseeing technology projects and skirting the U.S. trade embargo by importing tons of equipment into Cuba through third-party nations. 'The electricity crisis should be resolved by Venezuelans,' Lopez said. 'I don't think that Mr. Valdez is the most suitable for the job because what's he's done in Cuba is impose rationing. He's not en expert in investment, maintenance and production.' ------ Associated Press Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Havana. "
1,"As 30,000 U.S. troops begin to deploy to Afghanistan, fears are rising in Pakistan that a stepped-up war just over the border could worsen the increasingly bloody struggle with militancy here. Residents in border areas such as the violence-plagued city of Peshawar worry that a tide of militants could flee Afghanistan to seek targets in Pakistan. Doubts linger among Pakistani security officials about the Americans' ability to intensify the campaign against the Taliban without further destabilizing Pakistan's vast southwestern border or the already volatile tribal areas in the northwest. 'With a surge in American troops across the border, the militants facing pressure could come to our place, which will destroy peace and stability,' said Haji Adam Khan, the top official in Qilla Abdullah, a mountainous Pakistani district that abuts Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan. U.S. officials disagree with that assessment, reflecting the undercurrents of mistrust between allies whose relationship President Barack Obama has called crucial to success in Afghanistan. Pakistani reservations about the U.S. strategy highlight the limits of an American-led war campaign in Afghanistan that must stop at a famously porous border _ Pakistan does not allow U.S. troops to fight on its soil _ even if the enemy crosses over. A wave of bombings has swept Pakistan since October, devastating Peshawar but also reaching far beyond the troubled northwest. Attacks on places believed to be safe, such as the military headquarters in Rawalpindi and a popular market in the eastern city of Lahore, have struck fear into the population. Last week, Pakistan's foreign minister warned in a statement that the U.S. troop buildup could magnify the problems by bringing an 'influx of militants and refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan.' The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 led thousands of Taliban and al-Qaida members to flee the fighting and seek refuge in Afghanistan. Since then, insurgents have continued to use Pakistan as a staging ground for launching attacks into Afghanistan and within Pakistan. When U.S. troops launched a major offensive in Afghanistan's Helmand province last summer, Pakistani officials feared a fresh influx of militants into their territory. But that did not occur, U.S. and Pakistani military officials said. 'I think it's somewhat exaggerated,' Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and security analyst, said of Pakistani fears about a surge of militants. 'Why should they come here? They already have all the space they need in Helmand' and other Afghan border provinces, he said. U.S. military officials said they are working closely with Pakistan's security forces ahead of the troop increase and note that a stream of top American officials has visited Pakistan to seek support for the strategy. A senior U.S. military official in Pakistan said a spillover of militancy or refugees is unlikely, in part because of regular meetings in which officials from both nations discuss 'where we think the forces are going to go, and if that would cause issues.' The Pakistani military is less sure. It is already stretched thin by military operations in South Waziristan and other tribal areas against the Pakistani Taliban, the group it blames for most domestic attacks. The American plan to focus on control of Afghan cities and improve governance is positive, a Pakistani military official said, but Pakistan fears that U.S. forces might also 'go on a wild goose chase' of targeting Taliban fighters without guarding borders. That could push fighters into Pakistan's tribal areas, reversing military gains there, or into Baluchistan in the southwest, where Pakistan _ which concentrates its forces in the northwest and along the eastern border region with arch-rival India _ has insufficient troops, the official said. Whether or not the new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan fuels violence in Pakistan, the border is likely to be a vexing problem for troops. It is certain that militants will seek refuge in Pakistan, but it is just as likely that extremists based in Pakistan will 'follow the sound of the guns' into Afghanistan, a senior U.S. military official in Afghanistan said. Bolstering border security is a 'key part of the strategy' to prevent both militant movement and the import of bomb-making supplies into Afghanistan, the U.S. official said. But the official also suggested that Pakistan could assist more, by moving troops from the Indian border and by focusing more on 'eliminating' key insurgent leaders to consolidate its military gains. Pakistan has not captured top Pakistani Taliban insurgents during its two-month- old operation in South Waziristan and has declined to pursue the Haqqani network and other groups that attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

1,"The coming-of-age sex comedy 'Youth in Revolt' finds Michael Cera stuck in his same wispy, doe-eyed groove. Even Cera's biggest fans have to admit he has become something of a Johnny One- Note _ that note being high, quavering and perpetually on the verge of fatal mortification. Cera's gift for capturing the adolescent state of chronic embarrassment served him well in the TV series 'Arrested Development.' And it made for perfect casting in such high school comedies as 'Juno' and 'Superbad.' But by 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' and last year's pseudo-documentary 'Paper Heart,' the falsetto diffidence was wearing thin. In 'Youth in Revolt,' Miguel Arteta's adaptation of the C.D. Payne novel, audiences are still supposed to buy the 21-year-old Cera as high school student Nick Twisp, who lives in sex-obsessed misery with his divorced mother and her succession of loser boyfriends. When Nick meets the disquietingly frank Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) during a family getaway at a trailer park in California, he decides to do whatever it takes to be with her _ a vow that will entail random acts of theft, arson, dorm-rule violations and cross-dressing. Arteta ('Star Maps,' 'Chuck & Buck') admittedly brings fresh eyes to the story, maximizing its absurdist humor and using animation to stage some of the episodic story's more procedural sequences. And Cera at least tries, with limited success, to break free of his usual mannerisms when he plays Nick's alter ego, a suave sophisticate named Francois Dillinger. But 'Youth in Revolt' strains as it toggles between observational and slapstick humor. What's more, the characters all seem to be speaking in the same arch, hyper-literary drone _ that is, if they're not dumb trailer-park-dwelling rubes. 'Youth in Revolt' is a movie that feels written rather than lived; from 'The Catcher in the Rye' to 'Rushmore,' it's a story we've seen in better versions before. R.

1,"Marsh & McLennan says it lost money in the second quarter because of an impairment charge tied to the value of one its divisions. The New York-based insurance broker and consulting firm says it lost $193 million, or 37 cents per share. A year ago, it earned $65 million, or 12 cents per share. Excluding the $315 million goodwill charge for its corporate security business, Kroll, and other special charges, Marsh & McLennan earned 33 cents per share. Analysts forecast earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $2.76 billion. Analysts do not typically include special charges in their estimates. Marsh & McLennan's revenue fell 13 percent to $2.63 billion. "
1,"Listening to the fiery rhetoric about the mortgage mess emanating from politicians last week, you'd think that big bad banks were trying to foreclose on hundreds of thousands of homeowners who were current on their payments but had become victims of sloppy business practices. If that were the case, declaring a national moratorium on foreclosures would be the just and reasonable thing to do. But if, as appears to be the case, the overwhelming majority of homeowners facing foreclosure have fallen far behind on their payments, then it is a good deal harder to summon up the same moral outrage over reports that the banks and loan service companies cut corners, failed to keep the right documents and engaged in shoddy and even fraudulent practices. Just because the banks and servicers have screwed up doesn't mean they and their investors are no longer entitled to get their money back. Certainly banks and servicers should, at their own expense, be sent back to do things right. Those who engaged in fraud should be punished. And if there are legitimate questions about who owns a loan, those will need to be resolved before the proceeds of any foreclosure are distributed. But none of that changes the basic reality that there are millions of Americans who took out mortgages they could not support on houses they could not afford. It may be necessary to postpone their day of reckoning for a few months to get the paperwork in order and ensure that all the proper procedures are followed, but the reckoning is inevitable. There may be some good that comes out of this mess. Stretching out the foreclosure process would reduce the number of houses dumped on the market over the next six months, which could help firm up housing prices in the short term and put some extra support under a sagging economy. But everyone should understand that the longer the foreclosure process goes on, the longer it will take for the excess supply of houses to be absorbed, for prices to stabilize and for the real estate market to return to something closer to a normal equilibrium. A moratorium should also put pressure on banks and loan servicers to finally bite the bullet, as many of us suggested they do two years ago, and move more aggressively to restructure problem loans by writing off more of the principal and refinancing what remains at lower interest rates over longer terms. The breakdown in the foreclosure system has also exposed serious weaknesses in the way mortgages are written, packaged and serviced that should force the industry to adopt instruments and structures that are simpler and easier to change when things go wrong. Based on the recent revelations, the consumer protection agency should require that mortgage servicers meet minimal standards of customer service and offer clear procedures for loan modification and third- party adjudication before the foreclosure process can be initiated. If this adds to the price of a loan, so be it. That said, those who are cheerleading for a moratorium should realize they can only push things so far. It would not help the recovery of the economy, or the real estate market, if the foreclosure process became so hopelessly tangled that banks and investors effectively lose the ability to recoup the remaining value of their collateral. That would provide some immediate financial relief to households facing foreclosure, but it would encourage many more homeowners to begin shirking their mortgage payments in the belief that they would also be able to avoid the consequences. The long term consequences of that would be that mortgage rates would be higher and mortgage loans would be smaller and harder to get. Perhaps it is only natural for Americans to take some guilty pleasure in watching as the big banks and Wall Street wizards who created this flawed and complex mortgage machine are hoisted on their own petards. But be careful what you wish for. The financial system is still fragile enough that we may not be able to afford a full helping of revenge. "
1,"When it comes to figuring out how best to ensconce Elizabeth Warren, the much- loved and much-loathed Harvard law professor, as the leader of the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the White House appears to have a dilemma on its hands. For weeks now, administration officials have weighed various options for how to place Warren at the center of shaping the new watchdog, a role she covets and one that President Obama and others have hinted she will play in one way or another. The latest news to stoke the blogosphere and ignite passions on both sides of the aisle is that the White House is considering giving Warren an 'interim' role at the Treasury Department. Such an approach would allow her to oversee the creation of the consumer bureau while circumventing a potentially nasty and prolonged Senate confirmation process. The far-reaching financial overhaul bill passed in July leaves room for the interim option. But that idea has run into resistance on Capitol Hill, even as some Democratic senators have said they would support any effort to get Warren in place. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who shepherded the landmark legislation through the upper chamber, told reporters Tuesday that such a move could jeopardize the credibility of the fledgling consumer bureau and that it would be 'met with a lot of opposition.' Republican Sens. Olympia J. Snowe, Maine, Susan Collins, Maine, and Scott Brown, Mass., each of whom voted for the financial bill and each of them a potential swing vote in any confirmation battle, have urged Obama to insist that any nominee face Senate scrutiny. But going that route poses its own risks, a fact of which White House officials are keenly aware. For starters, dozens of far less controversial nominees than Warren already have languished in the Senate for months. 'I am concerned about all Senate nominations these days,' Obama said at a news conference on Friday. 'I've got people who have been waiting for six months to get confirmed, who nobody has an official objection to and who were voted out of committee unanimously, and I can't get a vote on them,' he said. One notable example: three nominees to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the nominee for the vice chairman of the Fed, are awaiting approval. Dodd said Tuesday that because of limited time and limited appetite, lawmakers might not approve those nominations before leaving town in November. Leaving Warren in a similar position could sideline one of the country's most visible and compelling consumer advocates - presidential nominees traditionally maintain a low public profile - and prevent her from putting her stamp on the new bureau as it takes shape. Even then, it could end badly. Dodd has questioned whether Warren is 'confirmable,' given that many Republicans and financial industry representatives would oppose her confirmation outright. The liberal groups that have lobbied so vehemently for Warren, including a sizable number of Democratic lawmakers, believe that the confirmation process would be a fight worth having. It remains unclear whether the White House agrees. Though highly unlikely, Obama also could use a November recess appointment to put Warren into place, which would allow her to serve into late 2012 without confirmation. Though the betting money is on Warren, other candidates that have emerged for the consumer bureau role include Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael S. Barr and Eugene Kimmelman, a top official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. The new bureau, already being set up by Treasury staffers, will have broad autonomy to write and enforce rules governing credit cards, mortgages and other such loans. Its independent director, once confirmed, will serve a five-year term. White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday that Warren was 'obviously in the mix' for the job and that an interim appointment was 'certainly an option,' though only one of several. 'You can see the options if you just look at the law,' he said, adding that Obama would make an announcement on the post 'very soon.' Administration officials have been saying a decision was coming soon since the day Obama signed the landmark legislation into law. The difficulties surrounding the choice of how to handle that nomination - along with the fervor Warren stokes in supporters and enemies alike - might go a long way in explaining why the wait continues two months later. "
1,"Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, whose bloc won the largest number of seats in Iraq's March 7 elections, warned Wednesday that the country could slide into a sectarian war if the group is shut out of the next government and said the United States should work more aggressively to prevent that happening. Allawi, a secular Shiite who attracted the votes of millions of Sunnis and some Shiites, said in an interview in his Baghdad office that his Iraqiya bloc represents the change Iraqis crave after years of sectarian violence. But he accused the Shiite incumbent prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, of using his power to alter the electoral outcome and preserve the status quo. If the United States and the United Nations do not step up during what is widely expected to be a months-long political vacuum, they will leave behind an unstable nation and region when they depart, he said. Despite his win, Allawi, who wants his old post back, may be left with nothing if Maliki's State of Law bloc joins forces in the next parliament with the Iraqi National Alliance, a mostly religious Shiite coalition. He warned that a religious Shiite government would lead to renewed bloodshed. 'I told them, `Don't embark on this course,' ' Allawi said, referring to a meeting he had with the Shiite alliance. 'It's going to be very dangerous, it's going to be counterproductive, and the backlash will be severe. The whole foundation of whatever infant democracy we've built will be ruined.' Allawi said he has sought to meet with Maliki to discuss the process of forming a government but that no date has been set. U.S. officials have largely restricted their involvement to privately urging leaders to act responsibly as the political jockeying continues, in some cases spilling into the streets. At least 90 people were killed in attacks over a span of five days last month. A significant spike in violence during this critical period could push the country into a regionally destabilizing war, he said. Allawi said that the United States has done little to help bring about goals spelled out under the Bush administration. Those include forging reconciliation through political settlements, amending Iraq's constitution, enacting legislation to regulate the oil industry, and being more judicious about purging loyalists of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party from the government. Sunni leaders say Shiite politicians have used the last to weaken their political clout. 'In the interim _ as America is still here, and as America still enjoys respectability in this country _ they should focus on political reforms and use their offices here to forge reconciliation,' he said. 'There should have been much more criticism of the de-Baathification. All of it was without any foundation.' Allawi's bloc has been the main target of a policy instituted by the United States in 2003 to purge the government of officials loyal to the outlawed Baath Party. The Accountability and Justice Commission, which is run by rival Shiite politicians, purged more than 70 members of the group before the elections and is now trying to remove at least four others. More than 40 members of the group are in jails in Baghdad with no contact with the outside world, he said. At least one victorious Iraqiya candidate is in jail, and four others are the subject of arrest warrants, he added. 'I said to the Americans: `Security is not only a function of the number of troops you have. It's changing the political landscape _ creating reconciliation, implementing reconciliation,' ' Allawi said. On Wednesday, Allawi sent a delegation to neighboring Iran in an effort to garner support from the Islamic republic's leadership, which plays a quiet but crucial role in Iraqi politics, and to say that the Iraqiya bloc would not be its enemy, he said. 'The delegation is there to explain to the Iranians that we are not warmongers and we want a very sound and good relationship with Iran and the rest of the neighbors,' he said. 'But also we are not willing to accept interference in internal matters, just as we don't want to interfere in Iranian internal matters.' "
1,"Tea party favorites Rand Paul and Marco Rubio won their bids for the Senate Tuesday night and Republicans picked off Democratic-held Senate seats in Indiana and Arkansas in early returns that pointed to across-the-board gains for the GOP. Scattered returns from House races suggested Republicans would gain a substantial number of seats. Democrats lost races in Virginia and Indiana and almost three dozen were trailing in very early returns as Republicans set their sights on winning a net of 39 seats needed to claim the majority. Republican candidates were powered by a combination of anxiety over the economy and a significant shift in sentiment among independents, who were critical to President Barack Obama's 2008 victory and to the Democrats' takeover of Congress just four years ago. Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., was the first senate incumbent to fall, losing to Rep. John Boozman R-Ark. Lincoln survived a tough primary in the spring, but was the underdog throughout the general election. In Kentucky, Paul easily defeated state attorney general Jack Conway, while in Indiana, former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., scored an equally easy victory over Democratic Rep. Brad Ellsworth, D-Ind. Republicans also held their Senate seat in Ohio, where former Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, cruised past Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher. One of the most prominent of tea party Republicans, Christine O'Donnell, lost her bid for the Senate in Delaware, as Democrat Chris Coons held the seat once occupied by Vice President Joe Biden. In New Hampshire, state attorney general Kelly Ayotte won her race in another GOP-occupied seat. In one of the pivotal races, Democratic West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin held an early lead over Republican businessman John Raese. A Manchin victory would create a huge obstacle to the GOP's hopes of capturing the Senate. With the unemployment rate at 9.6 percent, economic issues dominated the voters' agenda Tuesday. More than six in 10 called the economy their top concern, according to preliminary national exit poll data. About nine in 10 see the economy as in bad shape and more than three times as many said they believe the economy is getting worse rather than better. About half of all voters said they were 'very worried' about the national economy and most of them were backing Republican House candidates this year. Just 44 percent of voters said they approved of Obama's performance as president, according to preliminary findings, with 55 percent saying they disapprove. Significantly more voters said their vote was a message of opposition to the president than a sign of support - 37 percent to 24 percent. The early exit polls showed how dramatically the makeup of the electorate has changed since Obama's victory two years ago. There were far fewer young voters - 10 percent Tuesday compared with 18 percent in 2008 - and the number of minority voters also declined. This development occurred despite a concerted effort by Obama and other leading Democrats to motivate those groups. Tuesday's electorate was also more conservative. In the preliminary data, conservatives made up 41 percent of all voters, up from 34 percent in 2008 and 32 percent in 2006. If that held up, it would represent the highest share of conservatives in exit polls back to 1972. The biggest switchup this year is among independents, with these swing voters favoring GOP House candidates by a sweeping 17-point margin. Four years ago, independents broke for the Democrats by a similarly wide margin. Democrats faced daunting odds from the start of the 2010 campaign - the president's party almost always loses seats in the first midterm and the party's gains in 2006 and 2008 increased the likelihood of a Republican bounce back. But as the election gathered force, the possibility of significant GOP gains grew. Since the end of World War II, there have been five midterm elections in which the president's party lost more than 40 seats. Democrats lost 66 seats in 1966, 56 seats in 1946 and 52 seats in 1994. Republicans lost 49 seats in 1958 and 43 in 1974. Republicans ran against the Obama agenda and, in many competitive districts, Democrats ran away from it. Republicans sought to nationalize the election as a referendum on the president, while Democrats preferred to make House races a choice between individual candidates. The campaign included high drama and low farce, a year in which virtually nothing seemed off limits, whether it was talk of witches, whores, mob bankers, liars or an Aqua Buddha. The term 'extremist' - thrown about with great frequency - seemed almost mild by comparison. The primaries included a series of surprises, especially on the Republican side. In half a dozen states, insurgent conservatives, many backed by tea party activists, upset establishment Republican candidates. More incumbents lost primaries than in any year since 2002, but the number - three senators, four House members and one governor - was still relatively modest. One of the first to fall was Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who never made it through his party's convention process. A conservative senator, Bennett was punished for his vote in favor of the Trouble Asset Relief Program that bailed out financial institutions and for his willingness to work across party lines. But one of those senators who lost a primary, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, subsequently mounted a write-in campaign and was in the thick of the battle as the polls opened on Tuesday. If there was a defining symbol of the 2010 campaign, it was that of the tea party, a loose confederation of conservative activists who both energized and shook up the Republican Party. The tea party movement first raised its banner in the spring of 2009, protesting what its supporters saw as a dangerous expansion of government's intervention in the economy and a crippling rise in the federal deficit and national debt. Over time, Republican leaders found themselves trying to harness the best of the movement's energy while defending against what Democrats quickly labeled the extreme views of many of the tea party's favored candidates. The campaign for control of the House played out on one of the largest battlefields seen in modern times, with roughly 100 districts considered mildly to extremely competitive. Virtually all those districts were in Democratic hands as the day began. Many of those districts, however, were on relatively friendly terrain for the Republicans. Overall, there were 48 House districts in Democratic hands that were also won by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the 2008 presidential race. Of those, 43 were considered competitive. Freshman and sophomore Democrats were especially vulnerable, as many had won in swing or marginal districts in a pair of elections in which Republicans suffered severe losses. The GOP's magic number to take back control was a net gain of 39 seats, which was identical to the number of Democrats who won in 2006 or later and were in some degree of jeopardy. The battle for the Senate played out in both swing states and in states that tilted toward the Democrats, making the Republican challenge of picking up a net of 10 seats all the more difficult. Republicans were seeking to take Democratic seats in purple or even blue states, such as Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, Colorado, Nevada, Washington and California. The 2010 campaign was long, ugly and costly. Total spending, which includes that of candidates, Republican and Democratic Party committees and outside groups, approached $4 billion, by some estimates. Much of that came from unaffiliated groups who were not required by law to disclose their donors. That became a major point of controversy as Obama and other Democrats warned against the infusion of secret money from corporations and special interests influencing the outcome of the election and potentially the shape of new legislation next year. The outside money played a major role in many of the most competitive states, including those in Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Washington. Negative ads flooded television screens in states and districts with competitive races, sometimes so many that it was all a viewer could do to try to watch them. Democrats concluded early in the campaign that their best hope of preventing sizeable losses was to demonize Republican challengers. But Republicans, through their party committees, engaged in just as many negative attacks. Polling director Jon Cohen and staff researcher Alice Crites contributed to this report. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: We wrote this month about the deficit reduction blueprint issued by the co- chairs of President Obama's fiscal responsibility commission. Now comes a second plan, released last Wednesday, that differs in key respects and also merits close study. The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) proposal, overseen by Democrat Alice Rivlin and Republican Pete Domenici, demonstrates that reasonable people in both political parties, if not elected officials, can agree on a deficit reduction plan: The 19-member bipartisan task force included not only Ms. Rivlin, who served as President Clinton's budget director, and Mr. Domenici, a former Republican senator from New Mexico, but also Republicans such as former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez and Democrats such as former Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard and Clinton Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros. The similarities of the two proposals bear emphasizing because they underscore the likely path should the president and Congress decide to stop bemoaning the debt and start doing something about it. Both rely on spending cuts and tax increases, although the BPC would split the two about evenly while the plan outlined by the commission co-chairs, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, would rely on a three-to-one ratio of spending cuts to tax increases. Both would lower marginal tax rates by reducing or eliminating hundreds of billions in tax breaks. Both would treat the value of employer-sponsored health insurance as taxable income, helping put a brake on rising health-care costs. Both put yearly caps on defense spending and domestic programs. One major difference is that the BPC plan attempts to stimulate the economy with a one-year payroll tax holiday for 2011, eliminating the 12.4 percent tax that employers and employees pay jointly into the Social Security trust fund. This would cost a lot but, the group says, create 2.5 million to 7 million new jobs as the cost of hiring a new employee is reduced and workers spend money from fatter paychecks. The plan would credit the lost $650 billion in revenue to the Social Security trust fund and save enough elsewhere to make up the difference. Another key distinction is that the BPC, in addition to overhauling the tax code, would add a 6.5 percent tax on goods and services. This consumption tax, in place in every other major world economy, represents a better way to encourage savings and investment than taxing income. A broad-based consumption tax, including food and clothing, can be unfair to low- and middle-income families, but the plan offsets the effect with refundable credits to low-income families for children and earnings. Such a tax should be an element of future discussions. The BPC plan would have government spend 23 percent of the gross domestic product rather than the 21 percent level of the Bowles-Simpson plan. Given rising health costs and an aging population, even getting to 23 percent - the current level is 26 percent - is going to require sacrifice. No task force can supply what is missing from both proposals: political will to get the plan enacted. The coming months will show whether that will exists, from President Obama or members of Congress. "
1,"Defending champion Wolfsburg kept pace with the top teams in the Bundesliga with a 2-1 home victory against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Alexander Madlung scored for Wolfsburg in first-half injury time and Christian Gentner made it 2-0 two minutes into second-half stoppage time. A minute later, Michael Bradley scored a consolation goal for Moenchengladbach. The win gives Armin Veh's Wolfsburg side 16 points in fifth place, five points behind leader Bayer Leverkusen. 'It wasn't a good game for us. 'Gladbach made things difficult for us, not letting us get through,' Wolfsburg midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic said. 'It wasn't a convincing game, but what's important was that we won the game. 'The first goal was extremely important, letting us go into the locker room ahead 1-0. And we should have scored the second goal earlier to ease things. But in the end we survived.' The win could have been more comfortable but Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko twice hit the woodwork in the first half. Moenchengladbach lost its fifth straight game and six of the last seven to remain in 17th place with seven points. Wolfsburg took the lead with Madlung's header before Gentner's 11-meter (yard) shot extended the lead. Moenchengladbach didn't give up with Bradley pulling a goal back, but there wasn't enough time to try and equalize. 'We had a very good away match,' Moenchengladbach defender Tobias Levels said. 'We stood very well defensively the entire game and had our chances, but we just didn't use them. And they beat us on two mistakes in injury time.' In Sunday's late game, Borussia Dortmund celebrated a second straight victory after beating Bochum 2-0 at home, courtesy of goals from Lucas Barrios in the 20th minute and Neven Subotic after 51 minutes. Dortmund, who scored more than one goal in a Bundesliga game for the first time this season, moved on to 12 points in 10th place. Bochum, who saw Diego Klimowicz hit the post with nine minutes left, are 16th in the standings with just eight points after one win in their last six matches. "
1,"The highest court in military-ruled Myanmar dismissed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's latest bid for freedom Friday, turning down an appeal to end 14 years of house arrest, her lawyer said. The Supreme Court's decision had been expected since legal rulings in Myanmar rarely favor opposition activists, and the junta appears determined to keep Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, detained through elections planned later this year. Defense lawyer Nyan Win told reporters he would launch one final 'special appeal' before the court after determining why the recent appeal had been rejected. 'The court order did not mention any reasons,' he said. 'Although the decision comes as no surprise, it is deeply disappointing,' said British Ambassador Andrew Heyn, who attended the court session along with diplomats from Australia, France and the United States. 'We continue to believe that (Suu Kyi) should be released immediately along with the other 2,000 and more other prisoners of conscience.' French Ambassador Jean Pierre Lafosse said Suu Kyi was 'the victim of a sham trial.' Suu Kyi's lawyers appealed to the court last November after a lower court a month earlier upheld a decision to sentence her to 18 months of house arrest. She was convicted last August of violating the terms of her previous detention by briefly sheltering an American who swam uninvited to her lakeside home. The 64-year-old democracy icon was initially sentenced to three years in prison with hard labor in a trial that drew global condemnation, but that sentence was commuted to 18 months of house arrest by junta chief Senior Gen. Than Shwe. Suu Kyi has been detained for 14 years. Her National League for Democracy won elections in 1990 by a landslide, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, refused to cede power. The junta has announced it will hold elections some time this year under a constitution that allows the military to maintain substantial power. It effectively bars Suu Kyi from participating in the polls, the first general elections since 1990. Suu Kyi's party has not announced whether it will contest the elections. If the vote goes ahead as planned and Suu Kyi serves out her latest 18-month sentence, she would still be in detention during the elections. The court ruling also denied freedom to two female companions who share Suu Kyi's house arrest. It comes nearly two weeks after the junta released Tin Oo, the 82-year-old deputy leader of Suu Kyi's party, from nearly seven years in detention. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been widely criticized for its continued violation of human rights, including atrocities committed by its military against ethnic minority groups. Human rights groups say the junta holds 2,100 political prisoners. The Singapore government, which normally refrains from criticizing the junta, said 'it is of course very disappointing that her appeal did not succeed.' It said a dialogue among the junta, Suu Kyi and all other political groups ahead of this year's elections 'offers the best prospects for national reconciliation and the long-term political stability of Myanmar.' 'We thus hope that the Myanmar authorities will, in their own interests, allow her to participate in the political process in a meaningful way as soon as possible,' it said in a statement. During a meeting with her lawyers Thursday, Suu Kyi jokingly asked them if she had been behaving well, as junta chief Than Shwe had said she could receive amnesty if she serves her time according to the prescribed regulations. 'Than Shwe already made the verdict for (Suu Kyi) and no judge will have the nerve to change it,' said Aung Din, executive director of the U.S.-based U.S. Campaign for Burma, a lobby group. 'The judiciary system in Burma is just a part of the regime's oppressive mechanism,' he said. 'The only way to make the release of (Suu Kyi) and all political prisoners in Burma is to keep putting maximum pressure on Than Shwe and his cronies until they feel the heat.' "
1,"Most of the energy we use in this country comes from sources far beneath the Earth's surface called fossil fuels. Petroleum (which is used to make oil and gasoline), natural gas and coal formed deep underground over hundreds of millions of years. These deposits were created as once-living plants and animals decomposed under high pressure and heat. Humans have created sophisticated ways to get these fuels out of the earth, and they now account for more than 80 percent of all the energy Americans use to heat our homes, cook food and drive our cars. But someday, these deposits of fossil fuels will run out. So experts want to come up with alternative sources of energy that are 'renewable,' which means they won't run out. Here are a couple of interesting renewable energy sources that have been growing quickly. Wind power: Do you remember seeing old grain windmills on a field trip or in storybooks? They used the wind to move giant blades, and as they turned, huge gears inside the windmill operated grain-crushing machinery. Modern windmills, called wind turbines, are used to generate electricity. Rather than turning grain machinery, the gears attached to a wind turbine's rotors move wires inside a magnetic field, which causes an electric charge to form in the wire. Constant movement of these wires creates an electric current that can be used to power homes and businesses. Companies are now building huge wind farms, but they can be placed only in areas that are consistently windy. Wind power now accounts for 1.5 percent of all electricity used around the world, and many more wind farms are planned. Garbage fuel: Most of the trash we throw out ends up in landfills _ huge, rotting piles of garbage. As this waste rots over time, it lets off a gas called methane, which is the main ingredient in natural gas. Companies are building plants that capture the methane from garbage dumps and use it to manufacture natural gas. When chilled to extremely low temperatures, natural gas turns into liquid, which takes up far less space and is easier to move around. In California, the trash collecting company Waste Management has built the largest plant in the world for turning methane from landfills into liquid natural gas. That fuel is then used to power hundreds of the company's garbage trucks. There's another benefit to this technology: Methane contributes to global warming, so this process keeps it from seeping into the atmosphere from the garbage dump. There are more than 500 landfills in the nation trying to recycle waste into energy. It's expensive to do, but experts say it will become cheaper as more companies do it and the technology improves.

1,"A federal judge has sentenced former Democratic fundraiser Norman Hsu to more than 24 years in prison for violating campaign finance laws. Hsu was sentenced Tuesday at a federal court in Manhattan. His donations became an embarrassment for Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign. His arrest led Clinton to return more than $800,000 to donors linked to Hsu. Prosecutors say Hsu obtained millions of dollars from investors by claiming clothing or high-technology ventures would pay returns of 14 and 20 percent. Instead, he spent the money on himself. Hsu's decade-long Ponzi scheme collapsed in September 2007. "
1,"Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is demanding that Google provide his office with information about any data the company collected from the state's residents and businesses without permission. Google is coming under fire from regulators worldwide over whether the company violated people's privacy with its data collection practices. The company said last month it mistakenly gathered information from open wireless networks while it was capturing images of streets and houses for its Street View service, a product that lets users view photographs of an area online. 'Consumers and businesses rightly expect Google to respect their privacy, not invade it by vacuuming up confidential data,' Blumenthal said in a statement e-mailed from his office Monday. If personal data was collected from Internet connections, Google may have broken privacy laws, he said. The attorney general's office sent a letter to Google on May 27 requesting the data and asked that the company respond within 10 days of receiving it. The letter, addressed to Google's deputy general counsel Matt Sucherman, asked for the time period that the company's Street View cars collected information from wireless networks in Connecticut and for the names of affected towns. The state also asked for information on Google's data collection equipment and why it gathered information from Web connections. 'We're working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns,' Christine Chen, a spokeswoman for Google, said in an e-mailed statement. An Oregon judge has ordered the company turn over similar data collected there, including any e-mails, files or digital phone records, according to court documents. Google is also giving data to regulators in Germany, France and Spain. The Federal Trade Commission has said it will take a 'very, very close look' at Google's data gathering.

1,"You could forgive your digital camera for feeling some of the same anxiety a film camera might have suffered eight years ago. Just as the 35mm model of 2002 was threatened even by the limited capabilities of contemporary digital cameras, today's point-and-shoot digital models risk being displaced by the cameras in many new smartphones. Yes, a phone's camera cannot match the resolution of even midrange dedicated cameras. It's also likely to trip on high-contrast scenery, leaving purple fringes at the boundaries of dark and light areas. But a phone's already something that most people carry everywhere. And any Internet-connected phone will let you share pictures on the go. What can digital cameras do to stay ahead? Two new high-end models, Panasonic's DMC-ZS7, $400, and Samsung's HZ35W, $350, try an all-of-the-above approach. Each offers zoom lenses with wide-angle and telephoto reach, Global Positioning System receivers to 'geotag' photos, high-definition video recording, a choice of point-and-shoot or manual modes, and a bundle of in-camera editing tools. Some of these bonus features even justify the high prices of these cameras. The most unambiguous benefit comes from the powerful zoom lenses on these two: 12x on the Panasonic, 14x on the Samsung. From three tiers above the first-base line at Nationals Park, each camera could easily zoom in to fill most of the frame with the batter, the catcher and the umpire. (Their optical image stabilization systems then kept the shot steady.) Or I could zoom all the way out to capture the entire span of the outfield, plus a generous spread of seats on either side. Yet each camera measures about 1.3 inches thick with its lens retracted, compact enough for many pockets. The benefits of GPS capability aren't as clear. All cameras suffer a performance lag compared with phones, which can use nearby wireless signals to approximate their position quickly. (Eye-Fi's Explore SD Card, which records nearby WiFi signals for later matching up with a database of WiFi signals , worked faster for the same reason.) Without that acceleration, a loaner Panasonic model needed as long as 10 minutes to find itself, and it sometimes mistakenly tagged photos with an earlier location. At other times, it needed only a minute to fix its position. The Samsung lent by the company's PR department exhibited a different issue: Its GPS never worked at all. The onscreen indicator never turned from red to green, no matter how long or where I tested it. A Samsung representative said the company hadn't heard of this issue, but users on the popular Digital Photography Review site reported the same problem. Weirdly enough, in the Samsung's map-viewing mode GPS did appear to work, placing me within a few blocks of my spot in downtown Washington. The Panasonic can also set its own clock from the GPS signal, but only if you click through several settings menus. The Samsung can't do that. To use these geotags _ say, if you want to remember what you were looking at a year after the vacation _ you will need a program that reads them. Apple's iPhoto and Google's Picasa can do that; Microsoft's Windows Live Photo Gallery won't. These cameras also provide dozens of picture-taking modes: 29 scene options on the Panasonic, 13 on the Samsung (including presets for sunset and dawn photography). But the most useful mode on each is a fully automatic option that has the camera pick the right mode based on the scenery _ for example, switching to macro when you close to within a few inches of a subject. These models also offer numerous in-camera editing functions, for which I see no point. As long as you have to copy the photos to a computer to share them, why not use a regular program there? Cameras still have a comfortable lead on phones in terms of video recording, but their real competition there isn't phones anyway _ it's Flip camcorders and other simplified video devices. So although the Panasonic and the Samsung recorded some decent, sort-of high-def video (the former's looked a bit sharper and brighter), copying those clips to a computer for editing and sharing was a lot more complicated than it would have been on a Flip. It didn't help that the Panasonic stores some video clips in a folder labeled 'PRIVATE.' Both cameras also commit unnecessary usability fouls. Each comes set to beep obnoxiously every time you do anything and use proprietary USB connectors. The Panasonic's settings menus are woefully cluttered. The Samsung can't automatically rotate pictures taken holding the camera sideways. Even with those glitches, these cameras do verify that the simplest way to compete with phones is _ surprise! _ to take better pictures. But that will work only if we haven't already been conditioned to accept blurry, unfocused cameraphone shots as the real thing. "
1,"Banks may expand their short-term lending at interest rates of 120 percent or more as they seek to replace more than $15 billion in lost revenue because of regulations limiting overdraft fees. 'The smarter banks are trying to resell overdraft protection to consumers as a different product,' said Elizabeth Rowe, group director of banking advisory services at Mercator Advisory Group in Maynard, Mass. Banks including Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., the fourth-largest U.S. bank, and U.S. Bancorp, based in Minneapolis, are already making such loans, usually from $100 to $500, at annual rates of 120 percent if repaid in 30 days. They're known as 'checking advance products.' That puts them in competition with so-called payday loan stores, which make loans with similar terms to customers who generally don't have credit cards to bridge the gap until the check comes, according to Rowe, whose firm advises banks. The banks don't call the advances payday loans because it's a 'very tarnished, negative brand,' said Rowe, who estimates U.S. banks may lose from $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue when Federal Reserve rules take effect July 1. The rules will prohibit banks from charging overdraft fees at automated teller machines or on debit cards unless a customer has agreed to pay for exceeding account balances. For consumers, getting a short-term, high-interest loan from a bank might be worse than going to a payday store, said Lauren Saunders, managing attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in Washington. A bank has direct access to consumer accounts, meaning its loans will be paid off first, ahead of food, housing or utilities, she said. 'They're looking for ways of replacing their overdraft income,' Saunders said. 'Instead of pricing their products openly and up-front, they seem addicted to back-end ways of making profits.' The Center has represented plaintiffs in lawsuits against banks and hasn't filed any lawsuits over the loan programs, Saunders said. Banks caution customers that the loans are an expensive form of credit. Alternatives 'may be more suitable to your long-term needs,' says a statement on Fifth Third's Web site. At U.S. Bancorp, customers using 'Checking Account Advance' may borrow from $20 up to a preset limit. The fee is $10 for each $100 borrowed. Loans are repaid from the account's next direct deposit. Wells Fargo's 'Direct Deposit Advance Service' works the same way and allows a line of credit of up to $500. The bank, one of the two biggest U.S. home lenders in 2009, has been offering the loans since 1994. The advance is less expensive than a payday loan, and the bank's policies ensure customers don't use it as a long-term solution, said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick. 'Wells Fargo encourages all our customers to properly manage their accounts,' Messick said. 'Emergencies do arise, and our Direct Deposit Advance Service can help customers when they're in a financial bind.' Fifth Third, Ohio's largest lender, began offering 'Early Access' loans in September 2008, before the current debate on overdraft fees and the Fed announced its opt-in rules, bank spokeswoman Stephanie Honan said. The bank offers the advances only to existing customers with checking accounts in good standing. 'Our product fully complies with all applicable state and federal banking regulations,' said Honan. U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman Teri Charest declined to comment. National banks making payday-type loans unfairly compete with payday loan stores because they're exempt from state laws limiting interest rates, said Steven Schlein, spokesman for the Community Financial Services Association of America, an Alexandria, Va.-based trade association, which represents payday lenders. National banks like Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Fifth Third are federally regulated, while payday lenders are overseen by the states. 'What the banks are doing are payday loans,' Schlein said. 'Let's have everybody operate under the same system.' The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has made banking access for low-income consumers a priority, agency spokesman David Barr said. A December FDIC survey found there were 17 million U.S. adults with no bank accounts and 43 million 'underbanked,' meaning they may have a checking or savings account yet rely on financial services such as payday loans. The FDIC launched a pilot program in 2008 to encourage banks to make loans up to $1,000 with interest rates at 36 percent or less, the agency said. Thirty-one banks participated in the first year, making 16,000 loans for a total of $18.5 million. Payday stores and Internet lenders make about $42.1 billion in loans a year, according to Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark.-based investment bank and financial research firm. Lenders earned about $7.3 billion on fees from those loans, according to the company. Large banks are looking at the payday loan market because several states have restricted or banned the loans, said Mike Moebs, an industry analyst based in Lake Bluff, Illinois. Ohio passed a law in 2008 limiting payday loan interest to 28 percent. 'If you step in and eliminate the payday lender, someone has to fill that void,' Moebs said. Consumer groups oppose payday loans whether they're being made by a bank or a payday lender, said Jean Ann Fox of the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America. Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Fifth Third's cash advance products are structured exactly like payday loans, she said. 'If you have a balloon-payment loan for more money than people can pay at one time, at triple-digit interest rates, secured by direct access to your bank account, that's a recipe for a debt trap,' Fox said. Legislation pending in Congress would exceed the Fed's rules, limiting banks to one overdraft fee a month or six a year. Banks collected about $38 billion in overdraft fees last year, said Michael Flores, a management consultant whose clients include Citigroup Inc. and Wachovia Corp. He said the loss of revenue from the rules may be from $10 billion to $15 billion a year. Banks trying to get into the payday loan business face high overhead costs, said Flores, the management consultant. It's difficult for banks to make money on loans under $500, he said. Regulatory requirements may mean waiting a day or two for the loan, when a payday lender in a neighborhood store may give out the money in 30 minutes, Flores said. There are consumers who just don't like banks, said Rowe of Mercator, whose clients include the largest U.S. banks, such as Bank of America Corp., Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Consumers don't like to ask bank tellers behind a glass screen for personal help, she said. 'There's an awful moment when they have to come to a teller,' Rowe said. 'It's the most unwelcoming moment. It's absolutely terrifying.' "
1,"The International Hockey Federation wants to boost its income before the 2016 Olympics by cashing in on the sport's popularity in India. Field hockey's ruling executive meets this week to study a six-year plan that aims to raise the game's profile by using its biggest fan base. Christophe Troendle, the FIH's director-general, says field hockey is part of the culture of India which has 1.1 billion people. The FIH hopes that targeting sponsors and staging more top events in India could help triple its annual budget of 5 million Swiss francs ($5 million; &#8264;llion). New revenue from India would also reduce the governing body's dependence on the International Olympic Committee, which provides 40 per cent of its income. "
1,"The San Antonio Spurs saw off their stiffest test yet to extend their NBA winning streak to 11 games with a 106-97 victory over the Orlando Magic on Monday. Tony Parker had 24 points and 10 assists, while Manu Ginobili had 25 points for the Spurs, who have an NBA-best record of 12-1. It is the longest winning streak in nearly three years for the Spurs, who have taken a training-camp goal of a fast start far beyond what they had in mind. The Magic, meanwhile, were perhaps in search of a litmus test after just one of their nine wins this season have come against a team with a winning record. The Spurs can thank their long-range shooting for keeping this streak going. San Antonio made 12 of 19 from behind the 3-point line, including all five attempts in the fourth quarter. Dwight Howard had 26 points and 18 rebounds for the East Conference-leading Magic, whose own winning streak ended at four. Celtics 99, Hawks 76 In Atlanta, Boston raced to a 26-point lead in the first quarter and went on to rout Atlanta. The Hawks missed five of its first six shots, and Boston had a double-digit lead before the game was 4 minutes old. At 13-3, Atlanta coach Larry Drew called the first of three timeouts in the opening quarter in a desperate attempts to slow the Celtics. Nothing worked. Boston made 18 of 25 shots, the Hawks just 4 of 17 and it was 39-13 at the end of the first. Boston's Nate Robinson had 16 points and 10 assists filling in for Rajon Rondo, who missed the game with a hamstring strain. Mike Bibby led the Hawks with 11 points. Pacers 93, Heat 77 In Miami, the hosts' week of woe continued as Dwayne Wade had his worst-ever shooting game and Indiana recorded a comfortable win. Wade finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting. He had never shot so poorly when taking at least 13 tries, and the point total was the third-lowest of his career. He has been held scoreless twice. Danny Granger had 20 points and 11 rebounds and Brandon Rush added 20 points for the Pacers, who took control with a 29-11 run in the second quarter. LeBron James scored 25 points and Chris Bosh had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Miami, which learned earlier Monday that top reserve Udonis Haslem will need surgery to repair a torn foot ligament and be out indefinitely. Thunder 117, Timberwolves 107 In Oklahoma City, Kevin Durant and Jeff Green returned from injuries and powered Oklahoma City to its fifth consecutive victory, beating Minnesota. Durant scored 28 points and Green had 24, including a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute. Green missed the previous four games with a sprained left ankle and Durant, who came in averaging an NBA-best 28 points, was out for two games with a left ankle sprain. Kevin Love had 24 points and 17 rebounds for Minnesota. Oklahoma City led by as many as 18 in the second half, but the Timberwolves put together an impressive rally to take a six-point lead with less than 7 minutes to go. Jazz 94, Kings 83 In Salt Lake City, C.J. Miles scored 20 points to help Utah beat Sacramento. After hitting five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter in a comeback win over Portland on Saturday, Miles keyed two runs that gave the Jazz their third win in the past four starts. Al Jefferson scored 19 points for the Jazz, who have won more road games (six) than any other team, but came into this one with a mediocre home-court record. DeMarcus Cousins had 18 points to lead Sacramento, which suffered its eighth loss in its past nine games. The Kings had only 56 points after three quarters. Suns 123, Rockets 116 In Houston, Steve Nash had 24 points and nine assists to help Phoenix snap a three-game losing streak with a win over Houston. Nash played 37 minutes, showing no lingering effects from the groin injury that sidelined him for the Suns' previous two games. Jason Richardson scored 26 points for the Suns. Kevin Martin scored 19 to lead the Rockets, who've lost four in a row. Houston played its sixth straight game without Yao Ming, who's out with a bone bruise in his left ankle. "
1,"Guinea's military strongman, hospitalized in Morocco with a gunshot wound, is alert and in possession of his mental faculties, the country's foreign minister said Monday as he tried to tamp down speculation that Capt. Moussa 'Dadis' Camara is badly hurt. Alexandre Cece Loua told The Associated Press he has spoken with Camara in the hospital and called his condition 'encouraging.' Few details have emerged about the nature of Camara's wounds since he was shot in an assassination attempt in Guinea on Thursday. The future of the bauxite-rich African nation has seemed as uncertain as the health of Camara, who seized power in a coup a year ago. The commander of the presidential guard who allegedly shot Camara is on the run. Camara's departure means Guinea potentially faces a dangerous power vacuum. 'I saw him, I spoke to him, he answered me, all this shows that he retains his mental faculties,' Loua told AP in the Moroccan capital, Rabat. 'He recognizes his entourage. His breathing is not assisted.' Earlier Monday, Loua told France's RFI radio that Camara was not yet able to have a conversation. Speaking to the AP later, Loua played down concerns about Camara's physical and mental faculties. But a retired diplomat in Guinea who is close to the junta said a bullet sent a splinter of bone from Camara's skull into his brain and that he had to undergo a three- to four-hour-long operation. Camara was flown to Morocco Friday, where he was operated on for cranial trauma at a military hospital. 'There has been no estimate for ... how long it will be before he returns,' Loua said. 'He is responding well to the treatment he has been prescribed and there is no worry over his life.' Loua could not say if there were any plans for Camara to address the country, where there are fears of further coups and even civil war. In Guinea's capital, Conakry, Communications Minister Idrissa Cherif said he does not know if 'the boss will come back Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday -- or when.' Cherif said Camara's return 'is up to his doctors.' He continued to insist Camara 'is doing well' and has resumed his official functions from his hospital room. Gunfire broke out Sunday evening after state TV announced a toll-free number where citizens could call if they had information about the alleged would-be assassin, Abubakar 'Toumba' Diakite. The junta launched a nationwide manhunt for him and the presidential guard force Diakite once commanded searched passing cars. Gen. Sekouba Konate, the vice president of the military junta, has taken charge in Camara's absence. In September, the presidential guard opened fire on unarmed demonstrators who had gathered to demand that Camara step aside, killing at least 157. A coalition of opposition and civil society leaders gathered to discuss possible next steps. Many say they doubt elections scheduled for January will go forward as planned. They had feared Camara would run as a candidate. 'The first thing we need to know is the state of his health,' said opposition leader Jean Marie Dore. 'Is he going to recover? And if he recovers, will he be able to resume his functions? Once we get some clarity on that, then we can start formulating a way forward.' France's Foreign Ministry on Monday called for calm in Guinea. The junta has also laid waste to the country's economy, already one of the poorest in Africa even though it has half the world's reserves of bauxite, the raw material used to make aluminum. ---- Associated Press writer Rukmini Callimachi in Conakry, Guinea contributed to this report.

1,"For the past year, I've been warning that the imbalances underlying the financial crisis _ the explosive growth of credit, the mispricing of risk, the mispricing of real estate and other assets, the overcapacity in the global economy _ were so huge that a quick and easy economic recovery was highly unlikely. And for much of that time, it has looked as though I was dead wrong. Stocks rebounded, credit markets revived, corporate profits returned and bank balance sheets have been repaired. But the nagging suspicion is that too much of this rebound is the result of the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus that not only did its job of reversing what was a dangerous downward spiral, but also made it possible for many countries to delay dealing with those fundamental economic imbalances. No better proof exists than the financial drama now unfolding in Western Europe, where for many years countries from Ireland to Greece used the financial cover offered by a new continental currency to overspend, overborrow and overexpand. In the case of Greece, the government took on so much debt during the bubble years that there is almost no way out of its predicament. If Athens manages to make good on its promises to cut spending and turn a nation of tax cheats into taxpayers, there's a good chance it will trigger a vicious deflationary spiral _ falling prices, falling employment and falling government revenue _ that will make it impossible to repay debts. Or Greece could renege on its promises and find itself shut off from further borrowing. Either path leads to some sort of default. The story is somewhat different in other countries, albeit with similar consequences. In Spain and Ireland, the problem is not so much government debt but rather all the private debt used to fuel massive real estate bubbles. Now that those bubbles have burst, the banks that lent that money are facing such huge losses that they have had to be bailed out by the government (in the case of Ireland) or may soon have to be (in the case of Spain). And the ensuing recession has now cut so deeply into tax revenue that even the heretofore fiscally responsible governments of these two countries are now finding it difficult and expensive to borrow new money or refinance existing debt when it comes due. Compounding the problem is that much of this troubled debt, both public and private, is now in the hands of Europe's biggest banks, many of which were already too thinly capitalized and weakened by losses from soured U.S. investments. For European leaders, the decision to finally come through with a $145 billion rescue package for Greece represented a calculated decision that it was less painful, financially and politically, to rescue a profligate neighbor than to rescue their own bankers. Indeed, the problem with European leaders' response to this crisis has been that their exaggerated concerns about appearances have led them to reject useful strategies. It was out of concern for appearances that the European Union initially rejected the idea of allowing the International Monetary Fund to offer an early rescue package for Greece, only to finally relent when the run on Greek bonds turned into a rout. It was out of concern for appearances that the European Central Bank announced sternly several weeks back that it would not allow European banks to borrow by using downgraded Greek bonds as collateral, and that it would never use its balance sheet to monetize Greek debt. This week, however, the ECB began accepting Greece's bonds, now junk, as collateral while hinting that it is open to buying even more on the secondary market. It is now with the same misguided determination that some European officials have tried to shut down any discussion of a restructuring of Greece's debt, or that of any other eurozone country, on the theory that a default for one would be a default for them all. In fact, markets are fully capable of distinguishing between the finances of different countries that may use the same currency, just as they can distinguish the bonds of the state of California from those of Utah. And although any country that defaults will surely face the prospect of being shut out of credit markets for years, that punishment is no different than what was meted out in the past to countries such as Greece and Italy, when they were free to escape financial predicaments by repaying their debts in devalued currency. With the Greek credit crisis quickly turning into a eurozone-wide liquidity crisis, European leaders would be well advised to forget about appearances and come up with an acceptable mechanism for the orderly restructuring of sovereign debt. For just as 'too big to fail' has proven a lousy strategy for banks, it is just as lousy when applied to countries, in both cases encouraging incaution on the part of lenders and profligacy and risk-taking on the part of borrowers. While a debt restructuring would be painful for Greece and its European bankers, it would surely be less painful than a decade of austerity-induced recession. And while a Greek default would probably lead to higher borrowing costs for some eurozone neighbors, that's precisely the sort of post-bubble repricing of risk that is necessary to restore confidence in global markets, rebalance the global economy and provide the foundation necessary for sustainable long-term growth.

1,"Federal regulators decided against raising the fees that banks pay to insure deposits after determining the losses from bank failures this year were lower than anticipated. The board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. voted Tuesday to cancel a scheduled fee increase and instead proposed a new plan for ensuring that the insurance fund, now in deficit, reaches the level mandated by Congress. The decision was made after the FDIC staff provided a new estimate of $52 billion in losses from 2010 to 2014. That's down from a previous projection of $60 billion. The financial overhaul law enacted last summer mandates that the insurance fund be restored to at least 1.35 percent of total insured bank deposits by 2020. With 297 banks having failed since the start of 2008, the fund was in the red by $20.7 billion as of June 30 and was at 0.28 percent of total deposits. The FDIC on Tuesday proposed setting a goal of 2 percent for the fund by 2027. The board also proposed to end a policy that allowed banks to receive rebates when the insurance fund reaches healthy levels. Instead, the proposal would reduce the fees when the fund hits those levels. The FDIC opened the proposal to public comment for 30 days; it could be formally adopted sometime after that. 'I am pleased that we are able to provide some (insurance fee) relief now in light of our lower loss projections,' FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said. 'While it is difficult to make long-term projections, we are trying to give the industry greater certainty regarding what rates will be over the long run.' The fee increase that was canceled, which was to have taken effect Jan. 1, was 3 cents for every $100 of a bank's insured deposits. Last year, for the first time, the FDIC required banks to prepay three years' worth of insurance fees. The new premiums came on top of a special emergency fee that took effect in mid-2009. Smaller banks protested the new fees. They said they were being penalized for risky moves made by larger banks that led to the financial crisis. Besides the insurance fund, the FDIC had about $44 billion in cash available in reserve as of June 30 to cover losses at failed banks. "
1,"U.S. stocks are closing lower as uncertainty builds ahead of report on the labor market. Slightly better news on claims for unemployment insurance gave stocks an early lift Thursday, but the gains faded quickly as traders looked ahead to Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department. The Dow Jones industrial average came within two points of 11,000 before turning lower for most of the day. According to preliminary calculations, the Dow fell 19, or 0.2 percent, to close at 10,949. The S&P 500 index fell 2, or 0.2 percent, to 1,158, while the Nasdaq rose 3, or 0.1 percent, to 2,384. Falling stocks narrowly outpaced rising ones on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 915 million shares. "
1,"A Mexican woman who says she endured beatings and rapes for decades at the hands of her common-law husband has won the right to stay in the United States. Experts say the case makes clear that domestic violence is valid grounds for asylum. The Department of Homeland Security found that the victim, known only by the initials L.R., had shown the Mexican government was not willing to protect her. An immigration judge found in her favor on Aug. 4, and the decision was announced by her attorneys this week. Asylum claims based on domestic violence are controversial. Asylum has traditionally been given to individuals being persecuted by a government. The woman's attorney says this is the second asylum case granted on allegations of domestic violence. "
1,"Sebastien Bourdais' stint with Toro Rosso is over, according to teammate Jaime Alguersuari. Bourdais' future with the team was under scrutiny at the German Grand Prix, where the Frenchman retired due to a car problem. 'He's a very good driver,' said Alguersuari, a 19-year-old Spanish reserve driver. 'But it looks like this year he hasn't given it his all like he's supposed to give. I sincerely believe that Red Bull's decision is just, but it's never good to see someone taken off the team halfway through the season.' Spanish media reported that Alguersuari, who was promoted to reserve driver in time for the German race, would replace Bourdais at the Hungarian GP on July 26. Toro Rosso would not comment on the decision. Bourdais said the team hadn't discussed the issue with him over the weekend. "
1,"A police officer and a soldier have been killed by gunmen in Russia's restive southern province of Dagestan, officials said Saturday. The police officer was attacked by gunmen late Friday in the town of Khasavyurt and died of wounds on the way to a hospital, said Vyacheslav Gasanov, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry's regional office. In a separate attack early Saturday a group of gunmen detonated an explosive device near a railway and ambushed a group of soldiers that responded to the incident, the ministry said. One soldier was wounded and later died in a hospital. Dagestan and other provinces in Russia's North Caucasus have seen near-daily attacks on police and other authorities by groups linked to an Islamic insurgency that has spread across the region after two separatist wars in Chechnya. Long-running tensions between different ethnic groups sometimes exploded into open conflicts in other areas of the south. Eight people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds and other injuries following a street clash late Friday in the town of Zelenokumsk of the Stavropol region. Local police said that the conflict erupted after a woman told a group of local men that several ethnic Chechens tried to abduct her. Dozens of local residents then clashed with a group of several Chechens before police interfered. Police later arrested four ethnic Chechens on charges of inflicting injuries to several people, said Alexander Noskov, a spokesman for the Stavropol region police. "
1,"KABUL , Afghanistan - The top NATO civilian in Afghanistan said Wednesday that coalition forces have 'regained the initiative' in the war, but he added that President Hamid Karzai's recent criticism of U.S. and NATO strategy is 'not helpful' in the lead-up to a key summit in Lisbon this weekend. Ambassador Mark Sedwill said that he and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in the country, plan to report at the Lisbon Conference that international forces have made significant progress against the Taliban since President Barack Obama ordered 30,000 additional U.S. troops to the region last summer. 'It's still clearly fragile, and there are significant risks and will be a long, hard campaign ahead, but we believe in 2010 we have achieved what we wished to - regaining the initiative after having lost it in the past few years,' Sedwill said, addressing reporters at a morning briefing in Kabul. 'We think we are in a different mode to where we were before, and the reason for that is simple: We've finally aligned our resources with the demands and objectives of the campaign. That's what the surge is all about.' But Sedwill added that Karzai's call for an end to Special Operations raids into Afghan homes to kill or capture Taliban commanders should not have been aired publicly at this critical juncture, even though Sedwill said he believes the president was heartfelt in the comments he made in an interview with The Washington Post on Saturday. 'It is not helpful to have a Washington Post headline suggesting a week before the summit that there is friction between the president of Afghanistan and the alliance, or with the ambassador or the general, over the conduct of the strategy,' Sedwill said. 'We have different perspectives, and it would be much better if we worked out those different perspectives in private.' Sedwill said he had a 'cordial but frank' conversation with Karzai after the interview was published. Afghan Education Minister Farooq Wardak, a Karzai confidant, said Wednesday that the president has been pushing for two years to have international troops concentrate on areas in Pakistan where terrorists take cover. 'The president of Afghanistan wants our international partners in the war on terror to focus more on the root causes of terrorism, the sanctuaries of terror where it was given birth and where it must get defeated,' Wardak said. 'This is not only the feeling of the president, but also the feeling of the entire nation that agrees with him.' Representatives of the Afghan government and the member countries that make up NATO'S International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan will attend the Lisbon Conference. Sedwill said much of the conference will be devoted to outlining plans for a handoff of primary security operations from NATO forces to Afghan troops by the end of 2014, which is emerging as the consensus time frame despite President Obama's goal of beginning an American drawdown next summer. Yet he conceded that even 2014 might not mark the end of foreign troops' control in some areas. 'There might still be one or two parts of the country where the transition process is ongoing, and that might last into 2015 or beyond,' Sedwill said. He added that 2014 is 'not an end of mission. It's not even a complete change of mission, but it is an inflection point where the balance of the mission would have shifted.' International troops will begin to hand over more duties to Afghan soldiers and police beginning in the first half of 2011, Sedwill said, but he declined to say in which provinces the effort will begin. 'My strong view is that we shouldn't be announcing districts or towns where transition is happening immediately, because that will paint a bull's-eye on it and invite the Taliban to come in and try to assassinate key Afghan officials involved and knock it backward,' Sedwill said. 'It's critical this process feels like a one-way process, sustainable and irreversible.' He said transition efforts could take as long as two years in a given province before the Afghans take full control, and he predicted that violence caused by criminals and ethnic rivalries will still be a problem in 2014. Asked how confident he is of the timeline for transition, Sedwill said: 'The phrase we used in the [Lisbon] campaign report is that it's a realistic goal but not guaranteed.' "
1,"World stock markets dropped along with the euro Thursday amid growing concerns about Greece's ability to bring its debt crisis under control. Major markets in Asia were down around 1 percent or less and European shares opened lower. The euro fell to near its lowest point against the dollar in about nine months before recouping some losses. Oil prices slipped below $80 a barrel. Despite solid overnight gains in the U.S. and Europe, Asian stocks were unable to hold their early advance as Greece's crisis and the prospect of spillover effects led investors to cut back their bullish bets. Standard & Poor's, one of the three leading credit ratings agencies, warned Wednesday it could cut its rating on the country within a month. Meanwhile, Greece convulsed with labor protests over austerity measures demanded by the European Union to ease the crisis. 'The market is questioning whether Greece will have the willpower to implement the cuts,' said Khiem Do, a Hong Kong-based fund manager who helps oversee more than $10 billion in Asian equities at Baring Asset Management. 'They don't trust that Greece will drink the bitter medicine it needs.' Worries about Greece outweighed more assurances from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke borrowing costs will stay at rock-bottom lows. Speaking to lawmakers, Bernanke said low rates were needed 'for an extended period' to help keep the economic recovery on track and Americans hard-hit by high unemployment and falling housing prices. As trading opened in Europe, markets in Britain and Germany shed 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.3 percent. Wall Street was set to open down after U.S. futures fell. Earlier in Asia, the Nikkei 225 stock average fell 96.87 points, or 1 percent, to 10,101.96. Shares of Toyota Motor Corp. edged down 0.2 percent after president Akio Toyoda, appearing before U.S. lawmakers, apologized for safety lapses that have led to deaths and widespread recalls. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.6 percent to 1,587.51 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.3 percent to 20,399.57. Elsewhere, Australia's market dropped 1.2 percent while India's market gained 0.1 percent. Shanghai's benchmark defied the downward swing, rising 1.3 percent. The euro fell to $1.3484 from $1.3534, hitting a low of $1.3452 during the session. The dollar slid to 89.40 yen from 90.10 yen. In oil, benchmark crude of April delivery was changing hands at $79.59 a barrel, down 41 cents from the previous session. The contract gained $1.14 overnight. Wednesday on Wall Street, the Dow rose 91.75, or 0.9 percent, to 10,374.16. The advance pared the Dow's loss for the week to 28 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.64, or 1 percent, to 1,105.24, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.46, or 1 percent, to 2,235.90. "
1,"Oil prices hovered below $84 a barrel Friday in Asia as traders mulled how much economic growth in China may slow next year and drag down demand for crude. Benchmark oil for January delivery was up 5 cents to $83.91 a barrel at midday Singapore time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract last settled at $83.86 on Wednesday after gaining $2.61. Markets in the U.S. were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Markets reopen Friday, but trading volume is often light because many traders take the day off. China's energy consumption has led growth in global oil demand this year, but investors are worried that recent measures aimed at containing inflation will undermine its economic expansion. China's gross domestic product growth, which has averaged about 10 percent a year for the last five years, will likely slow next year to between 8 percent and 9 percent, Capital Economics said in a report. 'Even though we are not as pessimistic as some on the prospects for China, we still expect commodity prices to drop back further next year,' Capital Economics said. 'If inflation rises much further and remains high, a period of sub-8 percent GDP growth will become increasingly likely.' In other Nymex trading in December contracts, heating oil fell 0.7 cent to $2.32 a gallon and gasoline was steady at $2.21 a gallon. Natural gas rose 0.4 cent to $4.39 per 1,000 cubic feet. In London, Brent crude dropped 35 cents to $85.75 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. "
1,"Baby boomers in the U.S. are the unhappiest age group when it comes to their sex life. Yet, a majority of boomers think they have learned just about all there is to know on the subject -- and more women than men are confident of their knowledge -- according to a new Associated Press-LifeGoesStrong.com poll. Among people aged 45 to 65, 59 percent of women think they know all about sex, while just 48 percent of men share that confidence level. 'I don't think a single person in the whole world knows all there is about sex,' commented Debby Herbenick of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University. 'Women historically have more resources,' to learn about sex, noted Jennifer Bass, director of communications at the Kinsey Institute for Sex, Gender and Reproduction. Among age groups, baby boomers are the unhappiest with their sex lives. Some 24 percent say they are dissatisfied, compared with 12 percent of 18-29 year olds, 20 percent of 30-44 year olds and 17 percent of those over 65. A majority of female boomers -- 56 percent -- say their sex drive has decreased as they have gotten older, compared with 46 percent of men. Seventy-two percent of men aged 45-65 have fantasized about having sex with someone other than their sexual partner at the time, compared with 48 percent of women. The new poll also found that among those aged 45 to 55, nearly half the men -- 48 percent -- complained that their partners do not want to have sex as often as they do, while just 13 percent of women in that age group say the same. 'Men certainly do tend to have higher sex drives, as a whole,' Herbenick said, though she noted that some women also have quite high sex drives.' At that age, she pointed out, women tend to be going into menopause, which can have marked impacts on their sex lives, having hot flashes and feeling tired. There is less disagreement between the sexes between 55 and 65, with majorities of both men and women saying couples can have a strong relationship without sexual activity. Some 59 percent of men at that age, and 69 percent of women, agreed with that. The AP-LifeGoesStrong poll also found that overall, 28 percent of men and 21 percent of women in the baby boom generation are dissatisfied with their sex lives. That is similar to the findings of other surveys, Herbenick said. The AP-LifeGoesStrong.com Poll of the boomer generation about sex and relationships was conducted Oct. 1-10, by Knowledge Networks. It involved online interviews with 945 adults between the ages of 45 and 65, as well as companion interviews with an additional 587 adults of other age groups, ages 18-44 and over 65 years of age. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all adults, 3.9 percentage points for adults ages 45-65. The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, which uses a probability-based design. Respondents to the survey were first selected randomly for KnowledgePanel using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed for this survey online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who did not otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them. ------ Online: "
1,"A black player was racially taunted by spectators at the second-division game between second-place Real Betis and leader Cartagena, according to the referee. Alfonso Pino Zamorano said in his post-match report that Cartagena's Panamanian substitute, Alberto Quintero Medina, was subjected to monkey taunts from the crowd during Sunday's goalless draw at Betis' Manuel Ruiz de Lopera Stadium. Pino Zamorano briefly halted the match in the 78th minute and a loudspeaker announcement was made requesting the taunting to stop. This latest episode of racist behavior by spectators at a Spanish sporting event came five days before Madrid learns whether it will host 2016 Olympic Games. Spanish authorities have recently tried to improve the country's image by dealing with such incidents with greater severity. "
1,"(c) 2010, The Washington Post= WASHINGTON _ Opening your political Washington movie in front of a media- political Washington audience? Pretty much the definition of 'tough crowd.' That was the room that 'Casino Jack' faced Wednesday at an E Street Cinema screening of the Kevin Spacey-as-Jack Abramoff flick, sponsored by the Creative Coalition, with faces like Andrea Mitchell, Jane Harman and Ben Bradlee in the crowd. You didn't have to be a Pulitzer-winning expert on the Byzantine schemes of the disgraced former superlobbyist to wince at the Hollywood embroidery and hyperbole. Rep. Bob Ney getting handcuffed in the halls of Congress? Doesn't work that way. Abramoff's now-defunct Signatures declared 'the best restaurant in town'? Don't recall that. They even botched the cliched insult: It's not 'Washington is Hollywood with ugly faces,' it's 'Washington is Hollywood for ugly people'! Possibly the room's favorite groaner: The rooftop happy hour where a journalist taunts Abramoff for his links to Mariana Islands sweatshops and gets slugged in the face by another lobbyist. Next line: 'You just hit a hemophiliac reporter for The Washington Post!' (We've asked around. Didn't happen. Sorry.) There was just too much, really, and moderator Chris Matthews seemed too weary to take it all on in the post-screening Q&A, so he let Spacey off the hook with mild hazing. 'How'd ya get permission to shoot on the Capitol lawn?' the MSNBC anchor asked. 'That's not allowed. HAH!' 'I think we call it CGI,' the star responded dryly. 'We shot it all in Toronto.' The movie was meant to 'shed a light on a process that is a culture,' said Spacey. 'When we look at the kind of money that needs to be raised for campaigns ... maybe we can make some points about the hypocrisy' and inspire some change. Well, what kind? Spacey suggested that campaign reform could begin by cutting back on costly ads. The networks, he said, could 'decide they could serve the public' by vetting all campaign ads for accuracy, and then 'run them for free.' Huh. 'You've gotten beyond me,' growled Matthews. 'I don't know how to do that. Because of the First Amendment.' The mood was a little flat, as it's reportedly been at many recent 'Casino Jack' unveilings: The director, George Hickenlooper, died suddenly two weeks ago in Denver at age 47. Spacey said he most regretted that Hickenlooper missed screening the movie for a D.C. audience. 'He was finally being recognized as a great filmmaker.' A man in the audience who said he was a friend of Abramoff's applauded Spacey's nuanced portrayal. Abramoff wasn't just a heavy, 'he was dorky,' the friend said. 'He was a dorky guy. I thought you did a fantastic job.' "
1,"At the Barnes & Noble in Virginia's Tysons Corner Center, one aisle has a peculiar new configuration. On one side, new current events books about America and its troubles and promise. On the other side, toys: Cook and Play Potsy, My Pal Scout, Ernie Fire Engine. 'I had no idea this was here,' said Charles Davis, an Alexandria resident shopping with his companion, Sabina Sauer. They had stumbled upon the intriguing new world of toy retailing, in which Barnes & Noble, Borders and retailers even less associated with products for little kids - Whole Foods Market, The Vitamin Shoppe - are angling for parental wallets with high-end, mostly educational toys, often with a green component. The new toy hawkers know that children's wares have been an easy path to parents' wallets for eons, particularly during recessions. Older shoppers may recall that the original department stores placed children's items in the very back, so moms had to traverse the entire store, much as many supermarkets stock milk in the rear corner of the store. But in many ways, the latest shift in the $21 billion toy industry represents yet another reordering of the brick-and-mortar world brought on by the digital revolution. The trend toward adding unrelated product lines may seem to fly in the face of the niche marketing that has flourished in the Internet era, but retailers say going broader may be an answer to their woes. The specialty toy industry has contracted significantly in the past decade as big toy chains swallowed smaller independents in a bid to stave off threats from Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Popular chains such as Zany Brainy and Imaginarium are history. The only stand-alone toy store at Tysons Corner Center is Lego. Toy industry executives say that contraction, along with the heavy influence of Amazon.com - which has shown that a business can establish itself by selling one thing (books) and then add many other products - has given nontraditional toy sellers confidence that putting puzzles, games and other delights on their shelves will not turn off consumers. In fact, the surprise of finding an unexpected toy might be pleasant. About 40 percent of toy purchases aren't planned, according to the NPD Group. That's helped Green Toys Inc. sell lots of tugboats made from recycled plastic at Whole Foods. The company's jump-ropes and tool sets are also sold through EcoShoppe, a green-oriented line of stores operated by The Vitamin Shoppe. 'This is really an extension of what Amazon brought the world,' said Robert von Goeben, who started Green Toys, based in San Francisco, in 2008. 'They moved laterally, and they were very successful at that. Their shoppers got used to finding other items. We now know the Internet is one large buy-everything place, and the bricks and mortars now realize that there are successful lateral moves they can make.' Whole Foods sells puzzles and games by several speciality toymakers in the middle of its supermarkets, in the vitamins and healthy-body section. The toys are eco-friendly and mainly educational, and executives say they are thrilled by the response. 'We gain a lot of customers during big life changes, like pregnancy and childbirth, when people start beginning to be more conscious about what they eat and then moving to organic products,' said Jeremiah McElwee, senior whole body coordinator for Whole Foods. 'We have a very high percentage of mothers and children shopping together in our stores, and we want to be a destination for them. People want to find more variety in that one stop they make.' Booksellers are turning to toys in part because they are finding themselves with extra floor space as their music and movie departments shrink or close entirely, having been significantly disrupted by iTunes and Netflix. Booksellers are also fighting against Kindles and iPads to hold on to book sales. So in the new floor space, booksellers are adding aisles of toys, marketing the new items as related to books because they are educational. Barnes & Noble executives also concede that profits on toys are often better than in other categories. 'The margin for us is not necessarily the motivation, but it has been a benefit of the mix,' said Kathleen Campisano, vice president of toys and games for Barnes & Noble. The chain is now testing going beyond a few aisles, in some stores devoting as much space to toys as to the entire fiction selection. 'How high can we go with this business?' she said. 'How broad can it be? That's what we're trying to figure out.' 'The question really is: What are they going to do when they can't sell books anymore?' said Steven Aarons, president of Barstons Child's Play, a Washington- area chain of five toy stores. 'Are they just going to be a department store?' "
1,"The U.S. government is seeing 'hints' that adversaries are targeting military networks for 'remote' sabotage, the head of the Pentagon's recently launched Cyber Command said in his first public remarks since being confirmed last month. 'The potential for sabotage and destruction is now possible and something we must treat seriously,' said Gen. Keith Alexander, who also heads the National Security Agency, the nation's largest intelligence agency. 'Our Department of Defense must be able to operate freely and defend its resources in cyberspace.' Alexander spoke Thursday before more than 300 people at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. In remarks afterward, Alexander said he is concerned about the safety of computer systems used in war zones. 'The concern I have is when you look at what could happen to a computer, clearly sabotage and destruction are things that are yet to come,' he said. 'If we don't defend our systems, people will be able to break them.' James Lewis, director of CSIS's Technology and Public Policy Program, said advanced militaries are capable of destroying U.S. computer systems. 'That wasn't true four years ago, but it's true now and Cyber Command will have to deal with it,' he said. The Cyber Command, launched last month at Fort Meade, Md., was created by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to streamline the military's capabilities to attack and defend in cyberspace, supported by NSA's intelligence capabilities. Alexander stressed that the Command will focus on protecting the U.S. military's 15,000 computer networks under oversight of the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Congress and the administration. His remarks were aimed at assuaging concerns over the NSA's role in helping to protect civilian and private-sector networks, as well as fears of a 'militarization' of cyberspace. 'We spend a lot of time with the court, with Congress, the administration, the oversight committees to ensure they know what we're doing and why we're doing it,' Alexander said. This is done in classified settings, he said, including before the surveillance court, set up as part of the effort to protect Americans from unwarranted government surveillance. 'The hard part is, we can't go out and tell everybody exactly what we did or we give up capability that may be extremely useful in protecting our country and our allies,' he said. Alexander's confirmation was delayed for months by congressional concerns over the command's role and scope of action, how its operations would affect Americans' privacy, and a lack of clarity over rules of the road in cyber warfare. The rules are still being debated and formulated, he said. So are the rules of engagement for working with the Department of Homeland Security and private industry in protecting the private sector's systems, which is perhaps the most difficult challenge. But Alexander has his hands full just hardening the military's systems. DOD systems are probed by unauthorized users more than 6 million times a day. 'While our front-line defenses are up to this challenge, we still have to devote too much of our time and resources to dealing with relatively mundane problems,' such as poorly engineered software and missing patches, he said. "
1,"Pakistan said Wednesday that it was satisfied with U.S. pledges, made during a day-long strategic conference here, to increase and streamline the delivery of military and economic aid and to 'move from a relationship to a partnership.' 'Today, I am a happy man and a satisfied man,' Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said at a news conference with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 'I'm satisfied because you finally agreed to many of the things that we've been sharing in our discussions over the last, you know, two years.' The Obama administration's primary goals for the gathering were to create a new level of bonding between the two countries and to win increased Pakistani cooperation in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida. U.S. officials, aware of Pakistan's often-prickly response to perceived slights, were deferential to the Pakistanis and offered fulsome praise. 'We have listened, and we will continue to listen,' Clinton said. 'And we want to demonstrate by both word and deed our respect for Pakistan's concerns and ideas and share our own.' 'It really has been extraordinary, in my view, seeing what Pakistan has done over the last, really, more than a year,' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said of Pakistan's counterinsurgency efforts targeting Taliban havens in the mountainous region along the Afghanistan border. Gates spoke Wednesday at a separate congressional budget hearing, along with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both men later attended the conference hosted by Clinton at the State Department. U.S. officials had hoped that the presence of Gates and Mullen would demonstrate by example the preeminence of civilian power over military power in the U.S. system, something the administration would like to see evolve in Pakistan's fragile democracy. Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani, the powerful army chief of staff, was clearly the star of Pakistan's delegation, if not its official leader. At a Tuesday evening reception at the Pakistani Embassy, Kiyani's entry brought a hush to the crowd and the appearance of dozens of cellphone cameras, wielded by Pakistanis and Americans alike. Although senior U.S. defense officials have privately hosted Kiyani numerous times over the past several days, in public, at least, he has taken a back seat to the civilians, Qureshi and Pakistan's little-known defense minister, Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar. Most of the agreements announced after the one-day meeting had been decided earlier, including disbursement of a new $7.5-billion, five-year U.S. aid package for Pakistan's energy, water, agricultural and education sectors. Long- standing Pakistani complaints about nearly $1 billion in promised but unpaid U.S. reimbursements for Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations had been largely resolved, with the remaining money to be paid by the end of June. The administration said that it would improve on what Pakistan has described as slow delivery of military hardware and that it would keep trying to facilitate better Pakistani access to U.S. markets and a transit trade arrangement with Afghanistan. Pakistan arrived at the meeting with a 56-page list of 'priorities,' some of which, such as a civilian nuclear agreement similar to the one the United States has with India, were far beyond the scope of what the administration was prepared to give. Clinton merely said that she was happy to 'listen and engage with our Pakistani partners on whatever issues the delegation raises.' 'I'm particularly pleased that we are moving forward with $125 million to Pakistan for energy-sector projects,' she added. Another U.S. goal, Clinton said, was a 'multi-year security assistance package,' similar to the five-year economic funding plan. Clinton and Qureshi also deflected questions about the equally sensitive issue of Pakistan's ties with the Taliban and Islamabad's desire to play a prominent role in reconciliation talks with insurgents proposed by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. 'It's their choice,' Qureshi said of the Afghans. 'If they feel we can contribute, if we can help, we'll be more than willing.' He said he had invited Afghanistan's foreign minister to Pakistan 'for a detailed discussion on the reintegration/reconciliation process.' Clinton demurred, saying, 'I agree with what the foreign minister said.' "
1,"The Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to impose halts on some stocks that swing more than 10 percent starting Friday may be followed by more measures to slow down trading. The circuit-breaker test, a response to the May 6 plunge that wiped out $862 million of share value in 20 minutes, will begin as a pilot covering five stocks before expanding next week. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said this week the agency is considering regulating the speed of stock orders as part of a broader effort to rein in electronic markets. Regulators are under pressure from investors and lawmakers to show they have a grip on markets increasingly dominated by computers trading thousands of shares in less than a second. Different rules on as many as 50 American equities venues helped exacerbate the May 6 selloff as some platforms were overwhelmed with electronic instructions to sell shares. The SEC needs 'to explore whether bids and orders should be regulated on speed so there is less incentive to engage in this microsecond arms race that might undermine long-term investors and the market's capital-formation function,' Schapiro said at a conference in Montreal. 'The markets have to serve that function for companies to raise money, create jobs and allow the economy to grow.' The circuit-breaker test, scheduled to last through Dec. 10, will pause trading for five minutes when a company rises or falls 10 percent in five minutes or less. The curbs apply only between 9:45 a.m. and 3:45 p.m. New York time. The New York Stock Exchange said it will begin implementing them Friday after delaying the program last week. NYSE Euronext said five stocks -- EOG Resources Inc., Genuine Parts Co., Harley- Davidson Inc., Ryder System Inc. and Zimmer Holdings Inc. -- will be covered by the halts Friday, according to a statement on its website. The remaining 399 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies that NYSE lists will be subject to the rules by June 16 -- with 39 on June 14, 179 more on June 15 and the final 181 the final day, the exchange said. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. will activate the program with all of its S&P 500 stocks on June 14, spokesman Robert Madden said in an e-mailed statement this week. Schapiro, speaking at an International Organization of Securities Commissions event this week, said the SEC is examining whether electronic venues known as dark pools, which don't display public quotes, are preventing stocks from trading at their appropriate prices. 'We are also looking at whether and to what extent pre-trade price discovery is impaired by the diversion of desirable, marketable order flow from public markets to dark pools,' she said. The SEC proposed rules in October that would limit the ability of dark pools to seek new orders to match existing ones without displaying prices. The agency is also considering eliminating flash orders, or pricing data shown a split-second early to a segment of market participants. Rules for stocks can't be applied in isolation, Gary Cohn, president of New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said at the conference. Since many stocks are constituents of indexes or included in exchange-traded funds, pricing won't cease entirely when trading in particular shares is halted. 'It's virtually impossible not to create price discovery by stopping just one stock,' he said. 'You have to stop all the associated vehicles.' BlackRock Inc. in New York and Vanguard Group Inc. said ETFs, which made up 70 percent of securities with trades on May 6 that were later canceled because of excessive declines, shouldn't be omitted from the circuit-breaker pilot. Vanguard's mutual funds had $1.42 trillion in assets as of March 31, while BlackRock's had $3.36 trillion, making it the world's biggest money manager. Schapiro has pledged to increase the scope of the pilot to 'thousands' of additional public companies. 'BlackRock has been informed by a number of large liquidity providers that when the steep decrease in U.S. equity values neared 10 percent -- a level specified as a `reference' in exchange erroneous trade rules -- the liquidity providers steeply discounted or ceased their bids for ETFs,' the firm said in a June 2 letter to the SEC. Companies 'pulled back from bidding for shares of ETFs that owned high percentages of stocks perceived as vulnerable to cancellations,' BlackRock said. The SEC said in a joint report with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on May 18 that ETFs were the securities most affected by the May 6 plunge. ETFs, whose price is based on the value of the shares they include, declined because the price of underlying stocks decreased. The inability of market makers to hedge their trades on May 6 by buying and selling the constituent stocks may also have 'contributed to a lack of liquidity in ETF shares,' regulators found. 'If a stock within an ETF halts and the ETF continues to trade, market makers will back away from the ETF and stop making markets,' Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard, said in an interview. This applies to firms with specific trading obligations called designated market makers on NYSE and 'unofficial people making makers' on other venues, he said. Nina Mehta reported from New York. Whitney Kisling contributed from New York. "
1,"The top military and civilian officials in Baghdad are both reported to be leaving this summer. Ambassador Christopher Hill, a career Foreign Service officer, is to be replaced by the current ambassador to Turkey, Jim Jeffrey, according to a report by Politico's Laura Rozen. Jeffrey, also a veteran diplomat well versed in the region, was a top National Security Council aide during Bush II and had been principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs. No word on where Hill is headed. Also playing musical chairs are Stu Jones, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe working the Balkans portfolio, and Cameron Munter, a counselor in Baghdad. Jones would go to Baghdad as No. 2 to Jeffrey, and Munter would replace Jones. Luis Moreno, deputy chief of mission in Tel Aviv, would replace Munter in Baghdad. The Jeffrey-to-Baghdad news comes after a Fox News report last month that Gen. Ray Odierno, the commanding officer in Iraq, is rotating out in September after the drawdown of combat troops there. Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin, now working at the Joint Chiefs of Staff and formerly in Iraq serving under Odierno, was said to be the front-runner to replace Odierno. So a whole new dynamic duo coming soon to Iraq. "
1,"Found at World Trade Center ST. LEONARD, Md. _ Once, this was a stout ship, with oak futtocks and floor timbers, fastened with iron nails, built with saw and adz and the calloused hands of shipwrights now long dead. Two centuries ago, it was a simple coaster, hauling goods around the Eastern capes, armed against pirates, and ending its days at a wharf in New York City. As the years went by, it sank into the harbor mud, entombed beneath what would one day become the World Trade Center site. Shortly after noon Monday, two trucks bearing the ship's unearthed skeleton pulled into a Maryland science complex on the shore of the Patuxent River in St. Leonard, where scores of eager archaeologists and curators waited as if for the bones of a dinosaur. There, over the next few hours, workers in lab coats and T-shirts unloaded the pieces one at a time, arrayed most of them on tarps and with hose and sponge, toothbrush and bare hands scrubbed away the muck of 200 years. And there, over the next few weeks, scientists hope to discover when the ship was built, where it traveled, exactly how big it was and more about the bygone world in which it sailed. The ship was discovered in New York on July 12 when its ribs were spotted poking out of the muck as workers were excavating the World Trade Center site. Last week, the pieces were catalogued and removed by a team that included staff from Maryland's state archaeological conservation laboratory, which specializes in such work. It's not clear how the ship got buried beneath the twin towers, which were destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It could have been used as fill when the Manhattan shoreline was expanded into the Hudson River about 1800, curators say. Sections of San Francisco are built on fill partly made of old ships, said Betty Seifert, a curator at the laboratory. Or the vessel might have sunk at its wharf and been forgotten. Ships 'get old, they get tired, they get tied in and left and abandoned,' Seifert said. And it's not clear what kind of ship it is. 'Never seen anything exactly like this,' said Warren Riess, professor of maritime history and archaeology at the University of Maine and lead investigator on the discovery. 'I'm thinking still that it's about the right size and construction to be what would have been called a coaster,' he said this week as he watched the timbers being unloaded. 'A ship that went down the coast from New York to maybe Maryland, Virginia, Barbados, Boston ... carrying everyday cargo.' The vessel was probably about 6o or 70 feet long and about 18 feet wide, he said. It probably had one or two masts, was a sloop or a brig, and sailed in the late 1700s and early 1800s, he said. The square iron nails in the wood, rather than wooden pegs or 'trunnels,' indicate a later vintage, Riess said. 'Almost the whole thing is tied together with big iron nails.' He said it's not known where the ship was built, although tree scientists are being called in to see whether they can figure out where its wood came from and how old it is. Other scientists might be able to trace where the vessel had been by studying the tiny shells left behind by geographically specific ship worms that ate into the wood, he said. 'It's a mystery,' Riess said. 'It's like a detective story.' (Optional add end) He said that in the bowels of the vessel, workers found, among other things, a well-used bowl of a clay smoking pipe that was probably lost by one of the ship builders. Also found was some buckshot, musket balls and a small cannonball, perhaps from a swivel gun, indicating that the ship was most likely armed against pirates, some of whom lurked in the New Jersey marshlands, he said. Many of the surviving pieces of the ship were 'futtocks' _ curved parts of the frame that were cut from specially selected curved tree limbs, Riess said. Almost all the wood was oak. Also recovered was inner and outer planking, part of the keel and a single, 530-pound piece that was part of either the ship's bow or stern. That had to be lifted from a truck bed with a power hoist. 'Good, solid wood,' Riess said. 'Remember, these ships (had) no radio, they can't call for help, they don't know where they are,' he said. 'If they see a storm coming, they can't run from it. Even a hurricane. ... They've got to make it through on their own ... lives (of the crew) really depended on the ships.' "
1,"Chilean miner Edison Pena has arrived in the United States to try to run the New York City Marathon, greeted at the airport by world-record holder Haile Gebrselassie. New York Road Runners President Mary Wittenberg said after meeting Pena at the airport that he was cheered when he got off the plane by many other Chileans who were running Sunday's marathon and happened to also fly in Thursday. Wittenberg says Pena immediately recognized Gebrselassie and was thrilled to meet him. Pena was scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday afternoon. Marathon officials invited Pena to attend after hearing about how he jogged in the mines while trapped underground. They were surprised to learn Monday that the triathlete wanted to run the race. "
1,"Burma's military regime has forced our party, the National League for Democracy, to make a tough decision on whether we will continue to operate legally. The ruling generals, known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), issued a set of unjust electoral laws this month that threatened to abolish our party if we did not re-register at the election commission within 60 days. We know the cruel nature of the regime. We did not expect the electoral laws it established would offer a semblance of fairness. But we also did not expect that the regime would use its laws to remove our leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and all political prisoners from the political process. Once again the regime has defied the will of the people of Burma and the international community by disregarding their call for transparent, free and fair elections that include all parties. The Political Party Registration Law bans all political prisoners from participating in elections by voting and contesting, forming a political party, or joining a party. Parties must make sure that political prisoners are not included in their membership and must pledge in writing that they will obey and protect the country's constitution and abide by its election laws. They are also required to participate in the election. Failure to comply with these restrictions will lead to abolishment of the party. For me, the decision was simple: No. We cannot expel Aung San Suu Kyi and others who are or have been imprisoned under this corrupt and unfair legal system. Without them, our party would be nothing. They are in prison because of their belief in democracy and the rule of law. Their immediate release and participation in Burma's political process are necessary for a credible democratic process. We do not accept the regime's unilaterally drafted constitution, designed to legalize permanent military dictatorship. The referendum to ratify this constitution was conducted on the heels of Cyclone Nargis in 2008; it was 'approved' by force and fraud. Our objective is to reject this sham constitution and create one that will guarantee democracy, human rights, justice, the rule of law and equality among all ethnic nationalities through an all-inclusive, genuine political dialogue. We cannot pledge to obey the sham constitution. True democracy will not come from this process. It is not easy to make such a decision for an organization. Aung San Suu Kyi said she would 'not even think' of registering her party for the polls. Yet as a leader who believes in democracy, she stressed that she would let the party decide for itself. On Monday, all of my colleagues agreed to confront these injustices together. Some believe that the continued legal status of our party is more important. If our party is not legal, the thinking goes, how can we work for the people of Burma? The United Nations and some countries have asked the regime to change these unfair laws and to allow Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners to participate in the election. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon held a meeting of his 'Group of Friends on Myanmar' to discuss the situation in Burma. We have also heard that the U.S. government is 'closely considering' the recent report and recommendations made by U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom s Ojea Quintana, including his suggestion that the United Nations establish a 'commission of inquiry' to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in our country. This latent support from international voices may not be enough. My colleagues may have justifiable concerns that international voices and statements are not complemented by effective measures to change Burma's political crisis. Our party was born out of the 1988 popular democracy uprising with the noble intention to carry out the unfinished work of those who sacrificed their lives for freedom, justice and democracy. We won a landslide victory in the 1990 election and have been the leader of Burma's democracy movement for more than two decades. But because we refuse to bow to these unjust election 'laws,' our party will be abolished by the regime soon. Still, the NLD will not disappear. We will be among the people, with the people. We will continue to fight for democracy, human rights and equality among all ethnic nationalities, by peaceful means. I hope the international community will stand with us. The governments of the world should declare that they reject the regime's election and prearranged outcome, and pressure the regime to make substantive and positive change for Burma, beginning with the immediate release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the cessation of the regime's military campaign against ethnic minorities. The regime should negotiate with Burma's democracy forces, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, and ethnic representatives for a peaceful solution toward national reconciliation and true democracy. U Win Tin is a member of the Central Executive Committee and a founder of Burma's National League for Democracy party. He was a political prisoner from 1989 to 2008. "
1,"The U.S. Embassy in Moldova expressed concern on Thursday about the arrest a Moldovan journalist in a separatist province on spying charges, and said his legal and human rights must be respected. Ernest Vardanean was arrested on suspicion of 'spying and high treason' on April 7 and ordered held in custody for two months in Trans-Dniester -- a tiny, poor and obscure area of Moldova that's a Russian-speaking Soviet-era relic. Word of his arrest came a week later. It was not clear what the charges centered on, although Vardanean has been critical of separatist authorities in his reports for the Russian news agency Novyi Region. If convicted as charged, Vardanean could be jailed for 20 years. U.S. Ambassador to Moldova Asif J. Chaudhry discussed the arrest with longtime separatist leader Igor Smirnov on April 14 in Tiraspol, the separatist region's capital. Smirnov told him the case was secret, the official Trans-Dniester Olvia-Pres news agency reported. 'The United States Embassy remains deeply concerned by the arrest ... and the procedures under which he is being held by the Trans-Dnistrian authorities. We strongly urge that international standards of fundamental human and legal rights be strictly observed in this case,' said a statement Thursday. It said the embassy was 'disturbed' by reports that neither Vardanean or his lawyer had been able to attend the pretrial detention hearing. Trans-Dniester broke away from Moldova in 1990, fearing it wanted to reunite with neighboring Romania. A war between Moldovan forces and separatists in 1992 killed 1,500 people. The region is not internationally recognized but is supported by Russia, which has around 500 troops stationed there to guard weapons storage facilities left by the Soviet military. Separatist authorities are scheduled to hold elections later this year. "
1,"The White House has said the decision to challenge Arizona's immigration law was out of its hands, left completely up to Attorney General Eric Holder and the lawyers at the Justice Department. But the implications of the suit filed Tuesday are potentially huge for President Obama and the Democratic Party as the election season begins in earnest later this summer. The federal lawsuit all but ensures a politically charged immigration debate will be in the spotlight in many crucial House and Senate contests. Obama will be called upon frequently in the next several months to make the government's case that the Arizona measure unlawfully preempts federal law. As he campaigns for Democrats at town hall meetings around the country, it will be Obama _ not Holder _ who will be at the center of the intense discussion. A senior Democratic strategist said Obama will probably seek to avoid directly defending the government's suit, or attacking the Arizona law, which remains popular in most polls. Americans largely see the law as an effort to do something about illegal immigration in the wake of federal inaction. Instead, Obama will try to argue broadly about the need for comprehensive immigration reform and will say that the Arizona law does not represent the kind of action that he thinks is needed. 'There is probably some short term pain politically given how popular the law is,' said the Democratic strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the government lawsuit had not been filed at the time. 'But considering the demographic changes the country is undergoing, long term, there is a lot of upside in advocating for Latinos and comprehensive immigration reform.' The immigration issue is complex and regional, playing out differently in different parts of the country. In border states, anti-immigrant sentiment can run high, but it also often countered by the feelings of large numbers of Hispanic voters. It's an issue that can create political wildfires that are not easily controlled. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., found that out the hard way as he started his campaign for president in 2007 by making much the same argument on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform that Obama now advocates. At one town hall meeting after another, anti-immigration activists bombarded McCain with angry comments, even in places _ such as Iowa and New Hampshire _ where his handlers had not expected huge concern about the issue. McCain abandoned his support of an immigration overhaul in the face of the red- hot anger within his party. Since then, the anger has spread more broadly, helping to spark the tea party movement and push immigration to the forefront in several state election races. Now facing a tough primary challenge in his reelection bid, McCain has endorsed his state's law and wants to send thousands of National Guard soldiers to the border. Obama and the White House have sought to position the president as an advocate for greater border security by announcing an increase in the number of national guard troop a at the border. At the same time, Obama is increasingly calling on Republicans to rejoin the fight for an immigration overhaul that McCain and former president George W. Bush once called a top priority. As he did last week, Obama intends to repeatedly remind voters that Republicans such as McCain, who changed their minds, are standing in the way of a comprehensive overhaul of federal immigration policy. The president 'has made clear that his administration will not just kick the can down the road,' White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said. 'Immigration reform is no exception. The president believes that the system is broken and that reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling.' For some nervous Democratic lawmakers, the focus on immigration could present difficulties getting reelected this November. But party leaders are hoping that the president's rhetoric _ and the decision to challenge the Arizona law _ will help to highlight a serious political challenge for Republicans over the long term. The growth of the Hispanic population, and its support of Democrats in 2008, suggests that Republicans could find themselves in a difficult position if that community concludes that the GOP is not friendly to its interests. "
1,"Bordeaux vigneron Michel Rolland, consultant for more than 100 wineries in a dozen countries, is blamed by some for fostering the fashion for high-alcohol cult wines like those from California's Harlan Estate and Staglin Family. Yet a recent tasting of Rolland's seventh vintage of the Argentinean wine Clos de los Siete shows he is able to make a 21st century-style red at the top of its class. And with the 2008 vintage, he does it for only $19 a bottle. Clos de los Siete is a blend of 56 percent malbec, 21 percent merlot, 11 percent syrah, 10 percent cabernet sauvignon and 2 percent petit verdot. It's made in the Uco Valley south of Mendoza, Argentina's top wine region, where malbec is the principal fine-wine grape. Plenty of sun, high humidity and low rainfall coupled with sandy soil and clay provide ideal conditions for such varietals, and they come together in Clos de los Siete's soft and velvety texture of the merlot, intense fruit of the syrah, mild tannins from the cabernet, and ballast and spice of the late-ripening petit verdot. The blend may change in any vintage and the wines are neither fined nor filtered _ processes used to remove solid residues. At 14.5 percent alcohol, Clos de los Siete might bolster the characterization of Rolland as an advocate of reds whose deliberately overripe fruit, high alcohol, and long aging in oak produce 'fruit bombs' that win medals in competition. Many critics, myself included, decry such wines as often being out of balance, headache-inducing and closer to Port than red wine. A New York Times article on Rolland was entitled 'Satan or Savior: Setting the Grape Standard.' In the 2004 documentary film 'Mondovino,' Rolland is shown advising clients to use a technique called micro-oxygenation that can help tame tannins and soften wines. 'That movie is all crap!' Rolland bellowed in a phone interview. 'In some European wineries micro-oxygenation is helpful, but you don't need it in New World wines because there is so much sun to build up the sugars.' Rolland has six formidable partners in Argentina, including Rhone Valley vigneron Catherine Pere-Vigne and Benjamin de Rothschild, owner and chief executive officer of LCF Rothschild Group. With such resources he was able to switch traditional Argentinean 'parral' trellising and pruning methods to traditional systems used in Bordeaux. Drip irrigation keeps the vines 'stressed,' to allow the bare minimum of water. Grapes are all handpicked, and the wines aged for 11 months, 70 percent in new French oak, the rest in vat. Of the property's 2,100 hectares, 1,062 are currently planted. This year the output is a hefty 50,000 cases exported to 57 countries, with 30,000 going to the U.S. Rolland thinks 100,000 cases is possible, noting 'We will follow the market as to future production.' Rolland and his partners are aware they may have a big winner on their hands with Clos de los Siete, which means that consistency is key. 'In many ways it is more difficult to make 50,000 cases than 10,000 because you have to take care of everything before blending,' he said. 'With small production, a winemaker has the luxury of selecting from many parcels of grapes and wines; with big production, you have to get the best on a large scale right away. And with global export, the labels cannot have any variance or mistakes about what's in the bottle.' Rolland chose Argentina because of its terroir, labor costs, and the open- mindedness of the New World. And he loves the sunshine, which builds up the sugars that convert into 14- plus percent alcohol. 'When you have that much sun, you don't need or want to manipulate the wine to have more alcohol,' he said. 'It's the natural way of the fermentation.' Controversy may yet swirl around Rolland and his methods, but Clos de los Siete proves that he can make a serious red wine to rival cult wines 10 times the price. At least he can with 50,000 cases. When Clos de los Siete gets to 100,000 cases, things should get interesting. _ _ _ John Mariani writes on wine for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News. "
1,"Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad flouted any more United Nations sanctions on his nuclear program as illegal Saturday, insisting he will not submit to any such pressure based on the United States and Britain 'lying' about the evidence. The Iranian leader, wrapping up two days of talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, lambasted the Western allies for pressing for another round of U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran. Ahmadinejad let loose when asked by an Associated Press reporter to discuss his effort to evade more U.N. sanctions by meeting with Uganda, a non-permanent member of the 15-nation council. The council is preparing to consider a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran for its nuclear defiance. 'The nuclear issue of Iran has turned into a big test for the entire world,' Ahmadinejad said, adding that the U.S. and Britain 'say they are concerned about the building of a nuclear bomb, but they are lying like the other previous lies.' He was referring to unsubstantiated U.S. claims that Saddam Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction, a key Bush administration rationale for the 2003 Iraq war. An exhaustive search turned up no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or any evidence there was an active program to develop it. 'The measures that have been taken or are going to be taken by the United States and its allies in the U.N. Security Council lack the legal validity,' Ahmadinejad said. 'We do not submit, and we do not accept any kind of pressures. And we do not follow the illegal decisions. We think by issuing resolutions against us, Mr. Obama will suffer more.' Obama gained the presidency on the premise he would make a 'change in the tough behavior' of the Bush administration, Ahmadinejad said, but 'the fact that he's going to follow, to take decisions against the Iranian people, is an end to his stature.' Obama has been pressing for more economic sanctions against Iran because of its alleged failure to comply with its responsibilities as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Obama has said Iran cannot be allowed to become a nuclear weapons state. Russia and China until recently had blocked attempts by the U.S., Britain and France, the three other permanent Security Council members, to introduce new sanctions. But Russia recently expressed a readiness to support 'smart' sanctions that do not target the Iranian people, while China appears willing if the drafts submitted by the West are watered down. Museveni, for his part, walked a fine line between seeking new investment from Iran while risking alienating the West. Uganda, he said, has not yet ruled out the possibility of voting for sanctions against Iran. 'We are not idiots of anybody,' he said. 'So after we have got the facts, we will consult our African brothers, and see what position we will take.' Iran, one of several nations vying to build an oil refinery for Uganda's untapped potential, has been under harsh criticism from Western nations for pressing ahead with uranium enrichment programs it says are to produce nuclear energy. The West fears the militant Islamic state could develop nuclear weapons. But as part of its diplomatic offensive, Iran has agreed to give the U.N. nuclear monitoring agency greater inspection and monitoring rights to a sensitive site where it is enriching uranium to higher levels. The Iranian and Ugandan presidents, as part of their joint communique, said they were committed to disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But they also said developing countries should have the right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Iran began enriching uranium to near 20 percent two months ago and says it will be turned into fuel rods for research reactors that manufacture medical isotopes for cancer patients. It says it was forced to take this step because major powers would not compromise over a moribund plan that would have supplied the rods from abroad. The International Atomic Energy Agency had pushed in vain for greater access to the enrichment operation since the start of the project. Ahmadinejad said Saturday that IAEA would have 'a commitment and the obligation to provide the enriched uranium of 20 percent for our research reactor, but we have accepted to exchange fuels with them. The proposal is still on the table.' "
1,"Iraqi forces acting on tips Wednesday arrested an al-Qaida-linked member of a Sunni paramilitary group who was believed to be a mastermind of the assassination of a prominent Sunni lawmaker in Baghdad, officials said. The announcement came less than a week after Harith al-Obeidi, the leader of the largest Sunni bloc in parliament, was gunned down as he left a mosque following Friday prayers in Baghdad. The assailant died after detonating a grenade as guards gave chase. Al-Obeidi's death raised fears of increased violence as U.S. troops face a June 30 deadline to withdraw from urban areas in line with a security pact that calls for their full withdrawal from the country by 2012. The agreement allows the Iraqis to ask for the Americans to help, but Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki rejected that option in an interview published Wednesday in a French newspaper. 'We will not ask them to intervene in combat operations or in operations related to maintaining public order,' al-Maliki told Le Monde. He said the government would only ask for U.S. logistical support 'to transport our troops ... because we no longer have planes.' Police commandos wearing black masks and helmets descended on the western Baghdad neighborhood of Ghazaliyah and stormed the suspect's house while he was eating lunch with his wife and three children. The troops handcuffed and blindfolded the man, searched the house, then escorted him to their Humvees parked nearby. The operation lasted about 15 minutes, according to an Associated Press photographer at the scene. Brig. Gen. Numan Dakhil Jawad, the commander of the quick reaction force that staged the raid, said the apprehended suspect was a reputed member of an al-Qaida front group who had joined the local Awakening Council. The suspect was identified as a 45-year-old mosque guard named Ahmed Abid Uwaid. Awakening Councils are mainly Sunni groups, including many former insurgents, who joined forces with the Americans, promising to renounce violence and fight al-Qaida. The movement was initially funded by the Americans and is considered a key factor in a dramatic drop in violence over the past two years. A high-ranking Iraqi security official confirmed the arrest of a suspect linked to al-Qaida in Iraq. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release the information, said the suspect was linked to an unidentified lawmaker. The arrest was based on tips received over the past several days, including one from the owner of the pistol used in the assassination, the official said, adding the pistol's owner had also had been arrested. Interior Minister spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf has denied the report. Shiite and Sunni politicians have said al-Obeidi's killing was the latest strike in a bid to stoke sectarian violence ahead of the U.S. withdrawal and national elections scheduled for Jan. 30. Al-Obeidi, an outspoken advocate of prisoners' rights, and a bodyguard were shot to death as they left a mosque in a heavily guarded area in the former insurgent stronghold of Yarmouk. The 47-year-old lawmaker was at the center of a stormy parliamentary debate over claims of torture in Iraqi jails and some lawmakers raised suspicion that his slaying may have been linked to his campaign on behalf of detainees. But the Interior Ministry has said the evidence so far indicates al-Qaida in Iraq was behind the attack. The Sunni terror network and other insurgents have frequently targeted other Sunnis who are perceived as cooperating with the U.S.-backed government's efforts to promote national reconciliation. Al-Obeidi took the helm of the Iraqi Accordance Front -- which holds 44 seats in the 275-member parliament -- in May after his predecessor, Ayad al-Samarraie, became the parliamentary speaker. He was the fourth Iraqi member of parliament to be killed since the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. ------ Associated Press Writer Helene Goupil in Paris contributed to this report. "
1,"Evaporation blamed on global warming has reduced Lake Titicaca, one of the world's highest navigable lakes, to its lowest level since 1949, authorities said Thursday. Diminished rainfall and a rise in solar radiation have in the past four years led to critically low water levels that now threaten fish spawning areas and plant life, the Lake Titicaca Authority said in a statement. Titicaca's waters have dropped 81 centimeters (2.65 feet) since April and flora and fauna are apt to suffer damage if they drop another 30 centimeters (one foot), the statement said. Navy Capt. Jorge Ernesto Espinoza told ATB television that South America's largest lake is receding by 2 to 3 centimeters (about an inch) a week. The lake, straddling Bolivia and Peru at 3,800 meters (12,493 feet) elevation, is an 8,400 square kilometer (3,240 square mile) oasis on an arid high plain an hour's drive from the Bolivian capital, La Paz. The lake is fed by rainfall and melt water from glaciers, which scientists say are shrinking rapidly due to global warming and could disappear altogether by mid-century. About 2.6 million people depend on the lake for their sustenance. The Titicaca Authority says 95 percent of the lake's inflow is now evaporating. One reason is that the area's rainy season has been reduced from six to three months, said Felix Trujillo, chief of Bolivia's National Meterological and Hydrological Service. He said this year's rainy season is expected to begin in mid-November. The drought has prompted water rationing in some Bolivian cities. Environment Minister Rene Orellana said Bolivia needs $1 billion over the next seven years to build reservoirs that will guarantee an adequate water supply. "
1,"U.S. officials say lax security at sophisticated Indian laboratories could make them targets for terrorists seeking biological weapons, according to comments made public in a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable. The cable sent from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi in June 2006 says India's public health system is ill-prepared in the event of a biological attack from terrorists. While the government of India sees the likelihood of such an attack as remote, U.S. diplomats expressed concerns that Indian labs could be the source of material for a biological attack elsewhere. The cable marked confidential was obtained by WikiLeaks and posted Friday on the Website of the British newspaper The Guardian. "
1,"BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces 'massive' public protests this fall as demonstrators attempt to derail her plan to prolong the use of nuclear power, the co-leader of the Green Party says. A movement that includes clean-energy businesses, doctors and students is preparing to confront Merkel over the planned extension of the running time of nuclear plants by an average of 12 years, Claudia Roth, co-chairwoman of the Greens, said in an interview Thursday. While the movement has echoes of the 1970s and 1980s rallies that gave rise to the Green Party, Merkel has awakened a 'new dimension' of opposition, Roth said. 'I can guarantee that this government has never experienced protests along the lines of what's coming,' Roth said in a phone interview from a party convention in the western city of Mainz. 'They won't be able to ignore it.' Germany's opposition groups are stepping up their campaign against nuclear power as Merkel seeks to steer the bill granting the extension through parliament. Her Cabinet is set to ratify the energy plan on Sept. 28. While she can rely on her majority to push the plan through the lower house, legal opinion is divided on whether Merkel can bypass the upper chamber, the Bundesrat, where her bloc is outnumbered by the opposition. Opposition Social Democrats have threatened legal challenges if she attempts to circumvent the Bundesrat. Merkel's popularity has sagged since her re-election a year ago. The ruling coalition dropped one percentage point to 36 percent support in a Forsa poll Wednesday, more than 12 points below its result in last year's vote. The Greens gained two points to 21 percent, the party's highest poll rating ever. It was the Greens, then led by Joschka Fischer, who helped author the phase-out of nuclear energy by about 2022 in a coalition with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats in 2002. 'The government is suffering not only on the nuclear issue, but also in other political areas,' said Hans-Juergen Hoffmann, head of Berlin-based pollster Psephos. With Merkel set overhaul health-care and cut spending on defense while facing further repercussions from Europe's debt crisis, the risk to her government 'is already recognizable in the political atmosphere and what you see in the polls.' A Sept. 18 demonstration, organized by anti-nuclear groups including Campact.de, will feature a march by tens of thousands of protesters to the Reichstag and a symbolic 'encircling' of the government quarter in Berlin, Campact director Christoph Bautz said by phone. Further 'huge protests' are planned in Gorleben, a nuclear-waste dump, and Stuttgart, Roth said. In Merkel's nuclear plan, she squelched the bickering between her Christian Democratic-led bloc and Free Democratic Party coalition partners to forge agreement on an extension of the licenses held by Germany's 17 atomic plants. The accord was excoriated by the opposition and activists as a giveaway to industry and harmful to the environment. Merkel spent this week defending the deal negotiated with the four main energy producers. More than half of the profit from extending plant running times will be put into renewable- energy development and the budget, Merkel said Monday. The government's plan is a betrayal of Germany's 'consensus' to exit nuclear energy, said Roth. That has bolstered the current protests beyond the traditional activist base to reach different age groups, church bodies and small businesses specialized in renewable-energy technologies who see their livelihoods at risk. 'The protests are much broader now -- they include a lot of young people who now know that nuclear power doesn't create jobs, but eliminates jobs,' Roth said. 'It's not just the old fighters who are out there protesting, but a lot of young people as well. Old and new movements have come together.' "
1,"Austrian authorities say an 83-year-old murderer has been caught in Poland after she disappeared from her apartment. Bronislawa Jarosz, a Polish citizen, was convicted of beating her neighbor to death in the Austrian town of Korneuburg in 2007 and sentenced to 18 years behind bars. She was freed after serving 10 months because she was deemed too sick to stay, but a recent exam found her fit enough to be in prison. Prosecutors issued a European arrest warrant when she couldn't be found after her exam. Austrian police spokesman Alexander Marakovits said Tuesday that Jarosz is being detained in a hospital in the Polish city of Krakow, but did not provide further details. Polish authorities could not immediately comment on the matter. "
1,"Haitians piled bodies along the devastated streets of their capital Wednesday after the strongest earthquake hit the poor Caribbean nation in more than 200 years crushed thousands of structures, from schools and shacks to the National Palace and the U.N. peacekeeping headquarters. Untold numbers were still trapped. The devastation was so complete that it seemed likely the death toll from Tuesday afternoon's magnitude-7.0 quake would run into the thousands. France's foreign minister said the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission was apparently among the dead. International Red Cross spokesman Paul Conneally said an estimated 3 million people may have been affected by the quake and that it would take a day or two for a clear picture of the damage to emerge. Aftershocks rattled the city of 2 million people as women covered in dust clawed out of debris, wailing. Stunned people wandered the streets holding hands. Thousands gathered in public squares singing hymns. People pulled bodies from collapsed homes, covering them with sheets by the side of the road. Passersby lifted the sheets to see if a loved one was underneath. Outside a crumbled building the bodies of five children and three adults lay in a pile. The United States and other nations began organizing aid efforts, alerting search teams and gathering supplies that will be badly needed in the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. The international Red Cross and other aid groups announced plans for major relief operations. 'Haiti has moved to center of the world's thoughts and the world's compassion,' said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was clear tens of thousands lost their homes and many perished in collapsed buildings that were flimsy and dangerous even under normal conditions. 'The hospitals cannot handle all these victims,' Dr. Louis-Gerard Gilles, a former senator, said as he helped survivors. 'Haiti needs to pray. We all need to pray together.' A young American aid worker was trapped for about 10 hours under the rubble of her mission house before she was rescued by her husband, who told CBS's 'The Early Show' that he drove 100 miles (160 kilometers) to Port-au-Prince to find her when he learned of the quake. Frank Thorp said he dug for more than an hour to free his wife, Jillian, and a co-worker, from under about a foot of concrete. Even relatively wealthy neighborhoods were devastated. An Associated Press videographer saw a wrecked hospital where people screamed for help in Petionville, a hillside district that is home to many diplomats and wealthy Haitians as well as the poor. At a destroyed four-story apartment building, a girl of about 16 stood atop a car, trying to peer inside while several men pulled at a foot sticking from rubble. She said her family was inside. 'A school near here collapsed totally,' Petionville resident Ken Michel said Wednesday after surveying the damage. 'We don't know if there were any children inside.' He said many seemingly sturdy homes nearby were split apart. U.N. peacekeepers, many of whom are from Brazil, were distracted from aid efforts by their own tragedy: Many spent the night hunting for survivors in the ruins of their headquarters. 'It would appear that everyone who was in the building, including my friend Hedi Annabi, the United Nations' Secretary General's special envoy, and everyone with him and around him, are dead,' French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Wednesday, speaking on RTL radio. At least four Brazilian soldiers were killed and five injured, Brazil's army said. Jordan's official news agency said three of its peacekeepers were killed and 21 were injured. A state newspaper in China said eight Chinese peacekeepers were known dead and 10 were missing -- though officials later said the information was not confirmed. Some 9,000 peacekeepers have been in Haiti since 2004, including 1,266 Brazilians. Much of the National Palace pancaked on itself, but Haiti's ambassador to Mexico, Robert Manuel, said President Rene Preval and his wife survived the earthquake. He had no details. The quake struck at 4:53 p.m., centered 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of Port-au-Prince at a depth of only 5 miles (8 kilometers), the U.S. Geological Survey said. USGS geophysicist Kristin Marano called it the strongest earthquake since 1770 in what is now Haiti. Most of Haiti's 9 million people are desperately poor, and after years of political instability the country has no real construction standards. In November 2008, following the collapse of a school in Petionville, the mayor of Port-au-Prince estimated about 60 percent of buildings were shoddily built and unsafe in normal circumstances. Tuesday's quake was felt in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and in eastern Cuba, but no major damage was reported in either place. With electricity knocked out in many places and phone service erratic, it was nearly impossible for Haitian or foreign officials to get full details of the devastation. 'Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken,' said Henry Bahn, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official visiting Port-au-Prince. 'The sky is just gray with dust.' In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that U.S. Embassy personnel were 'literally in the dark' after power failed. 'They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,' he said. President Barack Obama offered prayers for the people of Haiti and said the U.S. stood ready to help. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. was offering full assistance -- civilian and military -- and a national organization of registered nurses called for nurse volunteers to provide care in Haiti. Elizabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s humanitarian office, said it was working with independent aid agency Telecoms Sans Frontieres to get phone lines working again -- a key element in organizing relief efforts. Venezuela's government said it would send a military plane with canned foods, medicine and drinking water and provide 50 rescue workers. Mexico, which suffered an earthquake in 1985 that killed some 10,000 people, planned to send doctors, search and rescue dogs and infrastructure damage experts. Italy said it was sending a C-130 cargo plane Wednesday with a field hospital and emergency medical personnel as well as a team to assess aid needs. France said 65 clearing specialists, with six sniffer dogs, and two doctors and two nurses were leaving. Edwidge Danticat, an award-winning Haitian-American author was unable to contact relatives in Haiti. She sat with family and friends at her home in Miami, looking for news on the Internet and watching TV news reports. 'You want to go there, but you just have to wait,' she said. 'Life is already so fragile in Haiti, and to have this on such a massive scale, it's unimaginable how the country will be able to recover from this.' ------ Associated Press videographer Pierre Richard Luxama in Haiti and AP writers David Koop and Olga R.

1,"Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says the masterminds of the Moscow subway bombings must be 'dragged out of the sewer' and that catching them is, if nothing else, a matter of pride for investigators. Putin, who is thought to carry the most power in Russia, said on television Tuesday that he is sure the organizers of Monday's attacks, which killed 39 people, would be found. Putin said, 'We know that they are lying low, but it is already a matter of the pride of law enforcement agencies to drag them out of the sewer and into broad daylight.' Officials allege the masterminds are in the country's restive North Caucasus region. Five victims remain in critical condition and more than 70 are still hospitalized after the twin suicide bombings.

1,"Back when singer-songwriter John Hiatt was passing through towns in the early '80s, cracking wise on small club tours, the last thing fans wanted to see were signs that he was growing up. In some ways, that still holds true. Of course, Hiatt has become one of the most highly acclaimed and widely covered tunesmiths in pop, but success hasn't dulled his wit or cooled his rock and blues passions. On his new album, 'The Open Road,' Hiatt combines vivid lyrics with the thumping rhythms that stirred his Indiana adolescence. With a blast of guitar distortion and ghostly harmonies, the title and opening cut introduces a Southern gothic tale that comes into focus instantly ('Shrunken head and Mardi Gras beads/ Hanging on a rearview mirror that bleeds'). Then comes 'Haulin',' a free-spirited travelogue reminiscent of Chuck Berry's 'Promised Land,' followed by 'Like a Freight Train' and 'My Baby,' a pair of slide guitar blues songs that are by turns haunting and boisterous. The album's most memorable lyric, however, is also the most ominous. 'What Kind of Man' is a noirish portrait of duplicity: 'You see the man who loves you/ You see the man you love/ But I have hidden claws/ Inside these gloves.' Restlessness, in one form or another, inspires the album's best tunes, as does a band that amplifies Hiatt's personality and soul. Grown up? Fired up is more like it. "
1,"A Chinese student has questioned the Dalai Lama's version of conditions in Tibet. During a question-and-answer session Thursday at Miami University in southwest Ohio, the student said she had visited Tibet and didn't see the oppression that the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader has decried. He responded that she needed to do more investigation of what has happened in Tibet the past 60 years and its entire history. The Dalai Lama fled in 1959 after the Chinese crushed an uprising. The Dalai Lama also noted that Tibetan students held protests earlier this week. He said such demonstrations show discontent. He earlier got a firsthand look at Miami's efforts to digitally preserve Tibetan culture and received an honorary doctorate before a sold-out lecture. "
1,"Sweden's brush with terror after a suicide bomber on Dec. 11 detonated himself before executing a planned strike in central Stockholm has eroded lawmaker resistance to pushing through tougher surveillance laws. The opposition Social Democrats will no longer block a government proposal to let the Swedish Security Service use information from the National Defense Radio Establishment, said Morgan Johansson, chairman of parliament's justice committee. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which entered parliament for the first time in September elections, want lawmakers to address 'violent Islamist extremism' in an extraordinary session, party spokesman Martin Kinnunen said. 'Routines will be sharpened and that's something we will all have to accept,' said Bo Huldt, a professor in security policy at the Stockholm-based National Defense College, in a Dec. 13 interview. 'It may mean restrictions for us all regarding where we can move around, how many people can attend meetings or gatherings and more police presence at meetings.' Sweden has so far had laxer security laws than neighboring Denmark and Norway. The largest Nordic country has tried to balance maintaining democratic freedoms with adequate protection of its citizens, says Anders Thornberg, director of operations at the Swedish Security Service. After the weekend's bomb blasts, police will 'have to reconsider' this stance, he said. 'It is impossible in a Western society to know what everyone is doing,' Thornberg said in an interview. 'But of course, when this is solved, later on, we have to reconsider and evaluate when we see what we have done and if we can do something better.' Johansson, a former Social Democrat health minister, said laws may be changed to allow preventive action. The police need the tools to uncover 'potential perpetrators,' he told broadcaster SVT. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told SVT security police need 'to be ahead of the game, to prevent' terror attacks. Unlike neighboring Denmark, which became a target of Islamist anger in 2006 after its biggest newspaper published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, Swedish police until October had deemed the threat of any terrorist attack to be 'low.' Police then raised the alert level to 'elevated,' though they said there was no 'imminent' threat of any attack. Anders Hall, Head of Planning at the Ministry of Justice in Stockholm, said tracking religious extremists remains difficult, even after Sweden's security service raised its staff to 1,000 from about 800 in 2005. Sweden's laws protecting freedom of speech and freedom of association mean police follow 'tight regulations' when tracking demographic groups, Hall said in an interview. 'These regulations are part of the Swedish constitution and are firmly in place,' Hall said. There are almost 200 Islamist extremists in Sweden who assent to violent acts, the security service said in a report on its website Wednesday. While Islamist extremism and radicalization exist in Sweden and 'shouldn't be underestimated,' it's a 'limited phenomenon' that should be handled through preventive measures, the report said. Sweden has about 500 troops in Afghanistan, serving as part of the International Security Assistance Force. Swedish artist Lars Vilks drew anger from some Muslims after newspaper Nerikes Allehanda published one of his drawings that put Mohammad's head on a dog's body in 2007. Sweden's parliament, the Riksdag, passed a bill Wednesday extending the mandate for troops in Afghanistan to the end of next year after Reinfeldt's government coalition gained support from the Social Democrats in the vote. The mandate would have expired early next year. Shortly before the weekend's explosions, police and a local news agency received an e-mail with recordings in Swedish and Arabic from a man who said it was 'time to strike' because a 'war was being waged against Islam.' Sweden says it's coordinating its investigation of the blasts with Britain. In the recording, the suspect expresses anger against Vilks and the Afghan deployment. He apologizes to his family for lying about his trips to the Middle East, saying he went 'for Jihad.' Police on Dec. 13 said they were almost certain the suicide bomber was 28-year- old Taimour Abdulwahab. Britain's Guardian newspaper said Abdulwahab was an Iraqi-born Swede who obtained a Bachelors of Science in sports therapy from the University of Bedfordshire in 2004. 'This man has been very skillful in avoiding contacts with known terrorists,' Thornberg said. 'He has been very skilful in handling his preparations for this case so he hasn't shown up on our radar.' Sweden will get help from the FBI, which has sent seven experts on explosives to help probe the Dec. 11 blasts, police said on Dec. 13. Swedish police said Abdulwahab was probably targeting an area where he could hurt 'as many people as possible,' before a failure in his equipment led to early detonation. According to Huldt, 'even though things went well this time and nobody else was hurt, it's still a failure,' of police. - With assistance from Niklas Magnusson in Stockholm, Christian Wienberg in Copenhagen and Josiane Kremer in Oslo.

1,"Center Timofey Mozgov had 25 points and 11 rebounds to lead defending champion Russia past Macedonia 71-69 and into the quarterfinals of the European basketball championship. Macedonia had a chance to tie the game in the closing seconds after Russia threw the ball away with 5.9 seconds to play. But Macedonia guard Dimitar Mirakovski's runner in the lane bounced out at the buzzer and Russia hung on for the win, despite shooting just 1 of 15 from behind the arc. Power forward Pero Antic scored 19 points and pulled down 10 boards to lead Macedonia, which was eliminated with the loss. In other Group E games later Tuesday, unbeaten France plays Greece, and Croatia takes on Germany with a spot in the quarterfinals on the line. The top four teams in Group E and Group F advance to the quarterfinals. "
1,"The U.S. would cancel a nuclear energy agreement with the United Arab Emirates if the Middle East nation were to violate any terms of the deal, an Obama administration official said Wednesday. Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, sought to convince lawmakers that the pact is designed to keep sensitive technology from flowing to Iran or allowing the UAE to develop atomic weapons. 'We have set a very high bar,' Tauscher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The administration approved plans in May to help the UAE become the first Arab country with a civilian nuclear power industry that would fuel its growing demand for electricity. The U.S. is promoting the deal as a counterweight to Iran's pursuit of atomic weapons and a model for others in the Middle East to follow. Under the pact, the UAE must import, rather than produce, fuel for its nuclear reactors. It also has committed not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel for plutonium, which is used in nuclear bombs. The agreement would run for 30 years and create the legal framework for the U.S. to transfer nuclear equipment, reactors and materiel for civil nuclear research to the UAE. The pact was signed in January by the departing Bush administration, which left the final decision to President Barack Obama. Congress has until Oct. 17 to pass legislation either amending or rejecting the deal. If no bill passes, the agreement goes into effect. Concerns have been raised about the UAE's history as a transshipment point for material intended for Iran's nuclear program. Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups have used financial networks in the UAE to launder money, critics also say. While the UAE has taken steps to combat terrorist financing and tighten its export control laws, it is too soon to enter into such a major deal, they said. The UAE has a 'long history of complicity or negligence regarding trade with Iran and other countries of concern,' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican. Tauscher said the UAE is a trusted ally and will follow the highest nonproliferation standards. 'This is not a risk reward situation,' Tauscher said. 'We think that this is a very good deal for us when it comes to nonproliferation and national security concerns.' The committee chairman, Rep. Howard Berman, a Democrat, said the agreement was 'the best one' the U.S. ever has negotiated with an ally. But he also had concerns about how aggressively the UAE has cracked down on controlling illegal shipments through its ports. "
1,"Prague zoo says one of its fearless honey badgers is on the run. Zoo spokeswoman Jana Ptacinska Jiratova says the female honey badger named Kaca escaped last week, when she probably climbed over a 1.6-meter (5.25-foot) high fence. Pavel Brandl, in charge of mammals at the Prague zoo, says the honey badger is considered the most fearless animal in the world. He fears that the small, furry carnivore that loves honey is unlikely to survive in the wild. Jiratova says the zoo has received a number of tips from Prague citizens about Kaca's possible whereabouts, but so far the search has been fruitless. Prague zoo is one of the few in the world where six honey badgers were born in captivity. The 10-year-old Kaca, who joined her partner Cert in Prague nine years ago, is the mother to all of them. "
1,"Marijuana use continues to increase among young people in the United States, according to an annual federally funded survey of drug, alcohol and cigarette use among U.S. youths. The proportion of eighth-graders who say they smoke marijuana daily increased from 1 percent to 1.2 percent between 2009 and 2010, while the rate among 10th- graders went from 2.8 percent to 3.3 percent, and among high school seniors from 5.1 percent to 6.1 percent, according to the Monitoring the Future Survey, which questioned 46,482 students from 396 public and private schools. Because cigarette smoking has been declining among high school seniors, marijuana is now more popular than cigarettes by some measures. In 2010, 21.4 percent of high school seniors had used marijuana in the past 30 days, while 19.2 percent had smoked cigarettes, according to the survey, which is conducted by the University of Michigan. 'These high rates of marijuana use during the teen and pre-teen years, when the brain continues to develop, places our young people at particular risk,' said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement. 'Not only does marijuana affect learning, judgment, and motor skills, but research tells us that about one in six people who start using it as adolescents become addicted.' The perception that regular marijuana smoking is harmful decreased among 10th- graders from 59.5 percent to 57.2 percent and among 12th-graders from 52.4 percent to 46.8 percent in 2010. 'We should examine the extent to which the debate over medical marijuana and marijuana legalization for adults is affecting teens' perceptions of risk,' Volkow said. 'We must also find better ways to communicate to teens that marijuana use can harm their short-term performance as well as their long-term potential.' The use of the drug Ecstasy also increased, according to the survey, with 2.4 percent of eighth-graders and 4.7 percent of 10th-graders saying they had used the drug in the past year. That's up from 1.3 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. Although abuse of the prescription drug Vicodin during the past four years decreased among high school seniors from 9.7 percent to 8 percent, the use of OxyContin, another prescription opiate, stayed about the same for 12th-graders at 5.1 percent. In a bit of good news, binge drinking continued to drop. Among high school seniors, 23.2 percent reported having had five or more drinks in a row during the past two weeks, down from 25.2 percent in 2009 and a drop from the peak of 31.5 percent in 1998. "
1,"BOSTON - Harvey Collier, a mortgage broker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., says he gets as many as 10 calls a month from people planning to default on their loans. The twist: They first want financing to buy another home. Real estate professionals call it 'buy and bail.' This involves acquiring a new house before the buyer's credit rating is ruined by walking away from the old one because it's 'underwater,' or worth less than the mortgage. It's an attempt to escape payments on a home whose value may never recover while securing a new property, often at a lower price with a more affordable loan. The practice, which constitutes fraud if borrowers lie on loan applications, is continuing even after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest U.S. mortgage- finance companies, beefed up standards to prevent it, according to brokers such as Collier and Meg Burns, a staffer at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Whether driven by greed or desperation, the persistency of buy and bail underscores the lingering impact of the worst housing crash since the Great Depression. 'People were holding on, hoping the market would turn around,' said Collier, who won't work with applicants who intend to go into foreclosure. 'But now they're giving up because there's no light at the end of the tunnel in places like Florida.' The value of U.S. homes fell by a third from 2006 to 2009, as tracked by the SP /Case-Shiller index. In some areas, the losses were bigger. Prices declined 56 percent in Las Vegas, 55 percent in Phoenix and 49 percent in Miami. Such declines have left more than a fifth of single-family homeowners with mortgages underwater in the second quarter, according to a report this week by Zillow.com, a Seattle-based data company. About 12 percent of residential-loan defaults in February were strategic, meaning homeowners decided not to make payments even though they could afford to, New York-based Morgan Stanley said in an April report. The rate, which was about 4 percent in mid-2007, probably will increase even if home values start to recover, said Frank Pallotta, managing partner of Loan Value Group, a mortgage- consulting firm in Rumson, N.J. 'After home prices bottom, the borrower in a position of negative equity is able to quantify exactly how long it will take to recoup the loss, and may decide to walk away,' Pallotta said. Most likely to walk away are borrowers with the best credit scores and so-called jumbo loans that exceed the caps set for mortgages bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which range from $417,000 in most locations to $729,750 in high- cost areas, according to the Morgan Stanley report. People who choose to default typically have lost $100,000 or more in property value, said Brent White, a law professor at the University of Arizona. No data exist on strategic defaults done in tandem with buy-and-bail purchases. Buy and bail is most often pursued by people with big enough paychecks and low enough debt to qualify for two homes, according to Mark Goldman, a broker at Cobalt Financial Corp. in San Diego. That threshold is easier to meet since home prices retreated and mortgage rates fell to an all-time low, he said. The average U.S. rate for a 30-year fixed home loan dropped to 4.49 percent, the lowest in records dating to 1971, Freddie Mac said this month. "
1,"Despite warming relations and deepening trade ties, it is 'premature' to consider a meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou said in a Friday interview that set practical limits on his policy of engagement with the mainland. 'There's a long way to go before the two sides can find something in common politically,' said Ma, who has overseen a diplomatic and economic thaw with China that U.S. officials regard as of strategic significance, calming one of Asia's most acute potential flashpoints. Seen as a wayward province by the government in Beijing, Taiwan spent only a few of the past 115 years under the control of a government in China. It is currently governed by Ma's Nationalist Party, which fled China to Taiwan after the communist takeover in 1949. Though the United States and most other nations have not formally recognized Taiwan, the island has developed into an economic powerhouse and bustling two- party democracy under the protection of U.S.-supplied arms and an implicit guarantee to help if attacked. While Ma said he did not 'exclude the possibility' of meeting the head of China's government in the future, he said the focus was on maintaining the progress being made on trade, travel and government-to-government cooperation. The two sides, he said, have reached a workable 'status quo' _ with China setting aside vocal demands for unification, Taiwan dampening assertions of independence, and each more committed to keeping the peace. Ma ruled out, for example, attending a 2011 U.S.-hosted meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in Hawaii, suggested as a possible venue for a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Taiwan's participation in international organizations is often problematic, forcing its delegations to use different names, or to send lower-level officials to meetings of heads of state to avoid implied diplomatic recognition. 'It is premature and it would be very difficult' for Ma to join Hu at the meeting, he said. 'The most important thing is to lay the groundwork for institutionalized infrastructure between Taiwan and the mainland.' 'At the moment people do not believe that either unification or independence is a good choice. They prefer to maintain the status quo and let the two sides interact in an in-depth fashion and then leave the decisions to future generations. People here want to do business with the mainland, but they don't want to have the way of life over there.' Ma is up for re-election in 2012, and the Chinese leadership also will be undergoing a change. According to Taiwanese and other analysts, domestic politics alone make it unlikely that either side will risk a handshake with the other until those transitions are complete. But Ma was also adamant that he wants to continue deepening relations _ a process he thinks is necessary to secure Taiwan's economy, and which, he argues, will be at least a small prod on Beijing officials to liberalize their country's politics. A million mainland Chinese visitors are expected in Taiwan this year under loosened travel rules that were included among a dozen different agreements officials in Taipei and Beijing have signed since Ma took office two years ago. Those agreements also allowed direct air service between the two sides, the extradition of accused criminals and other practical steps. After an era in which the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) advocated a harder line with China _ and Chinese officials sometimes responded by firing missiles into nearby seas _ Ma said he will continue 'engaging in honest and flexible diplomacy.' He said the most important thing is to lay the groundwork for more agreements between the two. In particular, Taiwanese and Chinese officials are negotiating a free-trade pact Ma hopes will expand Taiwan's already large economic presence on the mainland. Perhaps a million Taiwanese live and work in China, a managerial and investment class that has invested an estimated $200 billion and relocated large portions of Taiwan's manufacturing capacity to China's lower-wage industrial enclaves. The DPP opposes the pact and in a recent televised debate pressed arguments that opening Taiwan to free trade with China will mean an even faster loss of jobs across the Taiwanese Straits. The free-trade pact with China 'is a reckless policy,' said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen. 'We are losing jobs to Chinese workers. The companies are making all the money in the world manufacturing in China and selling to the rest of the world.' But Ma argued that the agreement is needed for Taiwan to keep pace with other Asian countries whose economies are integrating quickly with China's _ and possibly to serve as a conduit for U.S. businesses looking for partners with ready access to the mainland. Taiwan is not expecting _ or demanding _ international recognition anytime soon, he said. But 'diplomatic isolation can be handled. Economic isolation can be fatal.' "

1,"Bob Sheppard, the Yankee Stadium announcer known as the 'Voice of God' for his resonant introductions of baseball players from Joe DiMaggio to Derek Jeter that echoed within the Bronx ballpark and carried well beyond to the elevated subway platforms, has died. He was 99. Sheppard died Sunday morning at his home in Baldwin, New York, the Yankees said in an e-mailed statement. Sheppard's perfect diction and unhurried intonations made their debut at the Yankees' baseball season opener of April 17, 1951 -- and were heard at every opening-day game until April 11, 2006, when he dislocated his artificial hip. A bronchial infection led to a lengthy hospital stay at the end of the 2007 regular season, and the Yankees said he never returned to announce another game. By then, Sheppard's voice had reverberated in New York's most-famous stadium for more than half a century and in more than 4,400 games. 'Your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen,' Sheppard would demand, whether asking fans to rise for the national anthem or to note: 'Now batting for the Yankees, the shortstop, No. 2, Derek Jeter, No. 2.' A recording of Sheppard's introduction of Jeter now plays at the player's request and has since Sheppard's lengthy absence in 2007, the Yankees said Sunday. Fans and players alike paid heed to Sheppard's deep voice. 'When you think of Yankee Stadium, he's the first thing that comes to mind,' Jeter, the Yankee captain and shortstop, said in April 2006. 'It's not right playing here unless he's the one that's announcing.' Nor were Sheppard's admirers limited to the Yankees. 'Just hearing your name over the public-address system gives you a shot of adrenaline,' said ex-Met Mike Piazza, who swatted a home run at Yankee Stadium in 2000 with Sheppard's voice still ringing in his ears. Sheppard was a New York high school speech teacher when he was hired as a public-address announcer for pro football games at Yankee Stadium in the late 1940s. He shifted to Yankee baseball after being assured it wouldn't interfere with his teaching career. 'The first rule of being a good public-address announcer is to have a steady job on the outside,' he said. Robert Leo Sheppard, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens, consistently refused to disclose his age; New York voter records listed his date of birth as Oct. 20, 1910. In addition to the Yankees, Sheppard was the public-address announcer for the New York Giants football team from 1956 until he retired from that job after the 2005 season. He played varsity football and baseball for St. John's University, where he earned a degree in speech in 1932. He also received a master's degree in speech from Columbia University. Sheppard was the chairman of the speech department of John Adams High School in Queens before becoming a professor of speech at St John's. He took equal pride in his longevity as an announcer and in adhering to a 'clear, concise, correct' style behind the microphone. 'You name it, I did it, and without emotion,' Sheppard said, 'which is amazing when you think about the public-address announcers in the world today. They are screamers.' Sheppard arrived early at games to check how ballplayers he didn't know pronounced their names, a professional courtesy that he had also extended to students in his high school classes. Aside from DiMaggio, whose name Sheppard said he enjoyed pronouncing, his first opening day lineup included Mickey Mantle, another player with a name the announcer said rolled enjoyably off his tongue because of its rhythm and alliteration. As for other players, Sheppard said he found pleasure in introducing multisyllabic names like Alfonso Soriano rather than names like, for instance, Steve Sax. One of Sheppard's most-exciting moments as a broadcaster occurred on Oct. 8, 1956. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Don Larsen was on the verge of pitching the first perfect game in World Series history. And then, Sheppard recalled, 'I had to introduce a pinch hitter, Dale Mitchell, for the Brooklyn Dodgers.' There ensued a few more tense minutes and then Mitchell was called out on strikes. As pandemonium broke out in the stadium, Sheppard said he exhaled, quietly, at last. With assistance from Dan Hart in Washington. "
1,"AMSTERDAM - A lawyer for Geert Wilders, a Dutch political leader who has agreed to support the country's minority government, challenged the impartiality of judges Monday at the first day of his trial over his comments about Muslims. Wilders' lawyer, Bram Moszkowicz, criticized Jan Moors, who presides over the three-judge panel, for comments on his client's refusal to testify. Wilders, founder and head of the Freedom Party, went on trial Monday for inciting hatred and insulting Muslims. 'You've given the impression' that 'we are no longer facing an unprejudiced judge, so I will challenge you,' Moszkowicz told the Amsterdam court. The trial was halted and other judges, led by Judge Frans Bauduin, will decide Tuesday whether a new panel should be chosen. Wilders, 47, is being prosecuted for calling the Koran 'fascist' and comparing it to Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf in a 2007 Dutch newspaper editorial, which led to complaints. A year later, he released the movie 'Fitna,' in which he calls on Muslims to rip out 'hate-preaching' verses from the book. Moors said the court 'reads newspapers and watches television nowadays' and that Wilders has been blamed by others for being 'good in taking a stand and then avoiding a discussion.' By remaining silent 'it seems you're doing that today as well.' 'I find it scandalous that the presiding judge interprets this and comments on it,' Wilders told the court. 'With this presiding judge and such a panel of judges, a fair trial isn't possible anymore.' The trial coincides with the formation of a new minority government led by the Liberal Party and Christian Democratic Alliance, which relies on Wilders' Freedom Party to pass legislation. The government plans to ban full-face Islamic veils, an issue for Wilders' party, which more than doubled its representation in parliament in June elections. 'With me, the freedom of speech of many, many Dutchmen is on trial,' Wilders told the court. 'I've said everything I have said and won't take a word of that back.' Prosecutors in 2008 initially decided against charging Wilders, saying his comments are part of the public debate and are covered by freedom of speech rules. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal last year overruled that decision. More than 40 people reported the editorial comments to the police while others complained about the film, prosecutors said. 'The Court of Appeal considers criminal prosecution obvious for the insult of Islamic worshippers,' when Wilders compared parts of Islam with Nazism, the appeals court ruled, forcing prosecutors to charge Wilders. 'Sowing hatred in a democratic system of law is so severe, that there's a public cause to draw a line in public debate.' Wilders, who has a bleached-blond bouffant hairstyle, is charged with insulting a group of people, inciting hatred and inciting discrimination with his comments, the prosecution said on its website. He faces as long as a year in prison or a fine of as much as $10,400, prosecutor spokesman Franklin Wattimena said. Wilders, who is under constant police protection, will plead via his lawyer on Oct. 19. Judges are then scheduled to rule on Nov. 4, according to the court's website. The Netherlands, the fifth-largest economy in the euro zone, has about 850,000 Muslims, forming 5 percent of the population, according to the Dutch statistics bureau's 2006 data. Most Muslims in the country are of Turkish or Moroccan origin. 'The Islamization of Europe continues all the time but the West has no strategy for dealing with the Islamic ideology, because our elites say that we must adapt to them rather than the other way round,' Wilders said in a speech Oct. 1 in Berlin at a gathering of the newly founded anti-Islam party called 'Die Freiheit,' which is German for 'freedom.' "
1,"The Florida pastor who planned to burn Korans on the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks Saturday now says he won't 'ever' burn Islam's holy book. Terry Jones, who arrived in New York City Friday night, is still seeking a meeting with Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who plans to build an Islamic center near the World Trade Center site. The pastor said in an interview on NBC's 'Today Show' that no meeting has been scheduled. 'We feel that God is telling us to stop,' Jones said. 'And we also hope that with us making this first gesture, not burning the Koran, to say, 'No, we're not going to do it, not today, not ever, we're not going to go back and do it, it is totally canceled.' 'We hope that through that maybe that will open up a door to be able to talk to the imam about the Ground Zero mosque.' Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Fla., said on 'Today' that the goal of his protest had been accomplished and it wasn't a publicity stunt. 'We feel that whenever we started this out one of our reasons was to show, to expose that there is an element of Islam that is very dangerous and very radical,' Jones said. 'I believe that we have definitely accomplished that mission.' He said he 'can absolutely guarantee' there will be no Koran burning at his church, even if the Islamic center near Ground Zero is built. Jones, who has acknowledged receiving more than 100 death threats, said he 'wasn't scared into calling off the burning.' President Barack Obama urged Jones to cancel the planned event, which sparked protests from Muslims around the world. Defense Secretary Robert Gates telephoned the pastor on Sept. 9 to ask him to call off the burning. 'The headline in the Muslim world will be Islam is under attack in America' if the proposed Islamic center is moved, Rauf said in an interview on ABC's 'This Week with Christiane Amanpour,' according to a partial transcript released by the network. 'This will strengthen the radicals in the Muslim world.' Ceremonies are being held Saturday at the three sites where terrorists crashed the hijacked planes in 2001, killing almost 3,000 people. The president spoke and participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Pentagon Memorial near Washington, while Vice President Joe Biden attended the World Trade Center site ceremony. First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush attended a service in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The World Trade Center ceremony began shortly before 8:46 a.m., the moment when a jetliner hijacked by members of the Muslim terrorist group al-Qaida smashed into the complex's north tower. A second airplane hit the south tower 17 minutes later. _ With assistance from Jeff Bliss, James Rowley, Nicholas Johnston and Catherine Dodge in Washington. "
1,"Two months after Craigslist promised to rid itself of advertisements placed by prostitutes, law enforcement officials say the online classified ad site is still in the business of selling sex. From a sheriff who has no intention of dropping his lawsuit to an attorney general who suggests that he and colleagues could further pressure the company to crack down on online prostitution, they say they are not through with Craigslist. 'It makes me wonder, do they really think I'm sort of stupid, some bobblehead who will think they changed it?' said Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who sued the San Francisco-based company earlier this year, calling it the nation's largest source of prostitution. 'They seem to insist on being cute and playing games (and) it's getting old.' Dart and others acknowledge that when the popular site pulled the plug on its 'erotic services' category and replaced it with a new 'adult services' section, it did away with the most graphic photographs. But they say there is no mistaking that sex is still being sold on the site. Ad after ad include photographs of scantily clad women in suggestive poses. Many offer massages or undefined services -- 'Just imagine what we could do,' reads one; 'Your wife or girlfriend won't do this for you, but we will,' reads another -- with listing prices that vary depending on how much time is required. In an e-mail, Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster dismissed Dart's lawsuit as a publicity stunt. 'The citizens of Cook County would arguably be better served if their sheriff spent his time addressing actual crime, rather than using the courts to generate personal publicity,' he wrote. Craigslist announced the changes in May amid mounting criticism of the ads and pressure to do something about them, which grew when a Boston-area area man was accused of fatally shooting a woman who placed an ad on the site. In addition to eliminating the 'erotic services' category, Craigslist promised to pre-screen all submissions to the new section and charge a fee. At the time, Dart's attorney said Craigslist's attorney told him the changes would render the lawsuit unnecessary and suggested Dart drop it. But there were questions then about the new category and how Craigslist would monitor it before allowing ads to be posted. Attorneys general said Craigslist had broken previous promises to monitor erotic ads. 'They are so thinly disguised, the real question is how they are permitted to be there if, in fact, the site is doing the screening and policing that they said they will do,' Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. Dan Gallagher, Dart's attorney in his lawsuit, said it is impossible to read many of the ads without concluding they are solicitations for prostitution -- such as ones he's seen from women who offer escort services for as little as 15 minutes. 'They (Craigslist) go to great lengths to say this is just a site so that people can meet one another to fulfill their romantic aspirations,' he said. 'I don't think having an escort for 15 minutes is a fulfillment of romantic aspirations.' Not only that, Gallagher said, the ads are becoming more obvious prostitution solicitations than they were even before 'adult services' replaced 'erotic services.' He said the euphemism for payment with phrases such as '150 roses' or '200 diamonds' that detectives monitoring the site once saw are disappearing. Now, he said, 'they give the price,' adding that dollar signs are increasingly popping up. Law enforcement officials say they have not received information about the Craigslist monitors, including how many there are, their qualifications and what type of ads they refuse to post. 'It's painfully obvious they're just blowing me off, humoring me,' said Dart, adding that Craigslist hasn't responded to his requests for information. Blumenthal said Craigslist has responded to his requests, and while he won't say what the company has told him, he said he is still waiting for answers to many of the same questions as Dart. 'At the very least what we want to know what is the list of prohibited terms, what are their criteria and procedures,' he said. 'If they need it, we will give them a list of terms.' Blumenthal said a coalition of 40 attorneys general was considering its options and could announce its next move by next week. As for Dart, his detectives are conducting sting operations and making arrests. "
1,"U.S.-led NATO troops in Afghanistan should be able to start handing off responsibility for security to the Kabul government sometime next year, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Tuesday. While stopping short of setting a firm deadline, Rasmussen's public declaration puts the security alliance in line with President Barack Obama's promise to begin pulling U.S. troops out in July 2011. But Rasmussen's latest prediction also reflects a growing realization by NATO that security conditions won't dramatically improve this year, as many hoped. At a NATO meeting in April, the secretary-general had said that handing over responsibility to the Afghans was a primary goal for this year. Some NATO members have already pulled out of the mission or plan to do so soon because of a lack of public support. NATO members were to meet in Lisbon, Portugal, in November to devise a plan for handing off control to the Afghans, including a timeline for various provinces and benchmarks to measure progress. Rasmussen said he believes security conditions have improved enough so a transition is possible. However, he said the precise timing of a drawdown will depend upon conditions on the ground. 'We will not leave until we finish our job,' he told reporters before a meeting with Obama at the White House. 'But it is very helpful to have this roadmap.' War commanders have been more reluctant to put a date on when Afghan troops might take control. Lt. Gen. Bill Caldwell, the head of NATO's training mission in Afghanistan, has said the alliance needs at least another year to recruit and train enough soldiers and police officers. Rasmussen said setting next year as a goal for beginning to wind down troop levels does not conflict with a request by Gen. David Petraeus, NATO's top commander in Afghanistan, for 2,000 more troops. Rasmussen said most of the 2,000 troops would be assigned to train Afghan security forces, in preparation for NATO's eventual withdrawal. 'Trainers are the ticket to transition,' he said. The Pentagon said Tuesday that the request for 2,000 more troops is a long-standing requirement for more trainers that will not be filled by U.S. forces. 'NATO will have to determine how to fill that requirement,' said Marine Col. Dave Lapan, a Defense Department spokesman. NATO has been eager to show progress in the war. The alliance's top commander in southern Afghanistan, British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, said this week that coalition troops will clear the area around the key city of Kandahar by December. In the meeting with Obama, the president thanked Rasmussen for NATO's efforts to promote peace and stability around the world, particularly in Afghanistan, the White House said. Obama and Rasmussen also discussed goals for the Nov. 19-20 NATO Summit in Lisbon. Although U.S. and NATO forces are expected to begin leaving Afghanistan next year, the U.S. government is expected to provide massive financial aid to the country for years to come. According to a NATO document, the United States expects to spend about $6 billion a year training and supporting Afghan troops and police after it begins withdrawing its own combat troops in 2011. ------ Associated Press writer Pauline Jelinek contributed to this report.

1,Bernanke: Fed ready to provide more aid to help economy; wrestles with how much. 
1,"Officials have lowered the number of fatalities in Monday's Washington subway system accident to seven, instead of the nine reported earlier. Mayor Adrian Fenty said officials are 'going to let the investigation run its course' and said that hopefully the number will not exceed seven by the end of the day. Fenty also said that two in the accident remain in critical condition in area hospitals. He said he has been told that their conditions are stable. The accident in Monday's rush hour on the Red Line of the Metro system was the worst in the 33-year history of the subway system in the U.S. capital city. "
1,"He was never charged in the case that sent his father to prison after thousands were swindled of their life savings, but for two years, the eldest son of disgraced financier Bernard Madoff still bore the toxic burden of a name that meant fraud to the world. On Saturday, the second anniversary of the day his father was arrested in the worst investment fraud in American history, Mark Madoff, 46, was found dead in the living room of his SoHo loft apartment in Manhattan. He was hanging from a black dog leash while his 2-year-old son slept nearby. People close to him said he was despondent over press coverage of his father's case, an ongoing criminal investigation of Madoff family members in the multibillion-dollar scheme and his struggle to rebuild his life. The intense scrutiny approaching the anniversary 'became too much for him,' said a person who had recent contact with him, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. Mark Madoff's wife, Stephanie, sent her stepfather to the couple's $6 million ((EURO)4.5 million) apartment after he e-mailed her at Disney World in Florida, where she was vacationing with their 4-year-old daughter. In the messages, he told her he loved her and that someone should check on their 2-year-old child, Nicholas, police said. He left no suicide note. The person who had recent contact with Madoff said he was struggling to find steady employment and was upset by coverage of his father's case, including a slew of stories in the past week about investor lawsuits. 'Mark Madoff took his own life today. This is a terrible and unnecessary tragedy,' his attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, said in a written statement. 'Mark was an innocent victim of his father's monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo.' Mark Madoff and his brother Andrew, who notified authorities their father had confessed to them the day before he was arrested on Dec. 11, 2008, have said they were unaware of his crimes. But they have remained under investigation and been named in the multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of profiting from the scheme. Another law enforcement official said Saturday that Madoff's arrest was not imminent, and that investigators pursuing possible charges against him, his brother and uncle hadn't contacted him for more than a year. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. A lawyer for Mark's mother, Ruth Madoff, said, 'She's heartbroken.' The lawyer, Peter Chavkin, had no further comment. Bernard Madoff, 72, swindled a long list of investors out of billions of dollars. He admitted that he ran his scheme for at least two decades, cheating thousands of individuals, charities, celebrities and institutional investors. Losses are estimated at around $20 billion ((EURO)15 billion), making it the biggest investment fraud in U.S. history. He is serving a 150-year prison term in North Carolina. The scandal has resulted in a half dozen arrests of Madoff associates and put a harsh light on members of the family, which has splintered since Madoff's arrest. Both brothers hadn't spoken to their parents since they turned their father in. The financier's brother, Peter, played a prominent role in the family's company. Mark and Andrew Madoff both worked on a trading desk at the firm, on a side of the business that wasn't directly involved in the Ponzi scheme. In February, Mark Madoff's wife asked a court to change her last name and the last names of their two children to Morgan, saying her family had gotten threats and was humiliated by the scandal. A year ago, the court-appointed trustee trying to unravel Bernard Madoff's financial affairs sued several relatives, including sons Mark and Andrew and Madoff's brother, Peter, accusing them of failing to detect the fraud while living lavish lifestyles financed with the family's ill-gotten fortune. The lawsuit accused Mark Madoff of using $66 million ((EURO)50 million) he received improperly to buy luxury homes in New York City, Nantucket and Connecticut. The trustee, Irving Picard, continues to try and recover money for investors. On Friday he filed a pair of lawsuits, a $900 million ((EURO)680 million) one against two accountants, and a civil racketeering case accusing offshore bankers of assisting Madoff in his fraud. Taken together, the actions seem to broaden the number of accomplices Picard thinks are responsible in Madoff's decades worth of fraud, even though the financier insisted to authorities that he acted alone. Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Traci Billingsley said Saturday she didn't have specific information on whether Bernard Madoff had been informed of his son's death or would be allowed to attend a service. In general, she said, inmates are informed of a relative's death as soon as the institution is made aware of it. The bureau does allow furloughs for prisoners to attend memorial services. A police officer stood guard in the lobby of Mark Madoff's 12-story luxury loft apartment building in SoHo on Saturday morning. Bystanders gawked as officials from the medical examiner's office removed the body early Saturday afternoon. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. Madoff graduated from the University of Michigan and was a licensed broker with his father's firm since 1987. He grew up in Roslyn, New York, and has two other children from a previous marriage, ages 18 and 16. He and his first wife, Susan, divorced about 10 years ago. She had no comment. Messages left with Andrew Madoff, Peter Madoff and the father-in-law Martin London were not returned Saturday. No one answered the door at Andrew Madoff's home in Greenwich, Connecticut, and access was blocked to the driveway of his brother's home in another part of town. The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. Ronnie Sue Ambrosino, who leads a group of Madoff victims who have been fighting for restitution in the case, said the death is just more evidence of the pain the case has wrought. 'It's sad. It's very, very sad that any life is taken,' she said. 'It's so wasteful.' She said she doubted any of the victims were taking pleasure in the Madoff family's sorrow. 'That's not going to help the Madoff victims find the justice and the restitution they deserve.' ------ Associated Press writers David B.

1,"Republican Christine O'Donnell's decisive Senate primary win in Delaware on Tuesday did more than position the 'tea party' movement against the GOP establishment. It pitted the tea party against itself. O'Donnell's stunning victory over nine-term Rep. Mike Castle came after a late boost of support from Tea Party Express and conservative heroes Sarah Palin and U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. Perhaps just as notably, however, O'Donnell won without a nod from two other conservative players that have had a hand in some of the year's biggest tea party wins: FreedomWorks and Club for Growth. That dynamic highlights the tension between some of the conservative forces at work this year. Some say defeating a moderate like Castle is the key to restoring conservative principles within the Republican Party. Others say such principles do no good if the party nominates candidates who can't win in November. O'Donnell's win Tuesday, they say, gives Democrats a new shot at holding Delaware's Senate seat - and probably puts a Republican takeover of the Senate out of reach. Conservatives in the latter camp said this week they declined to endorse O'Donnell because they didn't think she could win the seat in November against Democrat Chris Coons, the New Castle County executive. O'Donnell is a three-time Senate candidate with a history of financial problems; she also has made a number of misstatements during the campaign, including a claim that she won two of Delaware's three counties against then-Sen. Joe Biden in 2008, when in fact she won none. 'We're not sure what she stands for,' said David Keating, executive director of Club for Growth, a group that helped propel fiscally conservative 'tea party' candidates to victories in Utah and Nevada. 'Clearly there appears to be some personal baggage that she has, too. ... We looked at it and said, 'Well, it's possible, I suppose,' but there are a lot of other places where we'd have a much better chance of having our money make an impact and actually get a win.' FreedomWorks leaders said much the same this week. But Amy Kremer, chairman of Sacramento-based Tea Party Express, dismissed the probability of an O'Donnell loss in November, noting that such conventional wisdom proved wrong in the case of Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who won a special election in January, and Sharron Angle in Nevada, who remains neck and neck with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Even if a Castle win in November were likelier, it wouldn't have gotten conservatives any closer to blocking the Obama agenda, Kremer added - which is the most powerful reason of all to support O'Donnell, she said. 'We need to stand on principle,' Kremer said. 'If Mike Castle is not the most liberal Republican in Congress right now, he's one of them. He voted for TARP, cap and trade, cash for clunkers, I could go on and on. If we send him to Washington, he'll vote with Obama-Reid the majority of the time. We might get one vote out of him.' What remains to be seen is whether conservatives and even more established Republican leaders embrace O'Donnell now that she is their nominee. The National Republican Senatorial Committee made clear that the embrace will be lukewarm at best; the organization issued a terse congratulatory statement this week, but its chairman, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was silent, and strategists speaking on condition of anonymity said the committee will offer O'Donnell no financial support. "
1,"Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and many other moderates in California say a ballot proposition passed Tuesday that puts in place an unusual 'top two' primary election process could lead to a renaissance for centrist lawmakers. But it's almost certain to face a legal challenge _ and its impact remains an open question. Proposition 14, modeled on a similar law in Washington state, was approved by 8 percentage points. The measure will create a single, open primary in which the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election runoff, paving the way for Republican-vs.-Democrat, Democrat-vs.-Democrat or Republican- vs.-Republican contests. With nearly one in every eight U.S. House members coming from California, the proposition brings into increased national focus an experiment underway in Washington state since 2008. The campaign was spearheaded by Schwarzenegger and his moderate new lieutenant governor, Abel Maldonado, both Republicans. Maldonado, a former state senator, secured the ballot measure as part of an agreement to vote for the stalemated Democratic budget last year. Although two Republicans led the fight, their party isn't on board. 'Where this puts us is, we're going to disenfranchise 5.3 million Republican voters who should have a voice in who their nominee is,' state GOP spokesman Mark Standriff said. The Democratic Party is also opposed, with its resistance led by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. She argued that the measure would distort the political process. California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, a Democrat who hasn't taken sides, has said lawyers are girding for a challenge. The system in Washington state, which was approved in 2004 and put in place before the 2008 election, is still being challenged in federal court. And California's experiment with a nonpartisan 'blanket' primary in the 1990s was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. (A 'blanket' primary is similar to 'top two,' except that the top vote-getters from each party advance.) Rick Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and advocate of a 2004 'top two' proposition, said he expects this law to hold up, although it could be challenged on two counts _ because it hurts minor parties and independents and because it could lead to voter confusion. If it does survive a legal fight, some experts are asking whether the proposition will have its intended effect by adding moderate lawmakers. 'I would expect a small increase,' said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. 'There's just not much evidence that it adjusts the ideology of elected officials that much.' Bruce Cain, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said opponents of the 'top two' proposition were left with little choice but to let it pass given the anti-establishment political environment. 'They didn't think it was good time to try and defend the status quo,' Cain said. 'They think, through coordination this won't hurt them that much.' Independent Washington state pollster Stuart Elway said that his state has a relatively moderate government but that he wasn't sure whether it was the cause or a symptom of the state's historically unusual primary process. It had a 'blanket' primary for decades before adopting the 'top two.' 'We tend to think that because we had (a) blanket primary for 70 years and you could vote for either party in the primary that had a moderating influence,' Elway said, adding that 'top two' hasn't had much time to affect the state's politics. -0-< Staff writer Sandhya Somashekhar contributed to this report.

1,"Defending champion Tommy Robredo and Teimuraz Gabashvili won second-round matches in straight sets Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals at the Swedish Open. Robredo, a Spaniard seeded third in the clay-court tournament, beat Peter Luczak of Australia 6-2, 6-3. Gabashvili, an unseeded Russian, defeated Bjorn Pau of Germany 6-3, 6-2. Robredo is playing in Bastad for the ninth straight year. Two other Spaniards, Daniel Gimeno-Traver and fifth-seeded Nicolas Almagro, also won in straight sets to reach the second round. Gimeno-Traver ousted Federico Gil of Portugal 6-1, 6-4 and Almagro knocked off two-time major champion Marat Safin of Russia 6-3, 7-6 (6). Spanish players have won the last four Swedish Opens. Rafael Nadal was the winner in 2005, Robredo won his first title in 2006 and David Ferrer prevailed in 2007. Second-seeded Robin Soderling of Sweden was to play Kristof Vliegen of Belgium during an evening match -- only the second under lights in the tournament's 62-year history. Soderling received a first-round bye with the three other highest seeds. "
1,"The dark sedan backed into a spot next to the clubhouse at the Australian Masters, trunk open, waiting to whisk Tiger Woods to the airport. Lingering behind the car was a friend who was still wrestling with divided loyalties -- to Woods and his former wife. They approached each other, awkwardly at first, then shared a quick embrace and quiet words. Woods believes he finally is ready to move on after a self-destructive year that cost him his marriage, his mystique, millions in endorsements and, lastly, his No. 1 ranking. What remains are relationships to repair, along with his golf game. Still to come is Thanksgiving. 'I think it's going to be great,' Woods said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'I'm going to be with my family. My mom is going to be there. We're going to have a great Thanksgiving. We've turned the corner, turned the page, and it's time to move forward.' He was not playing dumb. Woods realizes the public might forever connect him and Thanksgiving with perhaps one of the most shocking downfalls in sports. It started with the National Enquirer story of an affair with a nightclub hostess. Then came the still mysterious, middle-of-the-night accident Nov. 27 when he drove his SUV over a fire hydrant and crashed into a tree beyond his driveway. His wife tended to him in the street, the back windows of the Cadillac Escalade bashed out with a golf club. On the 911 call was the chilling voice of his mother as she cried out, 'What happened?' One year later, that remains a relevant question. No one really knew much about Woods except that he dominated golf like no one had before. Within weeks, everyone knew too much. He was caught in a stunning web of infidelity, each indiscretion played out in public through voicemails, celebrity magazines, TV talk shows and even 'sexting' on a porn star's website. He became a regular in the National Enquirer. He was on front pages everywhere, long after the major championship season was over. Woods had spent 14 years carefully cultivating an impeccable image that brought him worldwide fame. Just like that, he went from being universally revered to roundly ridiculed. 'That's fine, totally fine,' Woods said in Australia, leaning forward on a leather sofa, elbows resting on his knees. 'I made my share of mistakes. People can look at that as what not to do, and if they choose to make fun of it, that's fine. I can't control that. All I know is that I can only control myself. 'And at that point in my life,' he said, 'I wasn't even able to do that.' ------ At a gala dinner in the Crowns Tower, the same hotel where the nightclub hostess was spotted a year earlier, Woods shared the stage with Shane Warne, known as the Tiger Woods of Australian cricket, on and off the pitch. Warne built his legend as a wicked leg spinner -- and a prolific womanizer. 'I think we've got a little bit in common,' Warne said with a smile, pausing for effect. 'I love golf, too.' Woods flashed an easy smile, breaking the brief tension in the room, and the audience quickly burst into laughter. It was the first time Woods has laughed publicly about such an embarrassing episode in his life, perhaps a sign that he had indeed turned the corner. On the golf course? Not quite. With two eagles on the last four holes of the Australian Masters, he at least managed fourth place, as good as he did all year. For the first time in his career, Woods didn't win a single trophy. Instead, he shot the highest 36-hole score of his career when he missed the cut at Quail Hollow, and the highest 72-hole score of his career when he nearly finished last at Firestone. In so many ways, it was a year no one could have predicted. 'Frenetic would be a word that comes to mind,' said Mark Steinberg, his agent at IMG. Steinberg was in California when he received word that Woods had been in an accident. He was aware of the National Enquirer story that had been released the day before Thanksgiving, and he was about to learn of an Us Weekly magazine story involving a cocktail waitress, and a voicemail from Woods suggesting his wife was onto them. For three months, that voicemail was the only time the public heard Woods speak. As his world was imploding, he only spoke through statements released on his website -- first a 'situation' that was embarrassing, then 'transgressions' he regretted with 'all my heart.' No one saw him. No one even knew where he was. Every expert in public relations and crisis management had a field day, blasting his management team for keeping him in hiding as rumors and innuendo filled the void. A year later, Steinberg isn't convinced it was mishandled. 'First of all, I don't think anyone has ever experienced this. There certainly was not a road map how to deal with this,' he said. 'We consulted with some people who deal with crisis management, and that was the consensus we got.' But there was more in play. What began with one mistress, maybe two, soon turned into many more. How many? Who knows? Even if some of the alleged mistresses were making it up, it's not as though the Woods' camp was in any position to deny it. 'You still had some of it true, some of it not true,' Steinberg said. 'Not everything had been revealed. So I'm not sure how he could come out before there was full resolution to everything. That's really the main reason.' Players were used to talking about Woods, about his great play and whether anyone could beat him. This was personal. It was messy. 'Last year at this stage, most of the players were going, 'How did we miss this?' Nobody saw it coming,' three-time major champion Padraig Harrington said. 'Like the public, we were enthralled by the whole 'How did he get away it?'' Geoff Ogilvy referred to Woods as a 'great unknown.' They saw him on the golf course, chased by dozens of photographers and thousands of fans. He was in the red shirt on Sunday, more times than not posing with a trophy. And then he was gone. 'What does he do when he goes home if he's not chipping and putting?' Ogilvy said. 'In a perverted sense, at least we got a perspective of what he does when he's not playing golf. That he actually does something other than play golf. 'I feel sorry for him in a way that it's not like it was for him,' he said. 'The golf world has been interesting the last 12 months. But at least the golf world made sense this time last year. It used to be such a given who was No. 1 in the world.' ------ The day after Thanksgiving started out like any other. Shoppers headed to the stores at dawn. Leftovers were on the table. Holiday decorations were being unpacked. College football was on television. Then came a crawler on the TV screen that was shocking: Tiger Woods seriously injured in a car accident. That was the initial report from the Florida Highway Patrol. And the news became more surreal with the developments that soon unfolded. The National Enquirer story suddenly had legs. Woods was treated and released from the hospital, and suspicions began stirring when troopers tried for three days to meet with him at his home. Four days after the accident, Us Weekly linked him to a cocktail waitress in California who said she had 300 text messages to prove their 31-month relationship. More allegations of affairs followed. 'I guess it was a few weeks or so before it really started to come out, and I just didn't know what to think,' Stewart Cink said. 'But I was, I think, in denial is one way I could describe my first reaction. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it.' Saturday Night Live made fun of him in skits, and Woods became easy fodder on everything from late shows to comedy acts in nightclubs, even a Disney stage performance. His image was plastered in airports around the world through an Accenture ad campaign, and, suddenly, no one could look at him the same way. All this in one week. 'It's the new way of the media world,' Woods said. 'It can happen very quickly. The world has gotten so much smaller. If this had happened to someone in the '60s or '70s, it wouldn't have been as big. It wouldn't have gone as global as fast. Our times have changed, and I totally get it.' There was still no sight of Woods, only statements on his website, the last one that he would take an indefinite leave from golf to try to save his marriage. Only later was it learned that he left before New Year's Day for a clinic in Mississippi. Perhaps the most compelling photo of him this year was in a hooded sweatshirt and shorts, holding a cup of coffee outside the Pine Grove Behavioral Health and Addiction Services, home of the Gentle Path sexual addiction program. What did he learn about himself? 'How far I had slipped away from where I was as a kid, from how I grew up,' he said. 'That was the sad part about it. It was a reality check and I learned a lot, unfortunately through a very painful process.' ------ Rarely a week passed on the PGA Tour without some mention of Woods. He managed to command the spotlight, which became irritating to some of his peers. First came an announcement Feb. 17, the opening round of the Match Play Championship, that Woods would break his silence two days later. The matches were ignored and Ernie Els criticized the timing as Woods being 'selfish.' A month later, Jim Furyk won for the first time in nearly three years, but as he reached the 18th green, two television networks were broadcasting Woods' first on-camera interviews. Furyk walked into his press conference reading a transcript of it. Els no longer harbors bitter feelings. They played together twice late in the year, at the TPC Boston and in Shanghai, and looked comfortable in each other's presence again. 'I feel for him, man,' Els said. 'I guess we were all kind of (ticked) off at him a little at the start of the year. The tour was brought into it a little bit because he was making statements while tournaments were being played. Look, I've known him since he was a teenager. I feel for him because of the public scrutiny he was under for a long time. I think he's getting through it now. He looks like he's in a better place. It looks like he's almost back to his normal self. 'He's trying to find his way, and I admire him for that. Because it's got to be the toughest thing in the world.' Woods said he was still mending relationships, but he won't say how or with whom. More obvious was how players looked at him as a competitor. When he returned at the Masters, and played in the second-to-last group, his name on the leaderboard didn't seem so intimidating. Woods tied for fourth. He never finished higher the rest of the year. 'If we're all brutally honest with ourselves, he's not had the year you'd think he would have had last year,' said Lee Westwood, who replaced Woods atop the world ranking. 'I don't want to say he's not the golfer he was, but at the same time, golf gives you one and takes away another. Form is very fickle in golf, and it can affect anybody. 'To all the players, it made him look a little more human. A bit more like us.' Not only did Woods fail to win for the first time in his 15 years on the PGA Tour, he wasn't even close. In nine of the 13 tournaments he finished, Woods was at least 10 shots behind going into the final round. He finished a career-low 68th on the money list. His biggest check was $330,000; a year earlier, he had averaged $618,127 per tournament. Was he trying? Yes. Consumed with it? Not so much. He parted with swing coach Hank Haney in May, tried to go it alone through a miserable summer, then hooked up with Sean Foley at the PGA Championship in August. 'My mind was not on that initially,' said Woods, who always said he only enters a tournament to win. 'I had a lot of things I had to deal with in order to get myself in the winner's circle. This summer was very difficult.' Contrary to tales that Woods travels with an entourage, he usually is on his own once a tournament gets under way. Any matter not related to golf, like business deals, must wait until he finishes. But when your wife is divorcing you, and two children are involved, some things simply can't wait. A phone call from a divorce lawyer. A proposal to approve. Asked how often that was the case this summer, Woods said, 'Every day. It was difficult.' The divorce became final on Aug. 23. In his first round as a single man, Woods shot 65 at The Barclays to share the lead. It was the only time all year his name was atop the leaderboard after any round. 'It's probably been a lot tougher on him than what people see, a lot harder than we all know,' Cink said. 'To have to own up to mistakes and basically be stripped down ... it's been hard for him.' Woods knew when he spoke to a worldwide audience on TV and to 40 of his closest friends and associates at Sawgrass that he was in for the toughest year of his life. 'I never would have thought I'd get divorced, but it became a reality,' he said. 'Never thought I'd change swing coaches, and that became a reality. I've certainly had a lot of change.' It might never be the same. Winning will be a big part in restoring some normalcy, but some changes will be permanent. 'I'm not going to have my family around,' he said. 'I'm not going to have the kids around at tournaments. So that's going to be different. You're still getting back into the routine of playing. Business as usual? It is, but it's not.' ------ So here he is, one year later. He lost three major endorsements in Accenture, AT&T and Gatorade that cost him more than $100 million. His golf bag, once the most coveted billboard of all, has carried only his name. Steinberg said they are starting to test the market, and more business deals are expected. What's his appeal? 'Arguably the greatest golfer that's every played,' Steinberg said. 'Exposure. Rehabilitation. Changed man. Redemption.' Woods took his first steps toward that last week when he wrote a guest column for Newsweek ('And even beyond accepting the consequences and responsibility, there is the ongoing struggle to learn from my failings,' it said). He was a guest on ESPN Radio with 'Mike & Mike in the Morning.' He began using Twitter. He remains stuck on 14 majors and 82 victories worldwide. A year ago, most conversations of Woods breaking Jack Nicklaus' record 18 majors was about WHEN it would happen. Now it's IF it ever will. 'It was always going to be tough,' Woods said, but then he went on to mention that Nicklaus achieved this over 20 years and 'I've got a career ahead of me still.' Woods wasn't one to reflect on his great years, whether it was nine wins and three straight majors in 2000, or the stretch of 12 tournaments in 2007-08 when he won eight times, never finishing worse than fifth and ending the streak by winning the U.S. Open on a broken leg. This is different. 'You have to look at the past in order to learn from it and move on,' he said. 'I've done a lot of reflecting over the past year. And certainly, I've turned the corner and am looking more toward the future in a lot of ways. I'm in a better place than I ever was. That's the beauty of it. That's what is fun and exciting about the future. 'I'm in a much more peaceful place than I've been in a very long time.' "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: It is one of the enduring puzzles surrounding the bailout of General Motors: Why did retired salaried personnel of a former GM division, Delphi, receive a fraction of their promised pension benefits, while Delphi's retired hourly personnel, members of the United Auto Workers, got 100 percent, paid for in part by the 'new' taxpayer-supported GM? For months, this has been a simmering cause celebre on the right, with critics accusing the Obama administration of paying off its union backers _ and echoing white-collar retirees' demand for the same deal the UAW got. Now, at the insistence of Republicans in Congress, Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for taxpayer bailout funds, has pledged to investigate 'whether political considerations played a role in favoring hourly over salaried retirees.' The story of GM's relationship with Delphi, which made powertrain, safety and other technologies, is a convoluted one. In short, GM spun off the company in 1999, and it later went bankrupt. As is usual in such situations, the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC) eventually took over Delphi's underfunded pension funds, paying its beneficiaries pennies on the dollar. But the UAW, unlike the salaried employees, had negotiated a prior agreement under which GM agreed to 'top off' members' pensions if an independent Delphi ever went bust. Honoring this commitment added $2.1 billion to the GM pension plan's deficit in the fall of 2008, a time when GM, too, was rapidly going down the tubes. The Obama administration's auto task force decided taxpayers couldn't afford to give Delphi's white-collar workers any more than the reduced benefits to which they were legally entitled. In contrast, the task force concluded that GM's commitment to the UAW was legally binding on a taxpayer-owned post-bankruptcy GM _ just as binding as its other pension obligations, which the task force had agreed to leave untouched. This is plausible, legally. But why did the administration make pension obligations to the UAW sacrosanct in the first place? We're talking a massive cost burden worth tens of billions of dollars. In theory, the PBGC could have taken it over, putting all UAW pensioners in the same position as Delphi's salaried retirees. To be sure, given the PBGC's precarious finances, this could have imposed a hit on taxpayers as well. But the administration might at least have pressed the UAW to reform its pensions, which are far more generous than those enjoyed by most work ers. Barofsky should read 'Overhaul,' the new book by auto task force member Steven Rattner. In Rattner's account, GM did suggest, quite reasonably, that the UAW accept a pension freeze and switch from defined benefits to an IRA-like plan. UAW officials refused even to discuss it _ and the auto task force went along with the union, because, as Rattner describes it, 'attacking the union's sacred cow ... could jeopardize the process.' 'Trying to break the UAW and crushing (GM and Chrysler's) creditors,' he writes, were 'steps that we believed unimaginable for the Obama administration.' Was this politics or crisis management? Rattner says the latter. It will be interesting to see whether Barofsky's review of the evidence leads to a different conclusion. "
1,"Philippe Mexes and Marco Borriello scored within two minutes of each other midway through the second half to help AS Roma overcome stiff resistance from Romanian side Cluj and earn a 2-1 win in the Champions League. Cluj stunned Roma 2-1 two years ago at the Stadio Olimpico in its Champions League debut and for long stretches Tuesday it looked like there might be a repeat. But Mexes found the target in the 69th and Borriello doubled the lead in the 71st before Ionut Rada pulled one back for Cluj in the 78th. Roma gained its first three points in Group E, while Cluj remained with three points after beating Basel in its opener. Mexes scored by redirecting a corner kick through traffic inside the area, while Borriello used one efficient touch to find the target following a long forward pass from Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi. Rada's goal came with a header after a free kick from the left flank. Cluj's Ivory Coast striker Lacina Traore hit the woodwork once in each half and Portuguese goalkeeper Nuno Claro made a series of difficult saves before the scoring began. For Roma, the win confirmed the squad's improving form only three days after a last-minute win over European champion Inter Milan, which snapped a streak of six disappointing performances to start the season. The Giallorossi squandered an early lead and lost the Italian Super Cup 3-1 to Inter, then opened Serie A with a 0-0 draw at home with newly promoted Cesena. After finishing with 10 men in a 5-1 loss to Cagliari, Roma then conceded two late goals in a 2-2 draw with Bologna and lost 2-1 at Brescia after again losing a man. In Europe, Roma opened with a 2-0 loss to last season's runner-up Bayern Munich. The outlook has changed now, though, and coach Claudio Ranieri's side has gained confidence. Roma next hosts Basel on Oct. 19, while Cluj visits Bayern. "
1,"When are the Obama daughters off limits to the public? The answer, apparently, is that it depends. On a few occasions when outside interests have tried to co-opt the popularity of Sasha and Malia _ such as when the Beanie Babies company sold dolls in their images, or when a group advocating nutrition-policy reform made reference to them on District of Columbia billboards _ the White House has swiftly clamped down. And early last year, in a statement, a spokeswoman for first lady Michelle Obama called it 'inappropriate to use young, private citizens for marketing purposes.' But what if the marketing campaign is President Barack Obama's new book? 'Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,' a 40-page picture book aimed at children ages 3 and older, is scheduled for release Nov. 16. The cover features an impressionistic painting of Malia, Sasha and first dog Bo. White House officials say the first daughters are marginal to the content. The book includes tributes to 13 'groundbreaking Americans and deals that have shaped our nation,' according to the book's publishers. Among the 13 are Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackie Robinson, George Washington and Albert Einstein. Using the girls to sell the title _ the second book in a $1.9 million deal for three books, only one of them for children, that Obama inked before becoming president _ is not inconsistent with the policy of generally shielding the girls from public attention, the officials say. 'I think our encouragement is to keep their private lives private,' press secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. Sasha, 9, and Malia, 12, will not be doing any book promotion, he said. In an interview with Sirius XM radio this week, Obama said he was asked to write the book by publishers who thought he 'might have something to say to young people.' The book was initially scheduled to come out in 2006 and explore a portion of Obama's childhood, according to a 2004 news release. The Obamas themselves have repeatedly put the daughters in the spotlight. The book title borrows from an earlier bit of exposure: a Parade magazine cover story that ran a few days before Obama's inauguration called 'A Letter to My Daughters,' featuring their picture. The first lady has included both girls in her anti-childhood obesity and healthy eating campaign, often saying in speeches that an uptick in her daughters' weight led her to serve more balanced meals. Obama, as a candidate, once told Parents magazine: 'A couple of years ago _ you'd never know it by looking at her now _ Malia was getting a little chubby.' Yet when the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine tried to do the same thing with a school lunch campaign aimed at reforming the Childhood Nutrition Act, a key priority for the first lady, they heard from the White House. The ad featured a young black girl with a thought bubble asking: 'President Obama's daughters get healthy lunches. Why don't I?' 'When we did the ad, it didn't mention their names, it didn't show their photographs and it was entirely positive,' said Neal Barnard, the group's president. 'I was very surprised to get a call from the White House lawyers saying that in no uncertain terms, I had to take the pictures down. I didn't.' Historian Doug Wead said that, as they continue to put their daughters in the spotlight, the Obamas could find it harder to argue that they should not be written about. Wead said that 'as they get older and more famous they become more of a commodity.' 'You can't say they are off limits and then spoon-feed stories of your own choosing,' said Wead, author of 'All the President's Children.' Still, it is difficult for any presidential parent to fully separate the political from the personal, according to Letitia Baldrige, who served as social secretary in the Kennedy administration. 'I think every president has been aware of the power of children. The Kennedys didn't want the kids talked about at all, they clamped down on everything, but 14 months into the administration, if the children had a story, it came out,' Baldrige said. 'The children were used as a public relations tool and all of a sudden it made the Kennedys very cozy and family-like. It was a whole new way of looking at them.' "
1,"WASHINGTON - C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general who gave the country its first frank talk about AIDS almost 25 years ago, warned Wednesday that the disease is becoming 'the forgotten epidemic.' About 56,000 Americans become infected each year, about 15,000 die and about one-fifth of those with the virus don't know they have it, he told a gathering at the National Press Club. HIV - the virus that causes AIDS - continues to be transmitted readily in the gay community, and efforts to prevent infections or diagnose them early have not made much progress. 'Simply put, HIV is no longer on the public's radar screen, and the result is deadly serious,' Koop said. Although ignorance about AIDS remains widespread, the 'irrational fear' that accompanied its emergence in the early 1980s has now been replaced by 'a growing sense of complacency that is as dangerous,' he added. Koop, who is 95 and lives in New Hampshire, is in Washington to attend the National Summit on HIV Diagnosis, Prevention and Access to Care. He will give an address on Friday about his experiences in the early days of the AIDS epidemic and will receive an award. At the news conference, Koop spoke from a wheelchair, his head bent forward close to his text. He told the gathering that he is 'very, very deaf' and in the past few months had become legally blind. 'I suspect this is probably the last time I'll be speaking in the National Press Club,' he said. Appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 - the year AIDS was first described - Koop was an unexpected vehicle for AIDS education and advice on safe-sex practices. He was a pediatric surgeon, not a public health physician. He was a practicing Christian who wrote theological tracts. Unlike recent holders of the office, he always wore his surgeon general's dress uniform, which with his mustacheless beard made him look like an admiral from the Civil War. Koop became famous for frank, practical and nonjudgmental talk about AIDS. In 1986, he issued a report to the American people about the disease, with 20 million copies distributed to local governments, schools and physicians. In 1988, an eight-page version was mailed to 107 million households, which he recalled being told was the largest mass mailing in U.S. history. In the early years of the epidemic 'the country was rife with rumors and misinformation' that HIV could be contracted through casual contact at schools, restaurants and in bathrooms, he said. There was also 'a pervasive bias against the people most affected by HIV/AIDS, which severely hampered our ability to respond,' he added. In his public pronouncements, he said he focused on two messages: that the risk of infection increases with the number of sexual partners and that the best protection besides abstinence is the use of condoms. The unchecked expansion of the epidemic slowed as that message sank in. 'What was the lesson here?' Koop asked. 'If you tell people the truth, in a very factual way, they will act. When it comes to bad news or controversial issues, Americans want to hear it straight.' While HIV infection remains concentrated in the gay community - 53 percent of new cases are in gay and bisexual men - almost half of the people who are infected are black, which is far different from the white, middle-class first face of the epidemic. Gay men in the 1980s altered their behavior, but a generation later 'a whole new cohort moved from adolescence into adulthood totally untaught,' Koop said. Prevention efforts should be aimed at gays, bisexuals and intravenous drug users, as in the early years, and also at African Americans, who account for half of the people with HIV, and Hispanics, a population group with rising rates of infection. Koop appeared with three AIDS scientists and public health physicians, who previewed what they would say at the HIV summit, being held at National Harbor in Maryland. He was asked to give the final message at the news conference. 'I occasionally get birthday cards that say, 'Never, never, never, never give up,' ' he said. 'That's my message.' "
1,"Since the uncomfortably close attempted attack on Northwest Flight 253 last week, many have focused on why the alleged terrorist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was not placed on a watch list that would have prevented him from flying, even though the government had received information that he was a potential extremist. We should focus on a more fundamental question: How can we keep explosive materials off planes? Most airport security checkpoints use metal detectors. Al-Qaida has shown that it knows how to avoid detection by using an explosive device that contains little or no metal, such as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, used by Abdulmutallab and 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid in 2001. During my time as secretary of homeland security, the Transportation Security Administration began working to replace the 1970s-era metal detectors used at airports across America with modern technology able to detect non-metal weapons concealed by terrorists on their bodies _ even in their underwear, where Abdulmutallab allegedly hid his bomb. The latest versions of these machines _ sometimes called whole-body imagers _ are deployed at 19 airports, and the TSA is attempting to place them throughout the nation. From the onset, deployment of the machines has been vigorously opposed by some groups. In June, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would prevent the TSA from using the new systems in most cases. If the House bill were to become law, the TSA would be limited to using the new technology only after a passenger had been selected for additional scrutiny. The vast majority of passengers would still pass only through metal detectors. So, under the standards set by the House bill, a terrorist not on a 'no-fly' list or a watch list mandating closer scrutiny _ like Abdulmutallab _ could probably carry a concealed non-metal weapon onto a plane undetected. Congress should reject this restrictive bill and instead fund a large-scale deployment of next-generation systems. Opposition to whole-body imagers essentially relies on three arguments. First, the American Civil Liberties Union and privacy advocates have complained that the machines subject passengers to a 'virtual strip search.' Second, they claim that the machines are unsafe because they expose passengers to dangerous amounts of radiation in screening. Third, some critics argue that the only correct approach to airline security lies in better intelligence. All of these objections lack merit. The 'safety' concern is particularly specious, because the technologies expose people to no more radiation than is experienced in daily life. The case of Abdulmutallab shows that we cannot simply 'rely on intelligence.' Abdulmutallab was not on a watch list that required closer scrutiny. Even if the review President Obama has ordered closes a gap that would have put Abdulmutallab or others on more select watch lists, there are plenty of terrorists out there about whom we know nothing. Too many potentially dangerous people simply would not appear on any watch list. We cannot put all our eggs in the 'intelligence basket.' That's why, since Sept. 11, 2001, we have worked to establish multiple layers of defense to protect the American people. Watch lists surely are an important layer, as is intelligence-sharing, but others, such as the deployment of advanced detection technology, are just as important. Claims that the screening amounts to 'virtual strip searches' is calculated to alarm the public. As if screening is meant to reveal people's private parts to TSA officers. But the agency has nonetheless taken privacy concerns seriously in creating procedures for using this technology. In deploying the machines, the TSA has strictly limited the number of officers who see the images; separates the officers looking at images from the passengers being screened (so the officers do not know which passengers the images belong to); and uses software to blur the faces on the images _ further protecting the anonymity of passengers. Moreover, the machines are configured to prevent TSA officers from storing or retaining any images. As an additional measure, passengers can choose not to walk through one of the machines and receive a physical examination instead. In short, the TSA has listened to the reasonable concerns of privacy advocates and incorporated numerous suggestions into its protocols to draw the right balance between security and privacy. The administration must stand firm against privacy ideologues, for whom every security measure is unacceptable. Failing to use all available tools to plug a gap in security puts the lives of airline travelers needlessly at risk. The writer was secretary of homeland security from 2005 to 2009 and is co- founder of the Chertoff Group, a security and risk-management firm whose clients include a manufacturer of body-imaging screening machines.

1,"A short time after his first game at the Emirates Stadium since his return to Arsenal, 35-year-old Sol Campbell was asked about the prospect of playing twice a week to fill in for the injured William Gallas. 'If that's required, I'll have to do something about it and keep on playing really,' Campbell said after the Gunners beat FC Porto 5-0 and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Campbell has made five appearances since signing for Arsenal, and the defender even scored an away goal against Porto last month. With Gallas, Arsenal's regular central defender, still troubled by a lingering calf injury, Campbell may be called on by manager Arsene Wenger to play a bigger role in the club's quest for both the Premier League and Champions League titles. 'I'm levelheaded. I'm not going to get carried away or anything. It's great to be back and in this type of environment,' said Campbell, who rejoined Arsenal after a brief stint at League Two club Notts County. 'I relish the moments. I respect the situation I'm in and I'm going to give everything I've got every time I play for Arsenal.' On Tuesday, Campbell received a rapturous reception from the fans at the Emirates. 'It was great. It's a fantastic stadium. It's just good to be out there with the lads,' Campbell said. 'It's nice to be recognized and be loved by the fans.' Wenger has a policy of not bringing back players he has released. But he made an exception for Campbell because the defender was a free agent and Wenger felt he needed more experience at the back. And Campbell brings plenty of experience, last playing for the Gunners in the 2006 Champions League final loss to Barcelona. 'You have to take every game as it comes. But every time you play, you put a good shift in and go from there,' Campbell said. 'Every game is like a cup final now for us, from now until the end of the season.' "
1,"In the oil business, geologists tell stories. Here was a river, they will say. Here was a shallow sea. Here is where the sea dried up and left only salt. Here is where the sea formed anew, and widened, and deepened, and where sediments from another river, and the carcasses of microorganisms, were deposited, buried, baked, until finally _ the enchanting payoff of the story if you're an eager- beaver oil executive _ the organic matter turned into oil. The Gulf of Mexico is full of such stories. Unfortunately, the story of one well, named Macondo, drilled by the rig Deepwater Horizon, has turned into a tragedy. The geology of the gulf is pretty close to perfect for the creation of oil reservoirs. There are salt sheets and domes that form impermeable caps on oil fields. There are abundant rock formations that have been deformed into hump- shaped strata known as anticlines, natural traps for oil. 'It traps oil and gas beautifully,' said Roger Anderson, a Columbia University geophysicist who has long studied Gulf of Mexico geology. Anderson compares the deep-water gulf to Texas and Oklahoma more than a century ago. The 'oil patch' had its famous moments, such as the Spindletop gusher in Beaumont, Texas, in 1901, which blew out at 100,000 barrels (4.2 million gallons) per day, and the Wild Mary well, which spewed out of control for 11 days in Oklahoma City in 1930. That region still produces, but there aren't many big discoveries still to be made in the pincushioned ground. Not so the deep water. There's oil out there, in reservoirs that can top a billion barrels. 'It's like the old days. It's true frontier,' Anderson says. It's not the only such place in the world. There's abundant oil in deep water off the coasts of Brazil and West Africa, for example. But the gulf has its own near-unique geology, shaped by the great river that flows into it. The Mighty Mississippi, the Father of Waters, drains almost everything from the Rockies to the Appalachians. Millions of years ago, the Red River, which forms part of the Texas/Oklahoma border, was as big as the Mississippi. These rivers dumped dead organisms into the gulf in prodigious quantities. Those nutrients help feed thriving ecosystems and some of the richest fisheries in the world. But the gulf is also an isolated sea, almost walled off from the Atlantic Ocean by Cuba and the Florida and Yucatan peninsulas. That means the gulf lacks the deep-water circulation of open ocean. Bad circulation means lots of anoxic layers, dead zones, places where there's so little oxygen that organic matter doesn't decay. That's great for the eventual creation of an oil field. 'What oil and gas is is undecayed dead organisms. Microorganisms, not dinosaurs. So the small foraminifera and algae that lived in the ocean and lived in the Mississippi River died and got swept out to sea and got buried under all the mud coming out of the Mississippi. As it got deeper and deeper, it got hotter and hotter and got cooked into oil,' Anderson said. Ken Deffeyes, a retired Princeton geologist who once worked for Shell Oil and has written about the gulf, said, 'The Mississippi Delta and the Niger Delta are the only two really productive, big deltas in the world. The Amazon, nothing. The Ganges, nothing or very, very little.' The geology story has been unfolding for more than 40 million years, to the very origin of the gulf as a rift in the crust of the Earth. The gulf is widening to this day. Cuba is sliding away from Texas. The Yucatan peninsula is retreating from Louisiana. At its deepest point, the Gulf of Mexico is more than 12,000 feet deep. The oil-hunters know the sub-sea escarpments and canyons the same way hikers know mountains and rivers. They have explored the Sigsbee Escarpment, the long cliff at the edge of the abyssal plain; they've poked holes in the Mississippi Fold Belt and the Perdido Fan Fold Belt. There is one tricky consequence of the fact that the Mississippi River deposits so much sediment in the gulf. The rapid layering of mud in deep, low-oxygen water leads to high rates of gas formation. The gas is valuable, potentially. It's also the major cause of the loss of well control _ blowouts. Gas was the lethal agent in the Deepwater Horizon explosion. So for the petroleum executives (if not for the shrimp and fish and turtles and so on), the gulf is a good place to drill holes in the sea floor. But it's also a place that demands great care. That's true even in the shallows. But the drilling rigs have marched _ or sailed, to be more precise _ right off the continental shelf, into very deep water, using satellite technology and precision thrusters to fix themselves over wells drilled on the continental slope and in the depths beyond. The oil industry looks at the gulf covetously, for this is where roughly a third of the U.S. domestic oil production comes from, increasingly from the deep water. The oil companies do not drill randomly. Where the oil is, and in what quantity, are the questions that preoccupy oil companies that need huge amounts of capital to drill a deep-water well. 'That well is going to cost you 40 to 50 million dollars to drill, and you can't afford to drill a lot of dry ones,' said Dennis O'Neill, a computer scientist who has worked for decades in petroleum exploration. So the companies use sound and radar to take snapshots of what's hidden below the sea floor. A large vessel will tow anywhere from eight to 20 cables, each thousands of feet long and studded with hydrophones, which are microphones that float in the water. The vessel will fire an air gun that creates a sound that propagates through the water and down through the sea floor into the rock below. The microphones pick up echoes; software creates a picture that helps the geologists craft a story of what's below the sea floor: the type of rock, the faulting, the salt layers, the potential traps for oil. 'In a perfect geophysical world, when you listen to the echoes of the sound propagating and bouncing back through this rock, and plot it on a piece of paper, you'll see what looks like a layer cake of the geological structures,' O'Neill said. If the picture that emerges matches a plausible 'story' of oil, the company can decide whether to drill the site. 'The only way to test the hypothesis is to drill a well,' O'Neill said. The long-term question, one that has incited great debate, is how much oil is still out there, yet to be discovered and potentially commercial. Deffeyes, a leading proponent of the idea that the world needs to be concerned with an inexorably downward turn in oil production known as 'Peak Oil,' said it's time to prepare for the post-oil age. Indeed, he says, we need to move beyond all of the nonrenewable energy resources. The professor says, 'We have about 100 years of coal plus uranium plus natural gas plus oil. But you've got to start switching to natural gas now. You've got to start building more nuclear power plants. But your goal in 100 years: You've got to be 100 percent solar _ that's wind, plants, biodiesel _ all those things are directly or indirectly solar.' When will Peak Oil happen? 'It happened in 2005,' Deffeyes said. "
1,"The Commonwealth Games were supposed to be India's grand coming-out party, an audition for a potential Olympic bid and a chance to show off its rising status as a superpower and serious rival to China. But for all of India's high hopes, the games have become a source of national shame. Allegations of fraud, construction delays, budget overruns and security concerns have plagued the games for months. Then a series of incidents this week - including a bridge collapse and descriptions of the athletes' living quarters as filthy - added to India's troubles. Even the theme song for the games was deemed disappointing. Instead of looking scrubbed and polished, roads in the capital are still dug up, piles of rubble hiding unfinished work in what has become a symbol of the gaps between India's aspirations and the realities on the ground. More than 7,000 athletes from 71 nations of the former British Empire are supposed to arrive here by Friday for the Oct. 3-14 games. But some have announced plans to withdraw, and New Zealand and Canada joined Scotland on Thursday in taking a wait-and-see approach. 'The games are officially a disaster. The people of India feel dejected. Instead of boosting our profile, we are now objects of pity around the world,' said Boria Majumdar, a sports historian who has written a national bestseller about the games. 'We have lost our chance at an Olympic bid for 2020. Who will trust India now?' The centerpiece of a jaw-dropping opening ceremony - a $12 million helium balloon -is being hastily rejiggered because of an equipment malfunction, an official said. A smaller inner balloon, fitted with cameras to project images of 5,000 years of Indian culture and India's economic rise, burst in torrential rains and lightning. 'Now it is just a big expensive balloon,' sighed the official. Adding to India's headache, this year's monsoon rains have been the worst in decades. An outbreak of dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, has killed five people and sickened 2,500 in the capital. India's health minister, Gulam Nabi Azad, said pools of dirty water around construction sites 'have become a breeding place for mosquitoes.' Delhi state government's health minister announced in August that the army would be called in to remove stagnate water from the athletes' village. But the government, worried that the army's presence would create panic, decided against the plan. On Wednesday, the government reversed that decision, saying the army and the air force were desperately needed to pump water out of the village, which the chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation called 'unfit for human habitation.' The monsoon has lasted longer than expected, bringing into question India's selection of October for the event in the first place. 'Elections, marriages and sporting events - we all know in India that these are best held in the month of November,' after the rains, said M.S. Gill, India's sports minister. Officials are praying for a night without rain so they can finish work. Workers at the main stadium received letters on Tuesday saying they would have to work seven days a week for more than 11 hours a day, a violation of the games' labor laws. 'The only legacy of the games would be the realization that we are not a modern nation,' said a high-ranking consultant to the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his comments would jeopardize his job. A portion of the ceiling at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main venue for the games, collapsed Wednesday, a day after a footbridge near the stadium crashed down, injuring 27 construction workers, six critically. The same day, several star athletes - including England's world champion triple jumper Phillips Idowu - pulled out of the games after hearing about the conditions at the athletes' village. Security concerns were heightened Sunday when gunmen fired on a tourist bus at the city's historic mosque, injuring two visitors. The gunmen remain at large. 'It's enough to have to worry about performing, but to worry where you sleep and walk is another thing,' said Dani Samuels, an Australian discus world champion who withdrew this week. In an effort to save the games, Mike Fennell, the federation's president, arrived Thursday for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose office took over the city's preparations last month. Oscar winner A.R. Rahman, a national hero for his 'Slumdog Millionaire' hit song 'Jai Ho,' was paid $1 million to compose the game's theme song. But critics said it lacked the energy of Shakira's 'Waka Waka,' the World Cup anthem. 'A double whammy of embarrassment and humiliation,' the Indian Express newspaper wrote. 'Games India's Shame,' read a front-page headline in the Times of India. Defenders of India's effort say the setbacks are the normal growing pains for a rising nation that will soon surprise the world and show it can pull the games off. They point to several major projects that were completed on time. A new international airport terminal has received rave reviews along with a clean and speedy subway. 'What the Olympic Games did for Beijing, the Commonwealth Games will do for Delhi. It will become a world-class city,' said Suresh Kalmadi, president of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee. 'India is the flavor of the season. We want to show that Delhi can be a great sporting hub.' Many Indians have complained about the cost of hosting the games, with estimates ranging from $3 billion to more than $10 billion. In 2003, India said it would spend less than $100 million. There have also been countless charges of corruption and bribes, which the prime minister's office said it is investigating. After weeks of uproar on the streets and in Parliament, the government admitted last month that more than $130 million allocated for poverty reduction programs had been diverted to projects related to the games. 'Financially, the games are a major fiasco,' said Norris Pritam, an Indian sports journalist who has covered the Olympics and Asian Games. 'It has damaged India's reputation, especially abroad. My main worry is that the world will be afraid to put their money in India.' During an official tour of the flagship stadium last week, Kalmadi proclaimed the venue '100 percent ready,' even as workers banged and metal clanged near him. 'This is just last-minute polishing and a little bit of cleaning going on' to keep the workers occupied, he said over the noise. 'Otherwise, what will they do?' "
1,"Ballet as blood sport hardly begins to describe the audacious 'Black Swan,' director Darren Aronofsky's fever dream of paranoia, artistry and toe shoes. Don't be fooled by the rarefied milieu: 'Black Swan' is one of the best, lushest horror films since 'The Shining,' worthy of every inevitable comparison to the high-minded creep-outs of Cronenberg, Polanski and Lynch. As a prima ballerina coming unglued from forces either ghostly or psychotic, Natalie Portman justifies years of barely earned praise. She's as convincing in derangement as she is en pointe. Portman plays Nina, a New York City ballet dancer poised to become a superstar after being cast in a new version of 'Swan Lake.' Under the guidance of the company's Balanchine-like taskmaster (portrayed without a false note by Vincent Cassel), the technically proficient Nina is well-suited for the virginal White Swan, but she'll have to dig deep into something dark to bring out her inner Black Swan. Nina finds no respite from stress off stage. Her domineering, embittered mother (Barbara Hershey, her tight face perfect for the sickest mom since 'Carrie') barely tries to mask the cruelty beneath her attentiveness. A seemingly friendly understudy (Mila Kunis, in an actress-is-born performance) clearly has sinister motives. Whatever real-world knives are pointed at Nina's back are nothing compared to the spectral dangers lurking about. Portraits' eyes move, reflections have lives of their own, bloody scratches appear on Nina's shoulder and disgusting little black threads erupt from her skin. Someone or something is out to get her. Aronofsky ('The Wrestler'), with a screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin, doesn't shy away from bump-in-the-night frights or creaky Freudian hokum. Bodily transformation, and the repulsion that goes with it, has been the stuff of horror films from Lon Chaney through 'The Exorcist.' Here, Aronofsky uses it to illuminate the physical self-destruction done in the quest for artistic perfection. He and cinematographer Matthew Libatique turn the elaborate preparation and donning of ballet slippers into an act of determined masochism, closer to Chinese foot-binding than costume. A small imperfection of the finger, no larger than a hangnail, is ripped from flesh like loose thread from a sweater. 'Black Swan' is as gross as it is frightening, and the art-house pretensions don't always keep up with the funhouse excesses. So what? Leaving the theater, I heard the phrase 'over the top' in two separate conversations. A fair assessment of any decent nightmare. _ _ _ 'Black Swan,' from Fox Searchlight Pictures, opens Friday in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and San Francisco.

1,"Unemployment in Britain for the three months ending in September held steady at 7.7 percent, unchanged from the level reported a month earlier. The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 3,700 to 1.47 million. The number of people with jobs rose to 29.2 million, 286,000 higher than a year earlier. The number of people working part-time because they could not find full-time employment rose by 67,000 in the three months to a record high of 1.15 million. "
1,"The next time you grab a sheet of paper to do your homework, remember that the product you're writing on was once a tree. Most kids know this, but what you may not know is how a tree is turned into paper. Trees are made of cellulose fibers, organic compounds and a natural glue-like substance called lignin that holds everything together. Cellulose makes up about half of a tree and is used to make paper. But first you need to separate cellulose from other wood parts. Paper mills get their wood from two sources: small trees that are harvested for paper and scraps from larger trees that were sent to sawmills for lumber. The bark is stripped off, and trees are put through a chipper, which makes it easier to process. Once the wood has been chipped, it's converted to wood pulp. Pulping requires a combination of steam, pressure, chemicals, grinders and in some cases, bleach. Unbleached pulp becomes bags and boxes. Bleached pulp is turned into paper for writing or printing. (Bleached wood pulp is gooey and white _ like mashed potatoes, without the yummy taste.) When the pulp is finished, it's mixed with water and sprayed onto large, moving screens. The water drains through the screens, and that lets the cellulose fibers stick together to make paper. The paper moves at high speeds through a series of presses and driers. Additives strengthen the paper. Finally, the finished paper is wound on rolls and cut to size. Now that you know the basics of making paper, I have a question for you. True or false? You can buy paper that's made from elephant poop. True. Depending on the season, an elephant's diet consists of grass, leaves, twigs, bark, vines, roots, flowers and even fruit. However, since vegetation can be difficult to digest, lots of plant fiber comes out of the elephant's body without being broken down. By cleaning and removing the waste from undigested plant matter, you can harvest enough cellulose to make paper. Thanks to the enterprising minds of eco-friendly folks, you can buy paper made from the poop of pandas, kangaroos, sheep, bison and reindeer. Do you think any of your friends might like some as a birthday present? - - - Bennett is a Washington pediatrician and author of health-related books for kids. "
1,"NEW YORK - Stocks advanced Tuesday, erasing most of Monday's drop, as Walgreen Co. led a rally in consumer- staples and health companies and investors speculated the Federal Reserve will buy more debt to safeguard the economy. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 0.5 percent to 1,147.70 after tumbling as much as 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 46.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,858.14. 'Investors are getting more comfortable with taking some risk as it sounds like the Fed's goal is to increase inflation,' said Eric Green, director of research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. 'If the economy doesn't get better, there seems to be a belief the Fed is going to stimulate through purchases. If it does get better, that's good for stocks also.' The S&P 500 has rallied about 9 percent since the end of August, poised for its best month since April 2009 and its biggest September rally since 1939, as concern eased that Europe's debt crisis and U.S. unemployment will derail the economic rebound. Stocks and Treasury bonds also have gained on speculation the Fed will buy more U.S. government debt to keep interest rates low in a practice known as quantitative easing. The Fed announced after its Sept. 21 meeting that it's prepared to do more to help the economy, spurring speculation policy makers will add Treasury securities to the central bank's holdings. The central bank Tuesday purchased $550 million of Treasury Inflation Protected securities as part of a program to reinvest principal payments on its mortgage holdings into long- term government debt. A bigger-than-estimated decrease in consumer confidence helped fuel speculation of another round of quantitative easing. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 48.5, lower than forecast, from 53.2 the prior month. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decline to 52.1. Walgreen surged 11 percent to $33.81. The company's fourth-quarter earnings were 53 cents a share excluding items such as costs related to the Duane Reade acquisition, beating the 44-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Rival CVS Caremark climbed 2.7 percent to $31.45. Pfizer advanced 1.5 percent to $17.43. Johnson & Johnson rose 0.6 percent to $62.43. All but five of the 51 health-care stocks in the S&P 500 advanced, sending the group to the biggest advance among 10 industries. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by drug makers seeking to block hospitals and clinics from suing for violations of a federal program that lets them buy medicines at a discount. The court granted review to an appeal by companies including units of Pfizer, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis. The drug makers are challenging a lower court ruling permitting a suit filed by the California county of Santa Clara. Endo Pharmaceuticals rallied 8.1 percent to $33.10 after rising to $34.26 earlier, the highest intraday price since August 2007. The drugmaker agreed to buy Qualitest Pharmaceuticals, a closely held U.S. generic-drug maker, for about $1.2 billion in cash from private-equity firm Apax Partners. Broadwind Energy surged 27 percent to $1.87 on speculation General Electric will acquire the maker of wind towers, according to Raymond James & Associates equity analyst Pavel Molchanov. General Electric, the world's second-biggest maker of wind turbines, said Monday it formed a joint venture with China's Harbin Power Equipment to make and supply equipment in the world's biggest market. Amedisys dropped 16 percent to $24.02 for the biggest retreat in the Russell 2000 Index. The largest U.S. home-nursing provider was asked by federal prosecutors for information related to Medicare reimbursements and billing claims by its 31 Alabama home-health operations. Monsanto fell 8.1 percent to $48.75, bringing its two-day drop to 12 percent, the most since 2008. Initial field data on Monsanto's SmartStax genetically modified corn showed weaker-than-expected performance, Jefferies Group said in a note. Separately, Australia's Nufarm reported 2010 North American sales of glyphosate, a herbicide also sold by Monsanto, fell 44 percent year over year. With assistance from Rita Nazareth in New York. "
1,"Now we know why there were no Margaret Thatcher tea cups in 1979. The Iron Lady wouldn't have it. When her media adviser, Gordon Reece, said he had been inundated with requests to lend her image to such souvenirs, she swiftly knocked it down: 'No (underlined) permission to be given at all on any grounds of any kind.' Newly released files from the first year of Thatcher's 11-year run as British prime minister show her to be as decisive on the big issues as she was on the trivial ones that tied lesser figures into indecisive knots. Thatcher, for all her reputation as a hard-liner, rebuffed appeals from U.S. President Jimmy Carter for a more demonstrative response to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, saying it would do more harm than good, according to papers in her personal files released Saturday. The files cover the first eight months of Thatcher's 11 1/2 years as prime minister, giving glimpses of her embarking on an ambitious domestic agenda to revive the economy and curb the unions, and engaging with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4. They were made public by the Thatcher Foundation under rules that allow for keeping documents secret for 30 years. On Nov. 14, 1979, Carter asked in a cable for 'the strongest possible remonstration or action' to pressure Iran, suggesting that Britain consider reducing the number of diplomatic staff in the country. Thatcher responded a week later that Britain had withdrawn some staff, 'but we have not hitherto believed it wise to make a political point of any reduction, partly because we doubt whether the Iranians would be much impressed and partly because of the risk of retaliatory action against those remaining.' In May, before the embassy seizure and less than two weeks after Thatcher was elected, Carter had appealed for 'urgent private representations' to Iranian authorities to assure the safety of Iranian Jews. Thatcher refused, saying the British Embassy did not believe Jews faced organized persecution, and that intervention 'could indeed make their position less secure.' Thatcher had met Carter twice in 1977, before she was elected, and the U.S. president came away displeased, though according to previously released papers, he mellowed by the time Thatcher became prime minister, agreeing with National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski's view that she was 'a cooler, wiser, more pragmatic person now than the opposition leader you met in May 1977 or the dogmatic lady who visited you in Washington that fall.' The newly released files -- 23,198 pages from Thatcher's personal and political files -- show touches of 'the Iron Lady' even before she became Britain's first female prime minister in 1979. In 1977, in a reply to a consultant, she wrote: 'I have already come to the conclusion that I shall have to take most of the major decisions myself.' Many of the papers go online Saturday at the Thatcher Foundation Web site, http://www.margaretthatcher.org, and many of them duplicate official government documents in the National Archives. Chris Collins, editor of the Web site, hopes that all 1 million pages, both from the National Archives and her personal files, could be digitized and many of them put online. In her first days in power, Thatcher's office was swamped with congratulatory letters and telegrams from well-wishers including the late romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, singer Petula Clark, American economist Milton Friedman and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A slightly garbled telegram from an excited British Davis Cup tennis team said: 'BALL NOW IN YOUR COURT TO SERVE CONNOWBALLS TO UNIONS.' That's what Thatcher's supporters expected of her: to tame the trade unions which they blamed for Britain's economic malaise of the 1970s. The files include a squeak of complaint from her husband, Denis Thatcher. 'Another dreaded State Banquet I am afraid,' the diary secretary wrote to him. He responded that he had planned on dinner with fellow rugby fans, but would skip it for the banquet. 'What I do for the Party!' He wrote. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: Ravaged by war and genocide, ruled by a dictator who has been indicted for war crimes, Sudan is a prime candidate to become a crisis for the Obama administration. But there is also a small chance for peace and groundbreaking change in the next year. A hint of that came on Tuesday, when President Omar Hassan al-Bashir signed a truce with the biggest rebel group from the region of Darfur. A full peace accord remains to be worked out, and previous truces have fallen through. But this deal _ brokered by a U.N. and African Union team, with help from the government of Qatar _ looks somewhat more promising, and it comes at an auspicious moment. The war in Darfur, which is estimated to have caused more than 300,000 deaths and prompted a global campaign to defend its 2 million refugees, may have ended. The head of the international peacekeeping force declared it over last summer. There has been little fighting in recent months, though most of the refugees remain in their camps. Mr. Bashir, who has been dodging an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for nearly a year, may be ready to make peace. He agreed this month on a separate truce with the president of Chad, which has helped to sponsor rebels in Darfur and has been plagued by Sudanese-backed insurgents in return. Mr. Bashir's peacemaking is partly driven by his desire to free himself from the war crimes charges and sanctions against his government. But he also has two major political hurdles ahead of him. One is a national election scheduled for April 11, the first in 26 years, in which he is running for president against 11 other candidates. That vote, in turn, will set the stage for a referendum in January in which southern Sudan will decide whether to become an independent country. Most likely it will do so _ which means its government and that of Khartoum would be faced with trying to negotiate the terms of separation. The potential for violence in all this is enormous. Fighting along tribal lines is growing in the south, along with accusations that the fighting is being fueled by Mr. Bashir's government. If war returns to the south, where 2 million people were killed before a 2005 peace accord, the fighting in Darfur could quickly resume as well. Though the Khartoum regime would like to prevent southern independence, it would be hard to do so by force _ especially since the southern army now deploys tanks and other heavy weapons. So Mr. Bashir has an incentive to negotiate with representatives of Darfur and southern Sudan _ and the Obama administration, in turn, has reason to encourage him. The nuanced policy for Sudan that Mr. Obama adopted in October, a mix of incentives and possible punishments, provides some latitude; the administration's special envoy, Scott Gration, was in Doha, Qatar, when Tuesday's truce was signed. While it's hard to imagine that the restoration of normal relations between the United States and a government headed by Mr. Bashir could ever be justified, stranger things have happened: Ask Libya's Moammar Gaddafi. For now it makes sense for the administration to encourage completion of the Darfur peace talks and peaceful staging of the April elections. Preventing another explosion of violence will count as a success. "
1,"He is wearing an orange prison jumpsuit during the TV interview, so you figure life hasn't turned out so well for this open-faced young man with an engaging smile. What you can't see is the Purple Heart Jose Barco earned when, as a teenage soldier stationed in Iraq, he ignored his own wounds and pulled burning wreckage off two Army buddies pinned beneath it, even as his own clothes were aflame. These days Barco lives in a Colorado prison, where he's serving a 52-year sentence for twice shooting randomly at party-goers in Fort Collins, Colo., after his second tour of Iraq. No one was seriously injured, although a pregnant woman was shot in the leg. Barco was convicted of two counts of attempted murder. Troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have been getting short shrift on several fronts. But, as Barco's case shows, the legal system usually cuts them no slack and sometimes slams them extra hard precisely because they wore a U.S. uniform. Prison is where 'Frontline' interviewed him for the documentary, 'The Wounded Platoon,' which aired last month on Public Broadcasting Service stations. He is one of 17 men returning to the Army's Fort Carson, Colo., who, over a five- year period, were convicted or charged with homicide or attempting it. Most of them seemed to suffer from a condition that has plagued combat veterans as far back as anyone noticed. Called 'soldier's heart' when Civil War veterans experienced it, then 'shell shock' and 'battle fatigue' in later wars, the ailment now is recognized as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which can afflict survivors of other horrific, life- threatening events. Depression, anger, insomnia, nightmares, flashbacks, paranoia are among its symptoms. Its sufferers often fall into alcoholism and drug addiction, some beat or shoot their wives or girlfriends. The more intense the combat, the more likely the soldier is to suffer from the disorder. As many as 15 percent of combat troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experience it, according to a Rand Corp. study and a Department of Veterans' Affairs report. When the United States needed more troops in Iraq, tours were extended, stateside breaks between deployments were shortened, and soldiers already battle-scarred were sent into some of the bloodiest, most unrelentingly scary work of the war. So it was predictable that the need for mental-health services would spike when these troops started returning from the surge, announced in 2007. But when it came to staffing up with psychologists and psychiatrists, the military somehow never got enough boots on the ground. Nor had the Pentagon found a way to break the stigma a soldier faces when he admits a need for help, or to stop their superiors from ridiculing them when they do. It might have helped to remind them all that heroes suffer PTSD, too. Infantryman Audie Murphy, the most decorated serviceman in World War II, suffered from insomnia, violent nightmares, depression and drug addiction, according to biographers. In the 1960s, Murphy broke his silence in hopes that Korean War and Vietnam War veterans might get more help. He urged the federal government to do more research into the emotional and mental-health consequences of combat. Murphy, said to have killed or captured some 240 Germans, didn't go out and shoot up a party of strangers. He did face an attempted murder charge for beating up a dog trainer, although he was acquitted. And, like some of Barco's platoon mates, Murphy kept a loaded gun by his bedside when he slept. His first wife has said he once held her at gun point. Barco had domestic problems, too. Before his arrest for the shootings at the party, he had kicked in the door of his wife's home and, finding her gone, fired into her bed pillow, says District Attorney Dan May. He pleaded guilty to felony menacing. Barco's unit saw more combat in Iraq more intensely for more tours of duty which lasted longer than most. And while plenty platoon mates returned to normal, productive lives, others didn't land well. Recognizing the problem, Fort Carson has more than doubled its behavioral health specialists on staff since 2008 and instituted a number of programs aimed at better screening, identifying troubled soldiers and giving them the help they need. As for those done with active service, of the 508,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who have gotten medical help from the VA, almost 130,000 are being treated for PTSD, according to the VA. Federal and state governments have collaborated on veterans courts that now dot the country. Aimed at getting troubled veterans into treatment rather than prison, the courts typically handle drug and other mostly non-violent offenses. One such court opened last year in Colorado Springs, near Fort Collins. Barco, diagnosed with PTSD and a concussive injury from his time at war, seems to have paid an extra price for his service. The judge slapped another 20 years onto the mandatory minimum sentence of 32 years, saying he 'brings considerable discredit to the uniform.' The discredit to the uniform is that the country for which these men and women risked their lives did so poorly in quelling the war still raging within them.

1,"Champion Olympiakos travels to AEK Athens as the new season kicks off this weekend with its rivals desperate to break the Piraeus club's dominance after its fifth straight title and 12th in 13 years. Olympiakos already looks set for a place in the Champions League's group stage after an easy 2-0 win on Tuesday against Moldovan side Sheriff. Former Newcastle United player Temuri Ketsbaia, who took over as Olympiakos manager in the offseason, has bolstered the team's defense by signing Swedish international Olof Mellberg on a three-year contract from Juventus but has made no other major acquisitions. 'We're always looking for (new) players. But I'm the coach, and I have to work with the players we have. We have to be ready to face AEK,' Ketsbaia said. In contrast, archrival Panathinaikos has made a number of high profile signings, including 29-year-old French striker Djibril Cisse from Marseille on a four-year contract worth more than euro20 million (US$28.5 million). It has also snapped up Sebastian Leto from Liverpool after he spent last season in Greece on loan to Olympiakos. The Athens club lost its opening European game Wednesday, 3-2 at home to Atletico Madrid, and looks unlikely to progress further in the Champions League. This weekend, Panathinaikos faces lowly Ergotelis, and Dutch coach Henk Ten Cate said he's looking to get off to a good start, with the league his top priority. 'The league is our number one target. Everyone knows that,' Ten Cate said. 'I saw a lot of positive things in the (Atletico) game -- things we can build on. So I'm optimistic about the (Greek) championship.' AEK and PAOK Thessaloniki face action in the Europa League playoffs. But the Athens club has already suffered a serious setback to its domestic title hopes, losing central defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos to Liverpool. The 16-team, 30-round league will last through April 18, 2010 and will include breaks for World Cup qualifiers. After 28 years in the lower divisions, Kavala returns to Greece's top flight. Giannina, another provincial club, has also returned after a 10-year absence, along with Atromitos which spent last season in the second division. In other first-round games this weekend it's: Aris vs.Atromitos, Xanthi vs.Giannina, Asteras vs.Larissa, Levadiakos vs.Kavala, Panthrakikos vs.Iraklis, and Panionios vs.PAOK. "
1,"'Youngblood,' the jazz greats would whisper in whiskey-smooth voices to a young Quincy Jones, 'step into my office.' The office could have been a backstage hallway anywhere with musicians practicing bebop. Or a juke joint in downtown Seattle, where Billie Holiday had to be helped onstage. The office might have been a jazz club corridor with broken lights and a 17-year-old Ray Charles, who 'might as well have been 100 because he had his own girlfriend and apartment.' The office might have been a seat on a bus traveling with the Lionel Hampton Band. In the 'office,' the older musicians would educate Jones about music and life. 'Youngblood, you gotta ...' Jones recalls them saying as he sits at a corner table in the bar lounge at the Ritz-Carlton in Northwest Washington. Jones has come to town to promote his new book, 'Q on Producing.' In the book _ the first of three in 'The Quincy Jones Legacy Series,' written with Bill Gibson _ Jones dispenses advice to a younger generation, which he says doesn't seem to understand its music history or recognize its musical heroes. The book is Jones' 'step into my office' lesson for younger musicians. 'I talk a lot now,' he says, 'but I used to sit down, shut up and listen.' Jones was only 14 in 1947 when he joined a jazz band in Seattle. Throughout his career, there was always someone older on the scene to 'school' Jones. Jones pauses. Ice cubes clink in glasses at the bar. 'Count Basie practically adopted me when I was 13. I would play hooky and go down to (Seattle's now- defunct) Palomar Theatre.' The jazz tenor saxophonist Ben Webster would say, 'Step into my office. Let me pull your coat for a minute,' Jones recalls. 'That is the way they would say it then: (begin ital) Let me pull your coat for a minute. Come over here. I want to teach you something.'(end ital) Basie would tell him, 'This business is all about hills and valleys. You find out what you're made out of when you're in the valleys,' Jones says. ...'That's why it comes easy for me to help young guys, because I was given a hand up when I was young.' John Coltrane reminded Jones to study Nicolas Slonimsky's 'Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns,' which Jones read in school. 'Coltrane always had Slonimsky's book with him.' he says. Nadia Boulanger, a famous composition teacher in France, told him, 'Quincy, your music can never be more or less than you are as a human being.' For more than six decades of his life, Jones has worked with music's greats: Duke Ellington, Coltrane, Basie, Miles Davis. His hits as a producer range from Lesley Gore's 'It's My Party' to Michael Jackson's 'Off the Wall,' 'Thriller' and 'Bad,' and Frank Sinatra's 'Sinatra at the Sands.' Jones' latest album, to be released this month, is 'Q: Soul Bossa Nostra,' which features contemporary artists such as Usher, Ludacris, Jennifer Hudson and Amy Winehouse singing Jones' hits. Jones has won 27 Grammy Awards, the most of any living musician, and garnered 79 Grammy nominations, the most in music history. His influence on the entertainment industry is almost omnipresent: He helped Michael Jackson start his solo career; persuaded Davis to give a concert in Montreux, Switzerland; chose Oprah for a starring role in 'The Color Purple,' which he produced with Steven Spielberg. He also produced 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,' which starred Will Smith. It was Jones who had the star power to put 46 celebrities in one room to sing 'We Are the World' to raise money for famine relief. (Begin optional trim) It's a still day outside, but in the Ritz lounge, it might as well be around midnight. The light is low. Jones sits in a booth orchestrating the conversation, talking about his childhood, his passion for music. A parade of people recognize the producer. They reach over the table and he reaches out with his right hand, the one with the golden pinky ring Sinatra gave him. Jones is gracious, a silky man in a silky black suit, a gold earring in one ear. He acts like a man who has nothing to lose and a lot to teach.(begin ital) Everybody, (end ital)Jones says, is interesting. (begin ital)Everybody (end ital)has a story to tell. (begin ital)Everybody (end ital)needs music and the life lessons music can teach. (End optional trim) A few years ago, Jones was visiting his high school alma mater in Seattle. Garfield High was renaming the performance arts center after him. Some students gathered around Jones after the ceremony. One youth told Jones he wanted to be a rapper and asked what he needed to do. Jones asked him, 'Do you know who Louis Armstrong was? . ...Do you know who Duke Ellington was? . ...Do know about Dizzy Gillespie?' The kid said no. Did he know Davis, Coltrane, Thelonious Monk? No, the kid said. The incident disturbed Jones. The student was there to help name a building after Jones, but 'the young man had no idea who the men were who put me on their shoulders and helped me as a young musician.' For this lack of knowledge, Jones mostly faults public education, which he says does a poor job these days of teaching students the history of music in the United States. But he also says parents of children interested in music should 'force-feed' them music, making them practice their scales at least four hours a day so they become proficient in music and eventually 'have something to work with.' When young people ask Jones how they can break into the music industry or get better, he advises them to choose 10 songs they like best and play them repeatedly. Often, he gives them a copy of Davis' 'Kind of Blue,' telling them to 'Take this every day, like it's orange juice.' Listen, he tells them, to Miles and Coltrane. Listen to Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderley. The legendary musicians are important, he tells them, because everybody from 'Marvin Gaye to Earth, Wind and Fire to Stevie Wonder to Michael Jackson, owes a debt to that tradition.' (Begin optional trim) Listen, he tells them, to the song 'Baby Be Mine' on the album 'Thriller,' which Jones produced in 1982 with Jackson. 'Thriller' became the best-selling album in U.S. music history. 'The song,' Jones says, 'has pop lyrics and a beat, but that's Coltrane, baby, Coltrane all the way.' The new book includes practical advice: 'You have to develop your skills until you really know what you're talking about _ really know deep down inside.' That's what the greats do, he says. Herbie Hancock, Sinatra, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Patti Austin. 'I've seen Aretha sit at a piano and sing a line over and over again,' Jones says. 'She might sing it 20 or more times, exploring her voice, developing it, finding out what its capabilities are.' Music is 'a science, too, and if you don't deal with the science, the soul can't play or sing the way it should.' (End optional trim) When Jones was 11, music became his mother. You can still see the pain in his face 66 years later. As a child, Jones watched as his mother, Sarah, who was suffering from dementia, was sent away to a mental institution. 'They put her in a straitjacket,' he says, the expression in his eyes deepening. 'For me that was the end of what mother meant. Whoever has had a mother does not know what I am talking about. And I don't know what they are talking about.' After his mother was hospitalized, Jones and his younger brother Lloyd were sent to Louisville, Ky., to live with their grandmother, a former slave. She used to send them to catch river rats. And she would fry them. In 1943, the boys went back to Chicago to live with their father, Quincy Delight Jones Sr., who worked as a carpenter for the Jones Boys, one of the most notorious black gangs in Chicago. 'Chicago had the biggest black ghetto in America,' he says. 'It made Compton and Harlem look like Boys Town.' The city's African-Americans 'were buying music before they bought clothes or food, just to keep their souls together.' Gangsters controlled every block. One day Jones ended up on the wrong street and some gangsters grabbed him. 'They put my hand up against a fence and stabbed it with a switchblade.' Then, he said, they took an ice pick 'and stabbed it into my temple.' Quincy thought he would die. Jones' father found the young Quincy and beat off the young criminals. The gang situation heated up in Chicago, Al Capone's gang members put pressure on the Jones Boys, and Quincy's father, who was not a gang member, left town because his name was associated with the Jones Boys. The family headed by bus to the state of Washington, settling in Bremerton near Seattle. 'Lloyd and I had a stepmother that I don't even like to think about,' he says. 'She was illiterate and mean. ... Daddy was working all the time. He did the best he could.' The hard life shaped him, he says. 'If I had a good family, I might have been a terrible musician,' he says. In Bremerton, Jones says, he and Lloyd were 'baby gangsters.' 'We were stealing everything in sight.' One night they heard about a shipment of lemon pies coming into the armory. They broke in, ate pie and then, 'just for the hell of it,' Jones recalls, he broke into other rooms. Inside one room was a spinet piano. 'I almost closed the door,' Jones says. 'But God said, `Go back in that room!' And that saved my life.' Jones walked over to the piano and touched it. 'Every cell in my body, every drop of blood said, `This is where you will live the rest of your life.' ' He went back to school and studied piano. Before long he had learned all the instruments in the band. At 12, he could hear the roles of different instruments in a song. 'That's when I knew it was in my DNA to be an arranger and composer.' Jones stops his story and shakes someone's hand and hugs a skinny woman in a red dress. He continues. At Garfield High, Jones wrote his first composition, 'Suite to the Four Winds.' He sent a copy to the Schillinger House, now called Berklee College of Music, where he was given a scholarship. A year later he left school to tour with Lionel Hampton. Jones began his producing career, rising in 1961 to become vice president of Mercury Records. He won his first Grammy in 1963. He left the record company and went to California, where he wrote scores for film, including 'The Pawnbroker,' 'In the Heat of the Night' and 'The Color Purple.' In 1967, he received two Oscar nominations, for Best Original Score for 'In Cold Blood' and Best Original Song for 'The Eyes of Love' from the film 'Banning.' He composed the themes for 'Ironside,' 'Sanford and Son' and 'The Bill Cosby Show,' and wrote the score for 'Roots.' In 1977, Jones was asked to work on the score for 'The Wiz.' This time it would be Jones' turn to ask a younger artist to step into his office. Michael Jackson had been cast in 'The Wiz' to play the part of the Scarecrow. Jackson's character pulled pieces of paper out of his chest and read quotes from philosophers. 'He'd say the quote and then the philosopher's name,' Jones recalls. Jackson would read the quote, then say 'Confucius.' Then he'd read the next quote. When Jackson got to Socrates, he pronounced it 'So-KRAY-teez.' 'He kept saying `So-KRAY-teez.' Diana didn't interrupt him,' Jones says, referring to Diana Ross. Neither did Sidney Lumet, nor Nipsey Russell. The second day, Jones asked Jackson to step into his office. 'Michael, it's `SOCK-ra-teez,' not `So-KRAY-teez.' ' Jackson said, 'Really!' And Jones saw 'the sweetest look' on Jackson's face. 'I saw something in him I'd never seen before: a special kind of innocence and sensitivity.' In that moment, Jones saw more potential in Jackson. He says, 'Everybody said, `You can't make Michael any bigger than he was in the Jackson 5.' I said, `We'll see.' ' Jones told Jackson he'd work with him on an album. But Epic Records said no _ 'Quincy's too jazzy. He's a jazz arranger and composer,' he recalls. But Jackson's managers insisted on Jones producing the album. Jones was interested in Jackson singing in a lower key. He had seen Jackson on the Oscars singing 'Ben,' a love song about a rat. 'I said, `Let's try a woman.' ... I'd been hanging onto a song called `She's Out of My Life.' ' 'Off the Wall' became one of the top-selling albums in music history. Jackson was one of the hardest-working musicians he had ever seen, Jones says. In the studio, he let Jackson dance and perform while he was recording. They would dim the studio and put a pin light on Jackson, who would dance. Jones left the sound of Jackson's dancing on the recordings. What is the music industry like without Jackson? 'There is a spiritual energy and a chemical energy,' Jones says. 'The chemical energy leaves you. We are left with his creative spirit.' He stops as if on cue. An assistant breaks in and tells him a children's choir is waiting to meet him. The producer rises, blows kisses, makes his way through the crowd at the Ritz, heading for his 'office.' He has more young people to school. "
1,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Muslim extremists of being behind recent violence in Jerusalem and said Monday they spread baseless lies to 'undermine the peaceful life' in the holy city. The comments followed days of low-level unrest at the city's most sacred shrine. The violence has added to regional tensions fueled by stalled peace efforts, Israeli construction in Jewish settlements and a U.N. report accusing Israel of committing war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Late Sunday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of 'Judaizing' Jerusalem and undermining Palestinian claims to the city. In an about-face, he also announced he would push for a vote in the U.N. on the Gaza report, a move that could ultimately lead to war crimes proceedings against Israel. Israel put thousands of police on high alert in Jerusalem last week after several days of scuffles between police and Palestinians around the disputed hilltop compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The competing claims to the site -- home to the biblical Jewish Temples and to the Al Aqsa Mosque -- is seen as the most intractable issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab protests around the site were fed in part by rumors by local Muslim leaders that Israel was digging tunnels under the mosque and planning to take over the site. 'I wish to clarify. This is an unfounded lie,' Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Monday. 'Last week, extremists tried to undermine the peaceful life in Jerusalem,' he said. 'I appreciate the fact that the vast majority of Arab Israeli citizens did not follow the provocations and did not let the extremists exploit the lies.' He also appealed for coexistence with Israel's Arabs, who make up about one-fifth of Israel's 7 million citizens. Netanyahu's comments were his first on the Jerusalem unrest, which has added to growing mistrust of the Israeli leader in the Arab world. Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem. Netanyahu insists Israel will retain control over the entire city, including the eastern sector it captured and annexed in 1967. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to the most sensitive religious sites, as the capital of a future independent state. The dispute over Jerusalem has been one of the factors in President Barack Obama's inability to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Obama's envoy, George Mitchell, left the region on Sunday after again having failed to reach a deal on resuming talks. The Palestinians say they won't resume talks unless Israel agrees to discuss the fate of east Jerusalem and halts all construction in settlements built there and in the neighboring West Bank. Netanyahu says he will never share control of the holy city, and that some settlement construction must continue to accommodate 'natural growth' in settler populations. In his televised speech Sunday, Abbas accused Israel of undermining Palestinian hopes for independence through its policies in east Jerusalem. 'The Al Aqsa Mosque has become a specific target of the occupation and the extremists. So has Judaizing Jerusalem and changing the Islamic and Arab features of the city,' he said. 'Toying with the city will lead to nothing but war in the region.' Abbas also said he would push for a vote on the United Nations report that accuses Israel and Hamas militants of committing war crimes during fighting last winter. Abbas' statement reverses a decision earlier this month when Palestinian officials led by Abbas said they would delay the vote in the U.N. Human Rights Council for six months. The decision, which came under heavy U.S. pressure, sparked sharp criticism and protests across Palestinian society, particularly from the rival Hamas militant group's government in the Gaza Strip. It left Abbas at the lowest point in his presidency and he has been scrambling since to repair the damage. 'I have instructed our ambassador in Geneva to contact the groups to have an exceptional session of the council, and to move in this direction until in the end, having those who committed the worst, ugliest crimes against our people punished,' Abbas said. It remained unclear if renewed Palestinian support would bring about a vote. However, the council includes many Palestinian allies and has a history of passing resolutions highly critical of Israel. Netanyahu has warned the Palestinians that peace prospects would be significantly damaged if they pushed forward with the war crimes case against Israel. Israel launched the three-week offensive last December in response to years of Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,400 Palestinians were killed, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian officials and human rights groups. The U.N. report accused Israel of using disproportionate force, deliberately harming civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure, and using people as human shields. It also accused Hamas of deliberately targeting civilians and trying to spread terror through its rocket attacks. "
1,"Washington area boozers were breathing a bit easier this week following news reports that an audit by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department found some 80 percent of its 'breathalyzer' alcohol monitors may have been giving faulty readings. The impact on current and past DUI cases is uncertain. But one thing is for sure: Breath analysis devices are society's front-line weapon against drunken driving, and they need to be unassailably accurate. Many well-calibrated units are, and the technology has improved dramatically since the original 'drunkometer' made its highway debut in 1938. But even today's most impressive devices may soon seem downright primitive, thanks to relentless progress in microsensor science. In the fast-growing, fast- shrinking field of single-molecule detection, some gizmos are now able to spot substances in the parts-per-trillion range. Sensors known as 'e-noses' function as artificial snouts that can identify the barest trace of compounds in the air, while microfluidic 'lab on a chip' sensors can flag individual DNA strands and other entities in liquids. Few of them are commercialized as yet. But the trend portends a revolution in public safety, according to Stephen Semancik, who heads the Chemical Microsensor Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 'What we can't smell can hurt us,' he says, citing dangers from carbon monoxide to spoiled food, low-level industrial toxins, water contaminants and building fires where 'five minutes can be life or death.' The smaller the amount you can detect, the earlier your warning. For example, to be perfectly morbid, in the event that terrorists use chemical weapons, you really don't want to wait until concentrations reach levels at which your commuter train seatmate says, 'Hey, what's that funny odor?' At that point, even if you just got on the train, you're probably at the end of the line. In medical applications, Semancik says, 'smelling other kinds of molecules might be able to help us in early disease detection.' He foresees breath-type detectors deployed to detect a host of maladies, including skin cancer (recognizable now by trained dogs), diabetes (whose sufferers exhale a telltale scent of acetone, the working ingredient in nail-polish remover) and cystic fibrosis (where breath is abnormally acidic and rich in sulfur compounds). If sniffer diagnostics could be used for initial screening in lieu of a battery of expensive and invasive tests, both patients and the health-care system would benefit. Whatever their uses, the next microsensors will be small, highly automated and sufficiently sensitive to operate in the chemical cacophony of the real world. There are numerous designs. In a typical mechanical system, airborne molecules stick to the end of a microscopic cantilever. Just as a diving board vibrates differently if it's occupied by your 6 year old or your double-wide neighbor, the vibrational frequency of the tiny cantilever changes in response to the mass of the molecule trapped on it and sounds the alarm when its target compound shows up. Other mechanical systems use nanoscale tubes (that is, with dimensions in the range of billionths of a meter) to snag pathogens by size. For example, University of Missouri scientists recently created a glass 'nanopore' system custom-tailored to trap single molecules of ricin, a nasty little poison extracted from castor beans. Optical systems sense changes in the properties of transmitted or reflected light that occur when the molecule of interest binds to another molecule or undergoes a chemical reaction. David Walt of Tufts University devised a novel variation: 'My lab recently demonstrated that we could isolate single molecules into very tiny wells etched into the end of a fiber optic bundle,' Walt said in an e-mail. The bundle had tens of thousands of such wells, each just big enough for one target DNA molecule coated with special compounds that would react with the DNA to produce fluorescence. When a solution containing the molecules flowed across the bundle, wells that trapped the molecules lit up. Counting the ratio of dark to light fibers in the bundle, Walt's team was able to determine the concentration of molecules in the solution to unprecedented accuracy. But the ultimate goal is to get out of the lab. 'I believe that the focus of this field is moving from `sensors' to `point of care technologies' (POCT) that bring bioanalytic methods from the laboratory to the point of need, whether it is the bedside, emergency room or for preventative medicine such as cholesterol monitoring,' Jerome Schultz, chair of the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California at Riverside, said in an e-mail. 'This type of device would have wide applications for water quality, especially for third world countries, food contamination and bioterrorism.' If such sensors can be made sufficiently small, sensitive and cheap, the public could become a giant roving detection system. 'We all have cellphones now,' Semancik says. 'Suppose we put a chemical sensor in every phone?' If it encountered a threat, it would send out a signal. If the monitoring system started getting lots of the same signals from one place (as determined by the phones' GPS locators), responders could home in on the threat. Boozers, beware. Before you know it, the old cliche will become the new reality: They can smell you coming a mile away. "

1,"Given the news these days of the endlessly spewing oil in the gulf, you might ask: Can't the folks at the Interior Department's old Minerals Management Service get anything right? Well, maybe not. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar signed an executive order last week that reorganized and renamed the MMS, which oversaw oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf, christening it the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement. The department, in an announcement, noted a shorthand version: Bureau of Ocean Energy, or BOE. In his 'Hello' e-mail to MMS employees, new BOE chief Michael Bromwich also noted the name change to BOE, saying he hoped it would be 'the first step in a series of more substantive and meaningful changes' in the near future. Not so fast, James Anderson, the newly named organization's acting associate director for administration and budget, said in an e-mail Friday to the MMS executive committee (where we use italics, he used underlining _ and, in the second case, boldface as well): 'Please be advised that (begin italics) BOE should not be used <I>(</I> end italics<I>) </I> as the abbreviation. ... Until further notice, the abbreviation (begin italics) BOEMRE should be used (end italics). Administration division chiefs and program chiefs of staff have been included on this message so as they can disseminate this information to the appropriate points of contact.' (Presumably that includes Bromwich.) Anderson doesn't address proper pronunciation, but perhaps it should be 'bummer.' _ _ _ Meanwhile, the enviro group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) is auctioning off original MMS memorabilia accumulated over the years. Yes, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have your own piece of this bureaucratic Enron. There's the usual assortment of gym bags, pins, lanyards, 25th-anniversary laptop bags and such. But then there are the truly coveted items, such as 'Petey, the Petroleum-Loving Whale' _ actually, PEER made that name up _ a little rubber toy whale embossed with 'MMS Environmental Studies Program,' starting bid $50. There's the exquisitely timed MMS 'Oil Drop Paperweight,' a 2 1/2-inch acrylic square containing an oil droplet from off the Alaska coast ($125), as well as a particular favorite, the 'Antimicrobial Telephone Pad' with, for the truly phobic, an MMS hand sanitizer (both for $50). These are prized historically, being from the last-ever MMS Safety Day, in 2009. (This year's luncheon for safety awards, scheduled for May 3, was canceled after the April 20 calamity.) Our top choice, though, is the beautifully framed Al Gore Hammer Award for high- performing federal employees ($100). This one was for the agency's Innovative Achievements Program acknowledging the agency's and staff's commitment to customer service, PEER said. (No, this was given in 1997, long before that IG report of an MMS staffer having sex with an oil company employee.) The message from Gore reads: 'Thanks for building a government that works better and costs less!' Ah, yes. Bidding begins Wednesday morning at 9 a.m. and closes July 7 at 9 a.m. We'll update as needed. (P.S. PEER is looking for other precious memorabilia _ T-shirts, windbreakers, mugs, etc. _ to use in future auctions.) _ _ _ While fears about 'burrowing' _ political types sliding into career jobs _ run especially high during presidential-election years, a new study by the Government Accountability Office has found only seven cases of burrowing during the Bush administration, none of them near the 2008 election. The GAO looked at 'conversions,' or movement from political to civil service positions, from May 2005 and May 2009, finding only 139. Of those, the GAO found only seven that were clearly improper. (We've always thought such conversions were almost by definition improper, inherently subject to chicanery and so on, but never mind.) "
1,"Unemployment rates in the Carolinas, Florida, and Delaware reached record highs as joblessness rose in 43 states in December. South Carolina set a new high with 12.6 percent unemployment; Florida, 11.8 percent; North Carolina, 11.2 percent; and Delaware, 9 percent, according to figures issued Friday by the Labor Department in Washington. At 12.1 percent, Washington, D.C., also reached the highest level in monthly records dating back to 1976. Employment is 'still very weak, which is why we think the unemployment rate is going to continue to rise,' Marisa Di Natale, a director at Moody's Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., said before the report. 'There are some states that are in pretty big trouble, fiscally speaking. 2010 is not going to be a good year.' Mississippi and New Jersey both breached the 10 percent mark, leaving 16 states with double-digit rates. Michigan remained in the worst shape at 14.6 percent, followed by Nevada at 13 percent and Rhode Island at 12.9 percent. As for payrolls, California showed the biggest decline with a drop of 38,800. Texas followed with a 23,900 decline and Ohio was next with a 16,700 drop. Nationally, the jobless rate held at 10 percent as payrolls fell by 85,000. The U.S. has lost 7.2 million since the start of the recession in December 2007, the most of any slowdown in the post-World War II era. Employment dropped in 39 states in December, seven more than in the prior month, indicating job losses were widespread. With the national unemployment rate projected to average 10 percent this year, state budgets may continue to be strained by limited tax revenue and jobless insurance payments. While the pace of firings has eased over the last year, the time it is taking to find a job rose to a record 29.1 weeks in December. The jobless rate held at 10 percent nationwide in December, the Labor Department said on Jan. 8. A jump in the number of discouraged workers leaving the labor market kept the rate from rising. The number of states with at least 10 percent unemployment climbed to 16 last month, two more than in November, Friday's report showed. Mississippi, with a jobless rate of 10.6 percent, and New Jersey, at 10.1 percent, joined the list. New Jersey's rate was the highest in 32 years. 'I try to make the connections, I meet people and give them follow-up e-mails, nothing right now seems to work,' said Kyra DeBlaker-Gebhard, who lives in the nation's capital. 'I'm concerned the longer I'm not working the less desirable I look.' DeBlaker-Gebhard, 32, lost her job with AARP in Washington, the advocacy group for the elderly, in March. She worked as a contractor for the government from July through October and has since resumed collecting unemployment benefits while sending out resumes. She has had two interviews in the last year. 'I don't feel confident,' DeBlaker-Gebhard said. 'Even part-time jobs are hard to come by.' "
1,"The fashion savants at Anthropologie always seem to find a way to turn a traditional item into a star. This season, they've done just that with the Josef wingback chair ($1,698), which is dressed in a bold African print dubbed pink shell. A group of melamine trays in bold and intricate patterns is part of Target's latest line with New York designer Thomas O'Brien (rectangle trays $4.99, large round tray $24.99). For O'Brien, a tray is a signature statement, a miniature tabletop for displaying collections. He calls it 'the smallest piece of furniture I make.' The prints _ taken from a batik fabric, an Indian ivory box and a piece of English Chippendale fretwork _ were inspired by objects found in his travels. "
1,"What's a phone call worth these days? A Verizon phone booth in a Washington subway station suggests one answer: 50 cents. Another comes from Verizon's cheapest landline service option, which charges 10.2 cents a call. If you use a cellphone or subscribe to a voice-over-Internet-Protocol calling plan, the number shrinks to a vanishingly tiny fraction of your monthly bill: maybe a few pennies each time you dial out? But if you use Google's new, free phone-calling option (gmail.com/call), that figure drops to zero. Last week, the Web giant announced that American users of its Gmail Web service could call numbers in the United States and Canada for free from within their browsers. Calls elsewhere cost less than many traditional long-distance domestic calls: You pay 2 cents a minute to call Ireland, Korea, Argentina and many other countries. (Google's rates top out at 99 cents a minute for those calling the island nation of Nauru.) The Skype Internet-calling service charges slightly more for international calls, but it also charges about 2 cents a minute for domestic calls. Gmail's rates should be familiar to users of Google's free Google Voice service, a separate option that the Mountain View, Calif., company only opened to the public in June. But using Google Voice requires logging into a website or launching a program on your phone (if one is available for it) and, in some cases, waiting for Google to connect your call. Calling from within Gmail, by contrast, requires nothing more than installing a small plug-in program (available for Windows XP or newer, Mac OS X 10.4 or newer and some versions of Linux) and logging into Gmail. Click the 'Call phone' link to the left of your inbox, type in a number, click the big blue 'Call' button and things proceed as if you had just finished spinning a Bell System phone's rotary dial. If you have a Google Voice account, the other person will see that number in their caller ID. You can also answer their calls from within Gmail; an incoming call will generate an alert in the bottom right corner of the Gmail window, which you can click to answer. If you don't have a Voice account, the other party will see a special number Google has set up, 760-705-8888. Calls to that yield a message advertising the new Gmail feature. I've used Google's voice calling from the Safari and Firefox browsers on a Mac, as well as copies of Firefox running in Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. Everything sounded fine to me, although one co-worker commented that my own voice sounded as if I were underwater. (That may be the fault of the simple external microphone I used on my work desktop _ a giveaway from Skype's public-relations department.) Google says more than 1 million calls were placed through Gmail in its first 24 hours. It's unclear how many of them consisted of people dialing their cellphones, recording a voicemail message to the effect of, 'Hi, this is me calling through Gmail,' and then hanging up. Google won't say whether domestic calling will remain free, but it has structured this service and Google Voice to stay afloat based on the profit generated by international calling. Unlike Gmail itself and many other Google applications, advertising doesn't factor into this _ a detail that its privacy policy ought to spell out but does not. In other words, as spokesman Randall Sarafa wrote in a recent e-mail, 'Google absolutely does not record or listen in on phone conversations.' Placing a call through a Web browser may not be for everybody. But the ability to do this could change how even the tech-averse make and pay for phone calls. Think about what Gmail did for e-mail: By offering effectively unlimited storage and inviting users to hold on to their old e-mail forever _ after Microsoft and Yahoo had steadily cut back on the storage offered to users of their free Web- mail services _ Google pounded the market price for each message all the way down to $0.00. Phone use has been edging in that direction for a while, coaxed along by steadily expanding blocks of unmetered domestic calling time on wireless plans and the growing allotments of 'VoIP' services such as Skype and Vonage. Google's latest move can only accelerate that trend. Incumbent carriers will have to respond accordingly. But don't feel too bad for the telecom firms. At least until Google or somebody else makes a serious run at that market, those companies seem secure in being able to charge an unhealthy premium for text messaging. "
1,"BP, the worst oil investment this year on Wall Street, is finding its backers in the City of London. Investors piled more money behind 'buy' trades than 'sell' ones in London since the April 20 rig explosion, according to so-called money flow data compiled by Bloomberg, even as the stock slumped to a 13-year low. By contrast, BP's American depositary receipts have recorded a net $185 million outflow in New York, the data show. As the worst oil spill in U.S. history spurs attacks from President Barack Obama and soils Florida's beaches and the Louisiana marshlands, London investors are backing BP's embattled chief executive officer, Tony Hayward. After a five- year string of accidents and deadly disasters at BP facilities, Rep. Bart Stupak, d-Mich., suggested last week its safety record could justify pulling the company's operating permits in the United States. 'There's a feeling in the U.K. that BP has been singled out unfairly and that there's long-term value in the stock,' said Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, which oversees more than $31 billion in London and increased its BP holdings in May. 'In the U.S., it's a very emotive issue, and politicians are making it much more personal and vindictive. If you're a U.S. fund manager and BP doesn't manage to stop the leak, you've got a lot to answer for.' Hayward drew criticism again this weekend after attending a yacht race off the south coast of England, watching sailboats on the Solent at a time when fishing in the Gulf of Mexico is curtailed because of BP's spill. Hayward's attendance was 'part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes,' White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said on ABC's 'This Week' television program. 'We can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting.' BP agreed last week to cancel nine months of dividend payments, saving about $7.5 billion, sell $10 billion of assets and reduce investment to raise cash to meet Obama's demand for a $20 billion fund for victims of the spill. 'When people turn on the news they see this gusher pouring out,' said Ronald Sorenson, CEO of W.H. Reaves & Co. in Jersey City, N.J., which manages $1.6 billion in assets, including BP shares. 'That puts a lot of pressure on advisers. Individual investors take this very personally.' Sorenson said he's sold shares for individual investors since the spill began. The London-listed stock is down 47 percent since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and started the leak on the seabed. The shares fell to a 13-year low on June 15, wiping about $89 billion off the company's value. Money flow attempts to measure the capital moving in and out of a security by adding the value of higher, or uptick, trades and subtracting the value of downticks. As prices fall, money flows are usually negative, turning positive as prices rise. A divergence between money flow and price may signal a change in the trend. 'People in the U.K. are buying the stock, taking advantage of the discount' since the stock plunged, said Cleve Rueckert, an equity analyst at Birinyi's firm. 'But when a stock starts to slide like this, it's hard to say when it will turn around.'

1,"Maurice J. Williams, an international development specialist who retired in 1986 as executive director of the United Nations World Food Council in Rome, died May 10 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 89 and had complications from a fall. Williams spent eight years overseeing the now-defunct World Food Council, a food policy arm of the United Nations that sought to end world hunger and draw attention to famine. He served several years with the CIA before joining the U.S. Agency for International Development in 1958. He helped administer aid programs in the Near East and South Asia and was named deputy director of USAID in 1970. During the next several years, he was a presidential coordinator for major foreign disaster relief efforts from Bangladesh to Nicaragua and served as chief U.S. negotiator on post-Vietnam War aid talks with North Vietnam. From 1974 to 1978, he was chairman of the development assistance committee of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international research group. Maurice Jacoutot Williams was born in Moncton, New Brunswick. He became a U.S. citizen as a young man. He attended Northwestern University in Illinois before serving in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. He received a master's degree in economics from the University of Chicago in 1949. His honors included the USAID Distinguished Honor Award and the Rockefeller Public Service Award. In retirement, he ran a part-time consulting business in overseas development. He divided his retirement years between homes in the D.C. area and St. Petersburg, Fla., and then made Florida his full-time residence in 2006. His memberships included the Cosmos Club in Washington. His first wife, Betty Bath Williams, whom he married in 1943, died in 2006. Survivors include his wife, Joan Dunn Williams of St. Petersburg; three sons from his first marriage, Jon Williams and Stephen Williams, both of Washington, and Peter Williams of Cleveland; four grandchildren; and three great- grandchildren.

1,"You've got to give the girl credit. In an age of communication dominated by e-mail, texting and tweets, the 24-year-old actress Amanda Seyfried _ star of 'Dear John' and now 'Letters to Juliet' _ seems to be on a one-woman quest to revive the lost art of letter writing. But if putting pen to paper is as much of a chore as watching her new movie, the stationery industry is doomed. In 'Letters,' Seyfried plays Sophie, a fact checker for the New Yorker who dreams of becoming a writer. While vacationing in Verona, Italy, she wanders into the House of Juliet, a place where, according to custom, the lovelorn leave letters seeking romantic advice from Shakespeare's tragic heroine. Not that she's any kind of authority on the subject, and anyway, she's fictional. But never mind. A colorful group of older female volunteers answers every one. Although Sophie hasn't figured it out yet, she herself is among the heartbroken. Her fiance, Victor (Gael Garc a Bernal), with whom she's traveling, just isn't that into her. A self-absorbed chef, he seems to be more in love with whatever bit of pasta, pastry, olive oil or wine he has just popped into his mouth. With a look Sophie wishes he'd reserve for her, Victor goes through the movie pronouncing everything edible 'amazing' or 'incredible.' (Really, the guy could use a couple of new adjectives. I lost track after a dozen instances of each.) Left on her own, Sophie naturally gravitates to the Miss Lonelyhearts at the House of Juliet, who take her under their nurturing wings. But not as a client. After Sophie finds an old letter written by a British teenager named Claire who'd fallen in love with and then left an Italian boy named Lorenzo Bartolini _ a letter written in 1957, but never answered _ Sophie takes it upon herself to compose a reply. The gist of it is this: When it comes to love, it's never too late. That's not advice; that's a fortune cookie. The next thing we know, Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), now a senior citizen, has shown up with her handsome but surly grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan), in search of the lost Lorenzo. Against Charlie's better instincts _ he thinks the whole thing is a dumb idea _ Sophie tags along as navigator and chronicler of the search. Although Charlie and Sophie bicker insufferably at first, they will soon be canoodling. The screenwriters having decided, in their infinite matchmaking wisdom, that it makes sense to substitute one good-looking jerk for another. It doesn't. Some mild humor results from the fact that Lorenzo Bartolini is a popular Italian name. There's even a famous 19th-century sculptor with that name. Without spoiling things, it can be said that Franco Nero plays the grown-up Lorenzo in question and that the Italian actor is married to Redgrave in real life. The couple, who wed in 2006, reunited in storybook fashion after a separation of 36 years, following an affair that began on the set of 'Camelot' and produced a son. Perhaps you see where all this is going. If not, it's all there in the trailer. That's my advice to you, which doesn't even require a 44-cent stamp: Save yourself 10 bucks, and an hour and 45 minutes of your precious time. PG. Contains crude language and smoking. 105 minutes. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell's announcement that the state registered a modest surplus in the fiscal year that ended last month is good news, but it's the sort of good news that comes with a large asterisk. It reflects, among other things, the fact that while revenue collected by the state continued to shrink, it didn't shrink quite as alarmingly as had been forecast. Like we said: a large asterisk. The asterisk looms even larger when you examine the fine print. The state points out that better-than-expected individual and corporate tax collections were the immediate causes of the $220 million surplus in the state's $14.2 billion general fund. But that unexpected tonic was dwarfed by the deluge of revenue from the federal stimulus package, which alone added about $700 million to the state's Medicaid program last year. With the stimulus money running out fast, more austerity is probably on the horizon. On his way to declaring a surplus, Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, also benefited from some budgetary legerdemain, and not just his own. For instance, thanks to a measure approved by his Democratic predecessor, Timothy M. Kaine, Virginia speeded up its sales tax collections from the state's 1,000 largest retailers, shifting $227 million in revenue from the current fiscal year into the one just ended. In a similar vein, Mr. McDonnell postponed $135 million in payments to the Virginia Retirement System for public employees, which were due in the last quarter of the fiscal year. Both those maneuvers will cost the state when it returns to a regular sales tax collection schedule and repays its retirement system. Nonetheless, they allowed the governor to sidestep some extremely unpleasant budgetary choices for the time being. Without them, Mr. McDonnell would have had to raise across-the-board taxes, which he has vowed not to do, or made further draconian cuts to a budget already pulverized by the economic downturn. In the past three years, more than $7 billion in cumulative spending has been lopped from Virginia budgets, dealing severe blows to the state's colleges and universities; its ability to build and maintain roads and bridges; its support for localities and schools; and social services of every description. Despite inflation, aging infrastructure, a growing population and the widespread social needs caused by the recession, Virginia is spending no more than it did four years ago. The small surplus that Mr. McDonnell declared will not even begin to make a dent in any of that. What it will do is produce a one-time, 3 percent bonus for more than 100,000 state employees _ their first raise in three years _ and free a little more money for schools and cleaning the Chesapeake Bay. It would be nice to believe, as Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., said, that Mr. McDonnell's 'bold actions' in generating a small surplus could serve as a lesson for the federal government. In fact, budgeting at all levels and in nearly every state is these days mostly about temporizing _ and hoping the worst is over. "
1,"Oil prices rose $2 to above $68 a barrel Thursday, resuming a three-month rally after a jump in U.S. crude inventories triggered a sharp pullback a day earlier. The slump of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies helped boost oil prices, as investors buy into commodities to safeguard against inflation and dollar weakness. Benchmark crude for July delivery was up $2.05 to $68.17 a barrel by mid-afternoon in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract tumbled $2.43 to settle at $66.12. In London, Brent prices rose $2.30 to $68.18 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. Oil soared to seven-month highs earlier this week -- double the price in March -- on investor expectations that a dismal U.S. economy could be stabilizing. But the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude in storage unexpectedly rose by nearly 3 million barrels to about 20 percent above year-ago levels, suggesting demand remains sluggish. 'It was a timely reminder that the U.S. economy is still very weak,' said David Moore, commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. 'The market had started to price in a V-shaped recovery in the world, and it's likely to be more gradual.' Other signs Wednesday also suggested investor optimism may have outrun economic reality. A Commerce Department report showed a smaller-than-expected rise in factory orders. And the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said the services sector shrank in May below economists' estimates at the slowest pace since October. Traders will be eyeing key U.S. economic data the next couple days, including Thursday's May retail sales report and Friday's jobs data. Rising optimism of an improving economy may set investors up for disappointment if the recovery is uneven, Moore said. 'We're moving from a situation where 'less bad' data fueled the market's anticipation of recovery to one where markets are coming to expect it, so data becomes 'less good,'' Moore said. Analyst Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in Switzerland, however, said that Wednesday's large fall was not necessarily a sign that the Nymex contract's gains were running out of steam. 'Yesterday's correction is nothing without a confirmation today and WTI (the West Texas Intermediate oil contract) remains for now in an ascending channel,' Jakob said. In other Nymex trading, gasoline for July delivery rose 3.59 cents to $1.9375 a gallon and heating oil gained 3.95 cents to $1.7779 a gallon. Natural gas for July delivery jumped 5.9 cents to $3.825 per 1,000 cubic feet. ------ Associated Press writer Alex Kennedy in Singapore contributed to this report. "
1,"The family of American actor David Carradine has asked the FBI to help investigate his death after his body was found in a hotel closet in Thailand's capital with a rope tied to his neck, wrist and genitals. Carradine's family does not believe he committed suicide and is troubled by conflicting accounts about the circumstances of his death, Mark Geragos, an attorney for brother Keith Carradine, told CNN's Larry King late Friday. 'They want an investigation,' Geragos said. 'I would think that the people in Bangkok would want to support an investigation and allow the FBI to go over there and assist in the investigation so we can get the answers to the questions.' Thai police said Saturday they have not been contacted by the FBI. Police initially said Carradine's body was found 'naked, hanging in a closet,' causing them to suspect he committed suicide, though no suicide note was found. On Friday, however, police said the actor may have died from accidental suffocation or heart failure after revealing that he was found with a rope tied around his neck and penis -- leading to speculation that Carradine may have engaged in a dangerous form of sex play. The results of an autopsy performed Friday in Bangkok were not expected for at least three weeks, said Dr. Nanthana Sirisap, director of Chulalongkorn Hospital's Autopsy Center. Carradine's body was flown out of Bangkok early Saturday on a United Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles via Tokyo, according to local media and an airport official, who refused to be identified because she was not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. Embassy would not confirm those details. Pornthip Rojanasunand, director of Thailand's Central Institute of Forensic Science, said the circumstances under which Carradine died suggest the 72-year-old actor may have been performing auto-erotic asphyxiation. The practice involves temporarily cutting off the supply of oxygen to the brain to heighten the effects of a sexual climax. 'In some cases it can suggest murder, too. But sometimes when the victim is naked and in bondage, it can suggest that the victim is doing it to himself,' said Pornthip, considered the country's top criminal forensics expert. She did not take part in the autopsy. 'If you hang yourself by the neck, you don't need so much pressure to kill yourself,' she said. 'Those who get highly sexually aroused tend to forget this fact.' Carradine's body was discovered Thursday morning in his luxury suite by a chambermaid at Bangkok's Swissotel Nai Lert Park Hotel, said its general manager, Aurelio Giraudo. Carradine flew to Thailand last week and began work on a film titled 'Stretch' two days before his death. His friends and associates insisted he would not have killed himself, telling CNN's King he had a happy marriage, recently bought a new car, and had several films lined up after he finished work in Bangkok. Carradine, a martial arts practitioner himself, was best known for the U.S. TV series 'Kung Fu,' which aired from 1972-75. He played Kwai Chang Caine, an orphan who was raised by Shaolin monks and fled China after killing the emperor's nephew in retaliation for the murder of his kung fu master. Carradine also appeared in more than 100 feature films with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Ingmar Bergman and Hal Ashby. He returned to the top in recent years as the title character in Quentin Tarantino's two-part saga 'Kill Bill.' Bill, the worldly father figure of a pack of crack assassins, was a shadowy presence in 2003's 'Kill Bill -- Vol. 1.' In that film, one of Bill's former assassins (Uma Thurman) begins a vengeful rampage against her old associates, including Bill. "
1,"The same day Nevada Republican Sharron Angle announced her candidacy for Harry Reid's Senate seat in 2009, she agreed with a conservative radio host who claimed that there are 'domestic enemies' and 'homegrown enemies' in Congress. That's right: The GOP candidate in what is arguably the highest-profile Senate race in the country said 'Yes, I think you're right,' to the suggestion that there are enemies of our country within the 'walls of the Senate and the Congress.' Angle has been asked about this at least three times, and each time she has refused to change her position. On Monday, when ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked whether she stood by the claim, she replied: 'Certainly people who pass these kinds of policies _ Obamacare, cap and trade, stimulus, bailout _ they're certainly not friends to the free-market system.' Karl: 'So, what are they?' Angle: 'They're not friends.' This isn't complicated. All Angle has to say is: No, of course I don't believe there are domestic enemies in Congress. Given some of Angle's other statements, particularly her suggestion that people may resort to 'Second Amendment remedies' if Congress continues on its current course, it seems possible that she may well believe there are 'domestic enemies' in Congress. If a high-profile Democratic Senate candidate agreed with a lefty host's claim that conservatives within Congress constitute 'domestic enemies' _ and then repeatedly refused to disavow the claim when given the chance _ it would be picked up by scores of major media outlets and hammered at ceaselessly until the claim was retracted. But Angle is mostly getting a pass. Have journalists decided that Angle's eccentric comments have raised the bar so high this latest is no longer worthy of attention? In any event, is there a good reason to let something like this slide? Excerpts from Greg Sargent's blog on domestic politics and debate on the Hill: voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line "
1,"The Vatican spokesman says the Catholic Church, hit by a clerical sex abuse scandal, is capable of recognizing its wounds and healing. The Rev. Federico Lombardi said a recent meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and abuse victims in Malta brought the victims new hope. Lombardi told Vatican Radio on Saturday that the meeting came in the context of an alive, dynamic church that is 'capable of recognizing its wounds sincerely but also of obtaining the grace of healing.' Several bishops have resigned over the past weeks, mostly under the weight of accusations that they shielded abusive priests. On Friday, Belgium's longest-serving bishop resigned, expressing sorrow for having sexually abused a boy both as a priest and after becoming bishop. "
1,"The U.N. peacekeeping chief says it's time for the international community to take 'concrete steps' to allow Afghans to take charge of their future -- and to ensure that 'Afghanization' becomes more than a slogan. Alain Le Roy told the Security Council on Thursday that the Afghan government is 'legitimately eager' to lead and the international community risks failure in its goals for the country if this doesn't happen. He said Afghan 'ownership' must take place on both the military and civilian side, with the international community in support. Afghanistan's U.N. Ambassador Zahir Tanin told the council the government has taken up the leadership challenge and in the coming year its priority will be 'Afghanization' in every area. "
1,"CVS Caremark Corp., the largest provider of prescription drugs, said Wednesday that Chief Executive Officer Thomas Ryan will retire in 2011, four years after overseeing the company's biggest takeover. The company said it anticipates Larry Merlo, 54, will take over when Ryan steps down next May. Merlo has worked with CVS for 20 years, most recently as head of pharmacy retail operations, the chain said in a statement today. The board has appointed him president and chief operating officer, CVS said. Ryan is handing over the reins as competition intensifies with Wal-Mart Stores in retail and with Medco Health Solutions in pharmacy-benefit management services, added with the 2007 acquisition of Caremark. In the past year, CVS has lost PBM contracts and come under investigation over its business practices. Merlo's task will be to ensure the PBM and retail units work together to boost profit, said Helene Wolk, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. 'The challenge will be fully carrying on the vision, which is not to develop just the value of retail, or to restore the PBM to some functionality, but rather to create value through the combination of the two,' said Wolk The chain's more than 7,000 retail pharmacies continue to be the core of the company, said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. in Rye, N.Y. 'The retail side where Larry Merlo comes from has always been best in class,' Jonas said. CVS's retail pharmacies and the pharmacy-benefit management business, run by Per Lofberg since January, each account for about half of the company's revenue. The company acquired Caremark in 2007 for about $27 billion. The PBM unit negotiates drug prices with manufacturers for corporate and government customers. CVS said this month its business practices are under investigation by 24 states. That's similar to a probe started by the Federal Trade Commission last year. CVS said it's cooperating with the investigations. Connecticut is part of a task force reviewing the relationship and practices of CVS and Caremark following their merger, Richard Blumenthal, the state's attorney general, said in March. CVS said it formed an office of the chairman, consisting of Ryan, Merlo and Lofberg, to help with the management transition. 'Larry was the key driver behind the Caremark merger and is working closely with Per to bring that into the retail business,' Ryan said at the company's annual meeting Wednesday. The CEO has spent 36 years at CVS, including 16 as president. With assistance from Julie Alnwick in New York. "
1,"Honduran President Manuel Zelaya had been asleep for just over an hour when he was awakened by shouts, screams and hammering against the door of his residence. Looking out the window, he saw heavily armed soldiers subdue his guards and ran downstairs in his nightclothes. Then, the soldiers broke down the front door. Zelaya told the story of his overthrow Tuesday to sympathetic diplomats at the U.N. General Assembly who minutes earlier had voted by acclamation to demand his immediate restoration. 'I ran downstairs ... and sought to hide from the bullets that I could hear being fired,' Zelaya said, recalling how the military coup unfolded just after 5 a.m. Sunday in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa. Zelaya said he tried to call journalists to tell the world what has happening. 'I could hear rifle shots, and then once the hinges on the door gave way, and they entered, I still had my mobile phone in my hand,' he said. At least eight soldiers pointed their rifles at him. 'And I was told: 'Drop that mobile phone or we will shoot. This is a military order. Drop the phone. Drop it or we will shoot. Drop the phone,'' Zelaya said. 'And I said, `if you have been ordered to shoot me then shoot me. I will not stand in your way. If that is your order ... shoot me. Do not make me suffer any longer, just do it.' The soldiers snatched the phone from his hand. Then, they 'pushed me out into the street jostling me,' Zelaya said. 'They grabbed my arms and said we're taking you away. I was put into a vehicle, and then 15 minutes later I was on board an airplane, and 45 minutes after that I was in Costa Rica.' He said he could not talk about his 21-year-old daughter, who lived with him in the residence, 'because I choke up with rage and pain.' Zelaya paused, his voice breaking, as the diplomats burst into applause. On Monday, Zelaya told Latin American presidents gathered in Nicarauga that his daughter had hidden under her bed for 35 minutes. Once in Costa Rica, he said, 'they opened the door of the airplane and I was dumped at the airport in Costa Rica, still wearing my nightclothes.' Zelaya said Costa Rican President Oscar Arias met him personally at the airport. "
1,"Police say the Cheltenham Gold Cup, one of the most famous trophies in English horse racing, has been stolen. Police say the trophy was taken early Wednesday from a house in Wormington in Gloucestershire county in southwest England. The Gold Cup race, regarded as a highlight of the English jump racing season, is run at the Cheltenham Festival each March. Police say it was one of a number of trophies stolen, with a combined value estimated at more than 150,000 pounds ($228,000). The Cheltenham Gold Cup, first run in 1924, was won this year by Imperial Commander, ridden by Paddy Brennan. "
1,"The entrepreneur who created a virtual marketplace that connects sellers and buyers worldwide is launching an online news site where people will pay to exchange ideas and discuss issues affecting their communities. Pierre Omidyar, the founder and chairman of eBay Inc., is entering the news business with a new online service in Hawaii. By charging a $19.99-a-month membership, Omidyar hopes to accomplish what newspapers and other media organizations nationwide have long struggled with -- having readers pay for content and making local news profitable. 'It's really critical to help find a new way to do journalism that connects with ordinary citizens in a better way,' Omidyar said in an interview Tuesday. 'I think that is what's been lacking. Because the industry has been preoccupied with its own decline, it hasn't had the opportunity to reinvent itself. 'As a new startup, we have the opportunity to reinvent that and bring journalism back into the center of conversation.' Civilbeat.com is expected to go live Wednesday with the official launch scheduled for May 4. It promises to provide in-depth reporting and analysis, and be a civic plaza for island residents. 'Reporter-hosts' will post articles, interact with readers, provide frequent updates and host discussions. 'Journalism plays a central role in the way democracy works, especially in this country. And our democracy doesn't work when journalism doesn't work,' Omidyar said. 'As I saw the decline in the industry, I really became concerned especially with our local communities not just here in Hawaii, but nationwide.' Omidyar decided more than two years ago to launch a news service to cover local civic affairs, including the state, city, education, land and money. 'It's very important for me that we demonstrate that we can do this sustainably,' he said. The site will feature a 'topic page' for each issue. On the page, readers can find links to stories, history and background information. The other unique aspect will be the discussion section. Unlike traditional newspaper online comment sections that are often marred by hateful, obscene, racist or mindless commentary posted by anonymous readers, Civil Beat members will be identified and no anonymous comments will be allowed. 'We'll have a billing relationship with them and so we know who they are,' Omidyar said. Gerald Kato, chair at the University of Hawaii School of Communications, said newspaper subscribers are coveted because they are considered to be older, wealthier and better educated. But many have been turned off by what Kato describes as 'crazies,' who participate in unmoderated comment sections. 'They're trying to flip that around. They want all these high-end people that would gravitate toward a newspaper, but want to filter out all the crazies,' Kato said. 'The filtering mechanism would be, you pay to play.' Omidyar said he's hoping to encourage a 'higher level of conversation.' 'I think the quality of conversation is going to be something which really creates a sense of value for people,' he said, especially for people who are concerned about issues in their community and want meaningful discussions and debate. The unassuming Honolulu billionaire who wears blue jeans and flip-flops to work is bankrolling the operation, but declined to say how much he's invested so far. He's rented out a spacious, 4,000-square-foot (372-square-meter) office located a few miles (kilometers) outside east of downtown Honolulu and hired about a dozen people. The editor is veteran newspaperman John Temple, who served as editor, president and publisher of the Rocky Mountain News, which ceased publication in February 2009. Omidyar points out that unlike a newspaper, he has no printing presses, trucks, sales staff or other 'legacy' obligations. He said having a membership payment provides instant feedback from the readers. He called traditional news organizations 'advertising based,' with publishers answering to advertisers instead of the community. 'I think having a more direct business model will help us and I think it's going to be part of the future for the industry as well,' he said. Omidyar said he's focused on Hawaii, where he lives, and not really looking to expand to other areas. 'In my wildest dreams, if we are very successful here, would we consider expanding to other regions? Sure. But are we spending any time thinking of that today? No. We're not,' he said. 'It's 100 percent Hawaii and we've got to make it work here.' Kato said Omidyar will need to produce a high-quality product to motivate people to pay the monthly fee. 'It's not a matter of if you build it, they will come. You got to have some reason to come,' he said. While having people ante $20 a month will be challenging, Kato isn't willing to bet against Omidyar. 'Who would've thought eBay would work? It's been wildly successful,' Kato said. 'Finding people who would pay $20 a month to participate in an online forum, especially in this economy, I don't know. I wish him luck.' "

1,"Attorneys for the Armenian church have filed a lawsuit against the J. Paul Getty Museum, demanding the return of seven pages ripped from the Armenian Bible. The Armenian Apostolic Church of America filed the lawsuit this week in Los Angeles. The illustrated pages by T'oros Roslin date to 1256 and were acquired by the Los Angeles-based museum from a private collector in 1994. Getty spokeswoman Julie Jaskol says the museum legally owns the papers it calls the Canon Tables, and they have been widely published, studied and exhibited. Michael Bazyler, a member of the plaintiff's legal team, says the church believes the papers were stolen by someone after Ottoman Turks began mass killings of Armenians in 1915. The rest of the handwritten Armenian Bible is at a museum in Armenia. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Hope has turned to doubt and disenchantment for almost half of President Barack Obama's supporters. More than 4 of 10 likely voters who say they once considered themselves Obama backers now are either less supportive or say they no longer support him at all, according to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted Oct. 7-10. Three weeks before the Nov. 2 congressional elections that Republicans are trying to make a referendum on Obama, fewer than half of likely voters approve of the president's job performance. Likely voters are more apt to say Obama's policies have harmed rather than helped the economy. Among those who say they are most enthusiastic about voting this year, 6 of 10 say the Democrat has damaged the economy. 'He's made compromises that have hurt the middle class,' says poll respondent Alan Graham, 55, a surgeon in London, Ky., who supported Obama in 2008 and now is on the fence about the president. 'I think the lobbyists for the big businesses are having their way with him.' A year after the official end of the recession, growth has slowed again without big gains in employment. Joblessness, which was 9.6 percent in September, has barely budged since reaching a 26-year high of 10.1 percent last October. Gross domestic product has slowed from a 5.0 percent annual growth rate in last year's final quarter to 1.7 percent during the second quarter. While stocks have risen since Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009, the gains largely came during his first year. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up more than 44 percent since Obama was inaugurated, though only 4.5 percent this year. Obama responded to the financial crisis he inherited by embracing the Bush administration's $700 billion bank bailout, as well as a taxpayer-financed rescue of the auto industry, and providing a $814 billion economic stimulus program and the biggest overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression. The poll shows that almost two-thirds of voters believe the country is on the wrong track and unemployment is the top concern for about half the electorate. The budget deficit, which was $1.291 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and $1.416 trillion for 2009, ranks as the second most pressing issue, cited by 27 percent. Obama's deteriorating job-approval numbers are balanced by continuing regard for him personally: 53 percent of voters have a positive view of the president in the October poll, up from 49 percent in a July survey. In a hypothetical presidential match-up against one of the Republican Party's most prominent figures, Obama beats former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin 51 percent to 35 percent. Former President George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress still get more blame than Obama or congressional Democrats for the condition of the economy. The White House is trying to tap this current of public opinion with a campaign theme portraying a vote for Republicans as a move 'backward' on the economy. Two-thirds of likely voters say Bush hurt the economy and 57 percent say congressional Republicans have. Forty-seven percent say Obama's policies have damaged the economy and 53 percent say congressional Democrats have done so. While some prominent corporate leaders have complained Obama is too anti- business, most voters don't share that concern. More than half believe Obama has struck the right balance or is too pro-business. Only 36 percent of voters consider the president anti-business. By contrast, in a September poll of Bloomberg subscribers who are investors, analysts or traders, more than three-quarters of U.S. respondents said the president is anti-business. Obama also outdoes Republicans in the debate over renewing the Bush-era tax cuts that expire Dec. 31. A 43 percent plurality of likely voters support Obama's plan to allow the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest to expire. In the investor poll, two-thirds favored continuing the tax cuts for all, including families making more than $250,000. On Obama's main foreign-policy initiative, 6 of 10 voters say Afghanistan is now a lost cause, up from 55 percent in July. 'It's worse than a dead end, and he doesn't seem to recognize that,' says poll respondent Nick Ruffin, 66, an asset manager in McLean, Va. The erosion of backing for Obama among onetime supporters has been most notable among two groups of voters who were central to his election: women and independents. More than 6 of 10 of the former Obama backers who have turned away from him are women; 53 percent of the onetime supporters are independents. 'I understand it's an uphill battle, but I don't think things are that much better than when he was elected,' says poll respondent Daphne Feeney, 28, an Army wife and stay-at-home mother in Seaside, Calif., who voted for Obama and now says she is ambivalent about the president. The disaffection of the former Obama supporters doesn't necessarily translate into an embrace of Republicans or tea party candidates, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Des Moines, Iowa-based Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. In the hypothetical contest with Palin, the former Obama supporters favor the president more than two-to-one. 'I hear people talk about this all the time,' Selzer says. 'The excitement they once felt is gone and they are left wondering if they were sold a bag of goods.' This doesn't mean Democrats have lost these onetime supporters, she said, though 'they are certainly skeptical' of that party. 'This is what makes this election so volatile.' Though the disaffected Obama supporters give him low marks on his performance in office with 39 percent job approval, compared with 47 percent among all voters, they are just as likely to view him favorably personally. Obama is outshined among all voters by two close members of his entourage: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is viewed favorably by 64 percent, and First Lady Michelle Obama, viewed favorably by 62 percent. The survey of 721 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. "
1,"English newcomer John Parry shot a 5-under 67 to take a one-shot halfway lead at the Austrian Open. The 23-year-old graduate of the European Challenge Tour in 2009 produced a bogey-free second round at the Diamond Country Club which took him to 8 under after a first-day 69. Parry has not held the lead on the European Tour since February, when he shot two straight 67s at the Avantha Masters in India, only to finish in 26th place. Parry is 117th on the money list and a top-ten finish on Sunday will earn him his 2011 tour card. 'I hit 17 greens in regulation,' Parry said. 'And hit the ball really solid. And if I can keep it going like that I should be there or there abouts on Sunday night.' The chasing pack includes European Ryder Cup player Graeme McDowell, who shot a 68 for a share of second place alongside Sweden's Pelle Edberg and Jose Manuel Lara of Spain. McDowell, who returned to competition after five weeks off following his victory at the US Open, opened the tournament with a 69. 'The rust has gone. It took me approximately eight holes on the first day to shake it off,' McDowell said. 'But today I was more solid and it's nice to be in contention again going into the weekend. 'And it really feels nice to be in contention going into the weekend. I have come back refreshed and I fell a lot better this week.' Miguel Angel Jimenez, the other Ryder Cup player in the field, moved to 3-under after a 68. Goerge Coetzee, who held a one-shot lead after his first-round 65, had threatened to break away from the field. A run of four straight birdies from 7th took him three clear of his nearest rivals before the 24-year-old Pretoria native encountered a rough patch. A double bogey at the 12 reined him back before a quadruple 8 at the 16th, where he found water twice, saw him plummet down the leaderboard. After a visit to another lake in front of the 17th green Coetzee shot a four-over 76 leaving him at 3-under and five shots behind the leader. "
1,"The midterm elections focused almost exclusively on domestic issues. But Tuesday's outcome may complicate President Barack Obama's foreign-policy goals, with Republicans using their new strength to cut aid to other countries and question the president's policies toward countries such as Syria, Venezuela and Israel, officials and analysts said. The Republican capture of the House means that Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a feisty Cuban American conservative, will probably take command of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, replacing Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who had been largely sympathetic to Obama's agenda. Ros-Lehtinen is expected to 'bring additional scrutiny to some issues that wasn't taking place before,' said one GOP congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the congresswoman has not yet been formally appointed. Ros-Lehtinen is a strong supporter of Israel. She is likely to grill administration officials on their policies toward North Korea and Syria and to focus attention on the influence of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Latin America. She also has been a strong proponent of withholding contributions from the United Nations to force reform of that organization. Although the Senate stayed in Democratic hands, it will probably be even harder for Obama to win ratification of treaties, a process that requires 67 votes. The White House is hoping the Senate will use the lame-duck session to approve one of Obama's main foreign-policy accomplishments, a nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Russia. Democrats will control at least 58 seats until January, when the number could drop as low as 52. Administration officials acknowledge that it will be harder to pass START if the vote slips to next year. But they are banking on striking a deal with Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who has influence with many Republicans. Kyl's main demand has been guarantees for a multibillion-dollar program to modernize American nuclear- weapons labs. 'If we're able to satisfy those [concerns], which we're working to do, that opens a pathway forward, whether it's with this set of Republicans or the next,' said one senior U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. The biggest losers in the midterm elections were moderate Democrats who were the staunchest backers of the administration's Afghanistan policy. Their defeat will yield a Democratic caucus that is significantly more antiwar. The Obama administration will, in turn, probably be forced to depend more heavily on Republicans, who have generally backed the overall strategy in Afghanistan. 'The level of inconvenience may go up for the Obama administration, but I don't think it will be likely to force a policy change,' said Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. If the Afghan war is still widely viewed as going poorly next year, though, it is possible that some conservative Republicans could break with their party. 'There is a libertarian streak that is starting to emerge in the Republican party . . . that has called for significant reductions in defense spending,' said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a defense think tank. The Democratic party losses, however, could have a much bigger impact on Defense Secretary Robert Gates's push to pare waste from the defense budget. Several moderate Democrats who were respected voices on defense policy, such as Rep. Ike Skelton, Mo., and Rep. John Spratt, S.C., lost their seats Tuesday. Their support probably would have given Gates's efficiency efforts a major boost inside the Democratic Party. The uncertain political environment will also make it harder for new lawmakers from either party to support cuts to the defense budget that could cost jobs, analysts said. Lee Hamilton, the former congressman who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said Obama might have an easier time getting funding for the war in Afghanistan from a Congress in which Republicans were more dominant. But 'funding for foreign affairs in general, the State Department, development aid, will probably be tighter,' he said. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, who is known for her bipartisan efforts, is expected to become the head of the Appropriations panel that doles out foreign aid. But when it comes to spending, 'you're going to have a lot of orders coming down from a higher pay grade' in the party, said one congressional staffer, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Several analysts said the Republican victories would bode well for passage of pending free-trade treaties with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the conventional wisdom could be wrong in this case. 'It's not clear that will be the case, given that some of the Republicans who won are not traditionalists and also because of the economic context - the high unemployment and slow growth,' he said. "
1,"Want to talk more? Keep pedaling, says Nokia. The world's largest mobile phone maker on Thursday launched four low-priced handsets and a recharger that can be connected to a bicycle's dynamo which charges when the wheels turn. The bicycle charger kit and handsets -- some with a standby battery time of up to six weeks, FM radio and flashlights -- are aimed at users with limited access to electricity. The new devices will be available during the second half of the year, priced at between euro30 and euro45 ($36-$55). The bike kit has a charger, dynamo and a holder to secure the phone to the bicycle. The dynamo -- a small electrical generator -- uses the movement of the wheels to charge the handset through a standard 2mm charging jack used in most Nokia handsets. It cuts off at speeds lower than 3 mph (5 kph) and higher than 30 kph (50 kph). The price of the kit in emerging markets starts at euro15 ($18), and likely will cost more in other markets, Nokia said. The cheapest of the new handsets -- the Nokia C series -- is the C1-00, expected to retail for around euro30 ($36). It is also the firm's first model with a 2-in-1 double SIM card solution. 'By simply holding down a key people are able to switch between SIM cards,' vice president Alex Lambeek said. 'This enables them to take advantage of reduced call rates, flexibility when traveling from one country to another or helps with sharing a phone within a family and still use their own SIM card.' The C1 has a standby battery time of up to six weeks and features a flashlight and radio, both aimed at regions where electricity is scarce. The Nokia C2, with an expected price tag of euro45 ($55), has dual SIM standby capability that keeps both SIM cards active, meaning that calls and text messages can come to either number while the handset is on. One of the cards sit under the battery while the other SIM card is removable without turning off the phone. The C2 also has the possibility of storing micro-SD cards with 32 gigabytes of memory for music, photos and other data. Nokia has recently been faced by strong competition in the high-end smart phone market, particularly from RIM's Blackberry, Apple's iPhone and Google's Android, but has maintained its leading global position. In another strong move to grab new customers in emerging markets it launched three less-expensive smart phones in April, including its first model expected to sell for under euro100 ($125). Nokia has been the top handset maker since 1998. Last year, it sold 432 million handsets. It is based in Espoo, near Helsinki, and employs around 126,000 people worldwide. -------- Online: "
1,"There's a reason films like 'Ran' get 25th-anniversary rereleases. It's because there aren't a heck of a lot of them. Based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and set in 16th-century feudal Japan, Akira Kurosawa's 1985 antiwar epic is almost over the top with betrayal, battle and blood. At times, the red stuff flows like paint from the brush of Jackson Pollock. It's an angry and expressive spurt of pigment, emblematic of the director's rage _ the title is the Japanese character for 'chaos' or 'fury' _ and not a realistic body fluid. Filmgoers raised on contemporary special effects might balk at all the fake- looking gore, along with the Noh-style old-age makeup of the main character, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), whose actions set the story in motion. But the drama itself packs a powerful _ and timeless _ gut punch. As in 'Lear,' Hidetora has decided to divide his kingdom among his three children, except here they're sons instead of daughters. The eldest two, Taro (Akira Terao) and Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), flatter their father, while the youngest, Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), calls the old man a fool for thinking that Taro and Jiro won't quickly turn their backs on their father. Saburo, like Shakespeare's Cordelia, is banished for his blunt talk. Of course, Taro and Jiro almost immediately let Hidetora down. It is at this point that Kurosawa goes well beyond his source material, adding a treacherous female character in the form of Taro's wife, Kaede (Mieko Harada). Like Lady Macbeth, she's the real instigator of Taro and Jiro's perfidy, and her presence lends the film a Grand Guignol flair. At one point she demands the head of her sister-in-law after her own husband is killed and she has seduced Jiro. It's wild, compulsively watchable stuff. But Kurosawa doesn't care just about 'how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.' Over the course of the film's nearly three-hour length, Hidetora is shown to be something of a war criminal himself. He didn't just inherit his kingdom but shed 50 years' worth of his neighbors' blood to get it and keep it. His betrayal by his sons makes him a tragic figure, but so does the blood on his own hands. By the time Kurosawa's camera comes to rest on the film's final, poignant image, a painting of the Buddha that one character had promised another would protect him from harm, the movie seemingly has accomplished the impossible: one-upping Shakespeare. R. Contains lots of blood and violence, and brief sensuality. In Japanese with English subtitles. 162 minutes. "
1,"A 50-year-old woman with life-threatening cancer became the third Australian with swine flu to die on Wednesday, as Indonesia and Cambodia reported their first confirmed cases. The Australian fatality is the fourth swine flu-related death in the Asia-Pacific region. The Philippines reported a patient with the virus died on Monday. The Australian woman was admitted to a Melbourne hospital on Saturday with respiratory illness and died Wednesday, a day after testing positive for swine flu, Victoria state Health Minister Daniel Andrews said. Authorities are not certain whether any of the three swine flu-related deaths in Australia were directly caused by the virus because all of them had other serious illnesses. 'We know that for immunosuppressed people, especially those who are being treated for life-threatening cancers, any respiratory illness can seriously compromise their health,' said senior health official Rosemary Lester. Australian confirmed 2,873 swine flu cases as of Wednesday, an increase of 140 in a day. Medical advocates have urged the government to make efforts to protect Aborigines, who often live in unhygienic townships with limited medical services, making them especially vulnerable. The Northern Territory, which has the country's highest proportion of Aborigines, reported the nation's highest swine flu infection rate per capita -- 35 cases per 100,000 people. Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon said Tuesday that authorities were taking steps to ensure that indigenous communities had adequate supplies of antiviral medication. Australia's nearest Asian neighbor, Indonesia, announced its first swine flu infections Wednesday. A British woman and an Indonesian pilot who had been abroad were recovering after being admitted to hospitals with fever and flu-like symptoms. Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said the patients have been isolated and that 'the disease has not yet spread in Indonesia.' But she warned it could become more deadly if it were to mutate with bird flu, which is endemic in national poultry flocks. Indonesia was hardest hit by bird flu, with 119 human deaths since it first struck in 2003. The vast majority of bird flu infections have been fatal. The Philippines, meanwhile, reported 131 new swine flu cases Wednesday in the largest single-day jump in infections in the country, bringing total cases to 604. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said a number of 'low-level' community outbreaks had been reported in some parts of the capital, metropolitan Manila. The newly infected include 14 foreigners, Duque said. Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her 30-member entourage, including at least six Cabinet members, will voluntarily go into quarantine for several days when they return home Friday from a 10-day foreign trip to four countries, including the United States, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said Wednesday. Thailand announced 86 new cases of swine flu, bringing the country's total to 985, the health ministry said. Public Health Minister Withaya Kaewparadai said Wednesday most patients had fully recovered and only 15 remained hospitalized. None was in critical condition. The ministry earlier said the flu had been found at dozens of schools and universities since the country's first case was confirmed in late April, prompting authorities to temporarily close them for disinfecting. Hong Kong confirmed 36 more cases of swine flu Wednesday, bringing the city's total to 444, the Department of Health said in a statement. There have been no reports of deaths in the territory. Cambodia's health minister announced the country's first case of swine flu. Mam Bun Heng said the 16-year-old American girl came to Cambodia as part of a student group on June 19 and developed flu symptoms the following day. In neighboring Laos, the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology confirmed the third case of swine flu in the country, reported the Vientiane Times newspaper. In Bangladesh, six people who recently returned from trips to the United States tested positive for swine flu, government doctor Mahmudur Rahman said. They are in addition to the country's first case, which was detected last Friday. The World Health Organization has declared swine flu a pandemic. As of Monday, it said more than 52,000 cases had been reported worldwide with 231 deaths, mostly in Mexico and the United States. "
1,"The U.S. Senate was poised to approve a nuclear arms pact with Russia on Wednesday, handing President Barack Obama a huge victory on his top foreign policy priority. Passage of the New START treaty appeared assured after 11 Republicans joined Democrats in a 67-28 procedural vote Tuesday to end debate on the pact. That signaled that Obama should have the two-thirds majority he needs when the Senate votes on final approval of the treaty Wednesday. Its ratification would mark a big comeback for Obama's arm controls efforts after the treaty appeared all but dead just weeks ago. It also would allow Obama to continue efforts to improve relations with Russia. Ratification would mark a third recent major political victory for Obama, even though his Democratic party was trounced in last month's congressional elections. In recent days, he won passage of a bipartisan tax deal and a vote ending the 17-year-old ban on gays openly serving in the military, a crucial issue with the party's liberal base. 'We are on the brink of writing the next chapter in the 40-year history of wrestling with the threat of nuclear weapons,' Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, a Democrat, said after the vote. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the New START accord in April. It would limit each country's strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550, down from the current ceiling of 2,200. It would also establish a system for monitoring and verification. U.S. weapons inspections ended a year ago with the expiration of a 1991 treaty. 'START' stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The administration was adamant that it be ratified this year because the Democrats' majority in the Senate is set to shrink by five in January and waiting could have meant months of delay or defeat. Republicans accused Democrats of rushing approval of the treaty for political reasons. They have asserted it would limit U.S. missile defense options and argued that it has insufficient procedures to verify Russia's adherence. When Sen. Jon Kyl, the leading Republican on negotiations over the treaty, suggested a delay last month, Obama appeared unlikely to find the nine Republican votes needed for passage. But he and top members of his administration lobbied intensely, with Obama postponing his Christmas vacation in Hawaii. Obama has insisted the treaty is a national security imperative that will improve cooperation with Russia, an argument loudly echoed by the nation's military and foreign policy leaders, former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and six Republican secretaries of state. In a fresh appeal for ratification, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday that the treaty would 'strengthen our leadership role in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and provide the necessary flexibility to structure our strategic nuclear forces to best meet national security interests.' Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made a rare visit to the Capitol Tuesday to lobby lawmakers. In the end, they persuaded enough Republicans to defy the party's top two leaders in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his deputy Kyl, and support the pact. 'We know when we've been beaten,' Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch told reporters hours before Tuesday's vote. Even the Senate's No. 3 Republican, Lamar Alexander, endorsed the accord, saying he was assured U.S. defenses would not be weakened. The treaty will leave the United States 'with enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come,' Alexander said on the Senate floor. Republicans had tried to kill the treaty by forcing changes in its language that would have sent it back for negotiations with Moscow. Democrats were working to appease some Republican senators by letting them raise these issues in legislation accompanying the treaty that would not directly affect the treaty. Most Republicans remained opposed. 'The administration did not negotiate a good treaty,' said Kyl, the Senate's No. 2 Republican leader. 'They went into the negotiations it seems to me with the attitude with the Russians just like the guy who goes into the car dealership and says, `I'm not leaving here until I buy a car.'' Though Kyl looks likely to vote on the losing side of the debate over the treaty, in his negotiations with the administration he did win Obama's commitment to modernize the remaining U.S. nuclear arsenal with projected spending of $85 billion over 10 years. Some of that money is now in the pipeline, contained in a stopgap government funding bill that cleared Congress on Tuesday. The measure would finance the government, mostly at current levels, through March 4. It makes an exception for nuclear security programs, allowing the government to spend money to modernize the United States' nuclear arsenal at a rate equal to Obama's $624 million request. "
1,"Rival parties in Ivory Coast traded accusations of voter intimidation, violence and fraud on Monday, as the world's leading cocoa producer awaited results from the country's first presidential election in a decade. Electoral commission spokesman Yves Tadet said the first preliminary results would be announced later Monday. There were no reports of major violence by Monday afternoon. Vote counts were being tabulated from polling stations nationwide, which completed their vote counts Sunday night and began sending them to the commission's headquarters in the main city, Abidjan. Some results could not be delivered on time, however, because of a 10 p.m. curfew imposed days ago by President Laurent Gbagbo over security concerns. The ballot, delayed for years, is seen as a key step toward reuniting the country eight years after a civil war divided it in two. United Nations envoy Young-jin Choi said three people were killed Sunday during multiple clashes between partisans in the west of the country. Despite these incidents, he said the vote went well overall. 'I have no doubt that the will of the Ivorian people, as it was expressed yesterday, will be respected,' he said Monday. Most of the weekend clashes between political supporters occurred in small villages where there is no police or military presence and locals set up roadblocks to keep outsiders away. Some 1,000 people from several villages fled the violence and sought refuge at the U.N. compound in Sinfra on Sunday, said U.N. mission spokesman Hamadoun Toure. He said the villagers refused to leave because they feared for their lives. Most of them had returned home by Monday afternoon, he said. Voters chose between Gbagbo, who has been in power since violent street protests swept him into power in 2000, and Alassane Ouattara, the man Gbagbo accuses of being behind the rebellion that sought to topple him in 2002. Gbagbo received 38 percent in a first round of voting in October, and Ouattara came second with about 32 percent. Since then, third-place finisher Henri Konan Bedie, who won 25 percent, has thrown his support behind Ouattara. In the downtrodden Abidjan neighborhood of Treichville, Ouattara supporters gathered outside of polling stations after dark Sunday, saying that they wouldn't let soldiers remove the ballot boxes for fear that they would be tampered with. Police fired their automatic weapons in the air to disperse the crowd, said local resident Lucie Adope. 'No one was hurt, but the crowd didn't go home until the U.N. came to get the ballot boxes,' she said. Interior Ministry official Auguste Zoguehi announced on state television late Sunday that two people were killed on polling day -- one soldier and one civilian -- in the town of Niouboua, in the west. He went on to list a dozen other incidents including one where armed men arrived at polling stations outside the city of Bouafle and made off with the ballot boxes. His claims, however, were refuted by the prime minister in a statement released late Sunday. Gbagbo's campaign director Pascal Affi N'Guessan claimed five soldiers and police officers were killed in scuffles outside of a polling station in Daloa, also in the west of the country. His claims were denied by gendarmes contacted in Daloa for confirmation. The opposition also leveled accusations of voter intimidation, kidnapping and violence. In Sinfra, a town not far from Niouboua, skirmishes between partisans led to six deaths, said local Ouattara campaign director Zoua Boti Bi. Three of their party officials were kidnapped by unidentified armed men, he said. Despite multiple inquiries with both international and domestic authorities, none of the incidents could be independently confirmed by The Associated Press. A curfew went into effect for the second consecutive night at 10 p.m. Sunday, and the country was mostly calm. But confusion and suspicions rose after the electoral commission, which had promised to release partial results the night of the vote, canceled its announcement. While voting for the most part took place peacefully, recent violence has stoked fears the situation could degenerate if the results aren't accepted by both sides. Rebels in the northern half of the country still haven't disarmed and militias in the west remain dangerous, according to a recent report by New York-based Human Rights Watch. Electoral Commission vice president Mamadou Soumahoro said turnout was about 70 percent. He said some incidents of violence 'were reported here and there. But they were quickly brought under control.' "
1,Gokdeniz Karadeniz's 73rd-minute winner gave Rubin Kazan a surprising 2-1 victory at Barcelona in the Champions League. Alejandro Dominguez put Karadeniz through into the area and he beat Victor Valdes with an angled shot that silenced the Camp Nou crowd. Aleksandr Ryazantsev put the Russian champions ahead after just 75 seconds by running onto a loose ball to rocket a shot beyond Valdes inside the top of goal. Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi had penalty appeals waived away before Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalized for the Spanish champions in the 48th. Yaya Toure's header hit the post in the fourth minute of injury time. Rubin and Barcelona both have four points from three games in Group F. 
1,"The leaders whose slates won the most votes in Iraq's disputed parliamentary elections should set aside personal ambition and contemplate accepting positions other than the premiership, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East said Tuesday. 'Iraqi leaders now are spending a lot of time debating who gets to go first trying to form a government,' Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman said in an interview. 'I would argue it's more important to be talking about what the programs of the new government are going to be.' Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Ayad Allawi, leader of the Sunni- backed Iraqiya faction, both claim the right to form the next government, citing conflicting interpretations of the constitution. Iraqiya won the most seats, 91, besting Maliki's State of Law coalition by two. Maliki has reached a tentative deal with a rival Shiite bloc that he contends entitles the alliance to form a government. The dispute is worrisome to U.S. officials because the stalemate could drag on for months, potentially paralyzing government functions and raising political tension as the U.S. troop drawdown accelerates. A government led by Maliki or another member of the Shiite alliance is likely to leave many Sunnis feeling disenfranchised. An Allawi government, which is seen as a more remote possibility, could lead to the reactivation of Shiite militias that in the past have served as armed wings of political parties. 'In the end, there's going to be one prime minister,' Feltman said during a visit to Baghdad. 'People who may feel that they are the legitimate candidate for prime minister are going to have to start thinking of their Plan B.' The United States hailed the March elections as the most credible in the history of the Arab world. But U.S. officials are troubled by a recent spike in violence and the intransigence of Iraqi political leaders. The certification of election results was delayed by a manual recount of votes in Baghdad carried out at Maliki's request and the attempted disqualification of nine candidates _ most of them Sunni or secular _ by a commission run by Shiite politicians. In the end, neither effort changed the seat distribution in the incoming parliament, but the political maneuvering has cast a pall on the legitimacy of the vote. Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief, Prince Turki al-Faisal, criticized Maliki in a speech Saturday, saying he was trying to 'hijack the results of the elections and deny the Iraqi people their legitimately elected government.' Saudi Arabia is among the region's Sunni states that worry about the emergence of an Iraq ruled by Shiite politicians with close ties to Iran. Maliki has rejected such criticism, saying he is committed to forming a government in which no segment is excluded. Falah al-Naqib, an Iraqiya candidate who won a seat in parliament, said Sunnis will be deeply disappointed if Allawi is not the next prime minister. 'Most Iraqis want to see a nonsectarian leader like Dr. Allawi,' he said. "
1,"The head of a Bahraini human rights organization says the government has taken over his group and removed him from his post. Abdullah al-Derazi of the Bahrain Human Rights Society told The Associated Press that the Ministry of Social affairs has frozen the group's activities and will appoint a temporary administrator. In a statement Wednesday, the government said the group was 'only serving one segment of society,' referring to the country's majority Shiites. The move comes as the government has arrested 23 Shiite activists, accusing them of forming a terrorist network and trying to topple the country's Sunni-dominated government. Another 250 were arrested in the crackdown that followed a series of Shiite-led protests over discrimination. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: Mohammed al-Adahi left his wife and children in Yemen in the summer of 2001 for a six-month stay in Afghanistan. Once there, he met twice with Osama bin Laden, stayed at an al-Qaida guesthouse and attended the al-Farouq training camp, where many of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers received military training. Mr. Adahi was picked up by Pakistani authorities in late 2001 on a bus carrying injured Arab and Pakistani fighters. He was later transferred to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he has been held for eight years. In challenging his detention, Mr. Adahi argued that there were innocent explanations for his actions. His sister had married a close associate of Osama bin Laden, who hosted a male-only feast celebrating the arranged marriage. A trial court judge explained that after 'having attended his sister's wedding reception, and with time off from his job ... and having no particular plans about what to do next, he portrayed himself as being willing to explore the region and try something new.' This 'something new' turned out to be training at the notorious al-Qaida camp, which Mr. Adahi says he pursued to 'satisfy his `curiosity' about jihad, and because he found himself in Afghanistan with idle time.' These implausible explanations and the amount of intelligence against Mr. Adahi should have been enough to keep him behind bars. But that is not how Judge Gladys Kessler of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia saw it. Last August, Judge Kessler issued a deeply flawed decision ordering Mr. Adahi's release. The judge evaluated each of Mr. Adahi's acts in isolation, rather than as pieces of a legal 'mosaic.' Using this approach, Judge Kessler concluded that Mr. Adahi's 'admission that he trained at Al-Farouq is not sufficient to carry the Government's burden of showing that he was a part, or substantial supporter, of enemy forces.' While judicial review of Guantanamo detentions is imperative to ensuring justice, this case illustrates the perils of allowing trial judges to assess intelligence information through the lens of conventional rules of evidence. Just as worrisome is a decision handed down this month that went too far in repudiating Judge Kessler's approach. A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit flirted with _ but stopped short of _ allowing the government to meet an even lower standard of proof than the already relaxed standard now commonly required. The judges built on a previous decision of the court to conclude that a stay at a guesthouse or training camp _ no matter the length of stay or context _ offered 'overwhelming' evidence of membership in al- Qaida. The two rulings prove once again the need for clear rules to govern the federal court process for challenging detentions. The Supreme Court, which ruled two years ago that detainees have the right to have their cases heard by federal judges, did not set standards, and Congress and the White House have been shamefully inactive in filling in the gaps. The end result is a kind of Guantanamo roulette, where the predilections of judges shape the rules and determine the outcomes. This serves no one well _ not the detainees, not the government and least of all the rule of law. "
1,"The Republican National Committee filed amended financial reports Tuesday showing about $3 million in debt for April and May that was previously unreported. RNC Treasurer Randy Pullen said in a memo to the party's budget committee that he had discovered unpaid bills for telemarketing, legal consulting and other services. Pullen accused RNC Chairman Michael Steele and his chief of staff of hiding invoices and telling staff to withhold information from Pullen. A political party must report an invoice as a debt to the Federal Election Commission if it's undisputed and remains unpaid for 60 days past the date that the services were rendered. 'The committee will continue to work very closely with our legal counsel and our treasurer to ensure that the RNC meets all FEC reporting requirements, as it has always done in the past,' said RNC spokesman Doug Heye. Heye refuted Pullen's claim that RNC staffers were told not to give him information on the debt. 'I don't know where that comes from,' Heye said. 'Staff is available to any member of the RNC, and we are available to them 24 hours a day.' The committee has also tapped two outside lawyers and an accounting firm to review its policies following earlier revelations about its bookkeeping. The financial reports filed Tuesday night show that the amount of money available for the November elections has been shrinking over the past months, Pullen wrote in his memo, which also warned of other problems. 'It has been clear to me and others at the RNC since early March that fundraising has been falling well short of budgeted numbers,' he wrote. 'In addition, costs of fundraising for major donor and direct marketing have been well above that budgeted going back to last year.' The $3 million debts were paid off in May and June. The RNC reported $10.9 million on hand and $2 million in debt at the end of June. That's a slightly better financial position that the Democratic National Committee, which had $11 million in cash and $3.9 million in debt. The RNC's finances have been a source of controversy recently, after it was reported in March that the party paid a nearly $2,000 tab at a bondage-themed night club, and large donors have directed their contributions elsewhere. 'Failure to disclose debt is a common violation, but the FEC is likely to take this very seriously,' said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer with Arent Fox who has worked for candidates from both parties. 'A failure to report a debt of that magnitude doesn't let the public or the candidates or the opposing party know the true financial state of the committee.' The RNC is likely to face some kind of civil penalty for the amendment, but it should be well below $1 million, Kappel said. Last month, the NRC paid a $10,000 fine after filing inaccurate financial reports, attributing the error to a former treasurer who has been accused of embezzling the committee's money. Steele's former Maryland Senate campaign also filed a report with the Federal Election Commission this month. It showed the campaign had $136 in the bank and $51,000 in debt. -0-< Staff writer Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report. "
1,"BEIJING - World capitals on Wednesday braced for a new political order in Washington, as policymakers and analysts tried to assess the impact on foreign policy of a new Republican-led U.S. House, a diminished Democratic majority in the Senate and an American president many fear has been left weakened. The midterm elections were watched particularly closely in China, which emerged as a villain in campaign ads by candidates railing against American jobs being shipped overseas. Some feared congressional Republicans, more mistrustful of China's intentions, would pressure the Obama administration to take a tougher line with Beijing on such issues as technology exports, cooperation on clean energy projects and Chinese subsidies to state-owned companies that put U.S. firms at a disadvantage. 'It will be harder to build strategic mutual trust in the coming years,' said Sun Zhe, a professor from Tsinghua University's Institute of International Studies. 'China will face a tougher Congress.' On the opposite side, however, other analysts said they viewed Republicans as stronger supporters of free trade, which might mute the Democrats' tendency toward moves viewed as more 'protectionist.' Although concerns over the value of China's currency are bipartisan, some said the election results made an all-out trade war far less likely. 'With more control by Republicans, I think the Obama administration's policy on China will be softened and more rational,' said Su Hao, director of the Strategy and Conflict Management Research Center at China Foreign Affairs University. 'Sino-U.S. relations will stabilized in the future.' In Moscow, there were fears that emboldened Senate Republicans might make a first test of their new clout the pending START treaty limiting nuclear arms. Although Democrats retained control of the Senate, Fyodor Lukyanov, editor in chief of the magazine Russian Global Politics, said it is clear that the Republicans will push for significant concessions from the administration in return for their support for ratifying the treaty. 'The American political situation will become more turbulent and less predictable than before,' he said. 'It looks like American voters are rushing from one side to another. And the domestic political turbulence in the United States will have a huge impact on the world, Russia included.' For decades, going back to the Soviet era, Moscow - much like China - preferred dealing with Republicans in Washington. But after a dramatic worsening of relations during the presidency of George W. Bush, the Kremlin has embraced Obama's 'reset.' 'Mr. Obama is the first American president after the Cold War who was not influenced by Cold War thinking,' said Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Institute for the U.S. and Canadian Studies, a Moscow think tank. But, like Russia, the United States has a large contingent of people who still have a Cold War outlook, he said. 'And the Republicans mainly now represent that part of the population which continues to think in Cold War terms.' In the Middle East, and the wider Islamic world, there were questions about whether a domestically weakened Obama would be able to pursue his stated goal of securing in his first term a long-elusive final peace agreement between Israelis and the Palestinians. There was much pre-election commentary in Israel that Republican gains would make it harder for Obama to pressure Israel into making peace concessions in the peace talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz quoted Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., who is expected to become the House majority leader, saying a Republican victory 'would have a tangible impact on improving the U.S.-Israel relationship.' That was precisely the worry in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, and where Obama - who lived there as a child - is scheduled to visit this month. Masdar Mas'udi, deputy chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim group with 30 million members, said he wanted Obama to vouch for creation of a Palestinian state. 'The Palestine issue is the core problem when the radicals or fundamentalist movements emerge,' he said. Mas'udi also said he feared the election's result will hamper Obama's outreach efforts to the Muslim world. 'We now feel more pessimistic about his ability to solve the problem between the Muslim world and the West,' he said. 'It's very regretful for me that his power has been decreasing, because we had such strong hopes with him.' In Pakistan, early reaction centered on fears that a divided U.S. Congress would take longer to approve military and civilian aid packages for the country. The Obama administration last week announced $2 billion in new military funding over five years for the Pakistani army, but the proposal awaits congressional approval. There were questions in world capitals whether Obama would be too politically weakened at home to pursue major initiatives abroad, or whether, like some of his predecessors in domestic difficulty, he would instead turn his attention more to foreign policy, where presidents still have more unilateral freedom to act. 'At the end of the day, a weak president means a weak United States,' said Oren Nahar, foreign news editor at Israel Radio, speaking during a radio discussion of the election results. He speculated that the Democratic defeat would make it more difficult for Obama to take bold steps abroad like striking Iran over its nuclear capability. Much like President Bill Clinton took solace from the Democratic defeat in the 1994 midterms, so does Obama embark this week on a lengthy trip to Asia, where he will be able to put aside temporarily the political setback at home for a turn on the global stage, where he remains widely admired. 'I think Obama is still very popular in Moscow power circles, where he's considered to be an extraordinary politician,' Lukyanov said. That sentiment is perhaps most pronounced in Kenya, where Obama's father was born, and Indonesia, where he has childhood roots. In Kenya, Obama-mania remains strong, even though some of his star power appears to have lost its luster. In comments posted on the Daily Nation, the nation's most respected national daily, readers were divided over Obama's policies and whether he would win a second term. And in Indonesia, Tin Sumartini Soemitro, sister-in-law to Lolo Soetoro, Obama's stepfather, said, 'My opinion might not be objective, but Barry is very smart. As president, him receiving a lot of criticism - it's normal. It happens here, too. A president cannot make everybody happy all the time.' But Obama's popularity has plummeted in Pakistan. A Pew Research Center poll this summer found just 8 percent of the public expressed confidence in Obama, the lowest percentage of any Muslim country. 'All the hype about hope and change that propelled Obama towards the White House in 2008 never seriously held out the prospect of a systemic overhaul,' wrote Mahir Ali, a columnist for Dawn, a leading English-language newspaper. Englund reported from Moscow.

1,"When she heard how much US Airways was going to charge to check her suitcase for a recent flight to Houston from Washington, Mary Barber took drastic action. At the check-in counter agent's suggestion, the Washington resident ran into a store at the Reagan National terminal and snapped up a neon-green nylon bag on sale for $6. She stuffed what she could from her suitcase into it. The remainder went into a cloth Whole Foods tote she had packed in her bag. Then Barber called her mother and asked her to come pick up the suitcase she had unloaded because it was over the 50-pound weight limit for checked luggage, thanks to some serious overpacking for a two-week visit with her daughter. The price for checking a bag for most passengers in coach: $25. The price for checking an overweight bag: an additional $50. That was $75 more than Barber was willing to pay. 'I hate it,' she said, of airlines' growing penchant for levying hefty baggage fees. 'It's already expensive for a ticket.' Barber was doing her best to channel George Clooney's checked-bags-are-for- suckers character in the Oscar-nominated movie 'Up in the Air.' Who can blame her? Last year, airlines reported nearly four cases of mishandled bags among every 1,000 passengers, even as they started charging more for checked luggage to increase revenues. As a result, passengers are increasingly _ and frantically _ searching for alternatives. They are packing their belongings more methodically into carry-on bags (and carrying too many of those onboard), leaving behind items they would normally travel with, shipping luggage to their destinations, or deliberately taking oversize bags to the gate in the hope that gate agents will check them for free. Ever-changing fees, meanwhile, are just the latest wrinkle in a chaotic baggage situation confronting today's airline passengers. Add it to heightened security, more overcrowded flights and fewer amenities in the air, and you have to wonder: Could it be the straw that makes airline travelers finally bag it? The failed Christmas Day attempt by the Underwear Bomber to blow up a plane sparked the latest round of baggage-related unpleasantness. Carry-on bags are coming under much more scrutiny, and because there are so many more of them, lines at security checkpoints have gotten more unwieldy. 'It has reached a tipping point as far as a hassle factor,' said Jami Counter, senior director of TripAdvisor Flights, an online flight search tool. 'I think we just have to live with the chaos until the next shoe drops, whatever that will be.' At the same time, passengers are struggling with a bewildering array of rules on carry-on luggage. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allows each passenger one carry-on bag and one 'personal item,' such as a laptop, a purse, a small backpack, a briefcase or a camera case. But as George Hobica, creator of low-airfare-alert site Airfarewatchdog.com, said, 'The personal item is a somewhat gray area.' The TSA screens any bag that fits through its X-ray machines, but it's up to the airlines to determine carry-on sizes. And they're all different. A JetBlue carry-on can't be longer than 17 inches, for instance, while Frontier allows up to 24 inches. It's also up to the airlines to enforce their carry-on rules, so many have sizers at their check-in counters to let people measure their bags. American even designed new sizers for each of its gates. But on recent visits to two airports, I didn't see a single passenger measuring a bag. The airlines, for their part, insist that there's no problem with bootleg baggage and that their employees can catch anyone trying to break the rules. But that can be tough to do when your workforce is shrinking. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. airlines had 3.3 percent fewer employees in November 2009 than they had the previous year. So it's no wonder that Harry Peachey managed to get a red suitcase, a duffel bag and a laptop bag through security and onto a United Airlines flight from Columbus, Ohio, to Washington a few weeks ago. What concerned him was the possibility that the airline would lose his bags. That had happened during a flight in November, leaving him without a change of clothes for a day. He was not about to let it occur again on his way to an elephant meeting in Johannesburg. (He's the elephant manager at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.) His flight from Columbus had been full, which meant that he had to battle other passengers for a coveted spot in the overhead bin. But he won. He had to hold his coat on his lap for the whole flight, but it was worth it, he said. Counter decries such situations for the effect they have on the passenger space on airplanes. 'It has become a little bit of a free-for-all on airplanes and turned them into almost a cargo hold,' he said, creating 'a lot of chaos and confusion from a customer's standpoint.' But at a time when airlines are still trying to lure back customers _ the number of people who flew on U.S. airlines in November 2009 was down 11.3 percent from November 2007 _ industry analysts wonder how much more passengers can take. 'I think the airlines are really pushing it,' Counter said. 'We've reached a breaking point.' At Reagan National Airport, traveler Becky Cattie, pulling magazines and paperwork out of her suitcase to get under the 50-pound limit for a checked bag on American Airlines, agreed. 'I think it's ridiculous, because I think a plane is safer with less carry-on,' she said. 'They should be charging people for carry-ons.' The airlines haven't gone that far _ yet. But after recent fee increases, passengers are paying at least $5 more to check each bag. Virgin America recently raised its baggage fee from $20 to $25 on flights after March 1. That follows similar moves last month by American, Delta, Continental and United, which raised their fees to $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second bag if checked in at the airport ticket counter, kiosk or curbside for domestic flights. (Some airlines offer discounts if you check bags online.) It's apparently a move of necessity. 'In order to entice people onto planes, they still have the $89 one-way coast-to-coast fares,' Hobica said. But 'heavy bags do consume fuel. The airlines are not in the freight business. When people have hundreds of pounds of bags, it does add to the cost. The airlines are trying to recoup that with fees.' They've done a good job of it. The industry took in $1.98 billion in baggage fees during the first three quarters of 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Only Southwest and JetBlue are bucking the trend; Southwest allows passengers to check in two bags for free, JetBlue one. And although Alaska Air charges $15 for the first bag and $25 for the second, it offers a baggage service guarantee that few others do. If a bag does not arrive within 25 minutes of the plane's arrival at the gate, passengers receive either a $25 voucher or 2,500 miles toward a future ticket. The airlines say they are trying to improve their handling of bags. Delta, for instance, will spend $40 million this year to enhance its baggage system to allow for the automated transfer of luggage in Atlanta, its largest hub. The airline also spent $100 million on improvements last year, which resulted in an 18 percent decrease in mishandled bags over the previous year. That's little comfort to travelers such as J.P. Bourget. On a recent flight from Rochester, N.Y., to Washington, he refused to check his bag, even though it obviously exceeded the 45-linear-inch limit for carry-ons. He had printed his boarding pass ahead of time so he could avoid the airline's first layer of defense against oversize bags: the check-in counter agent. 'If you don't check in at the front, the airline doesn't have a chance to get your money,' he said. And he got through the second layer of defense _ the security checkpoint _ even though 'everyone laughed at me all the way through.' Never mind that he was traveling for work and that his company would have reimbursed him for the $25 fee. He simply could not let the airline win. 'They're annoying, just a pain,' he said of the fees. 'All the fees are a pain. There's a fee to pay the fee.' His technique has worked a few times. When he's gotten caught at the gate, the airline has checked his bag for free. As we talked, he eyed me suspiciously. 'Don't ruin it for me,' he said. Bourget may simply have hit a lucky streak. Or flown on the right airline at the right time. Many airlines, such as Alaska Air and Delta, say they will only gate-check a bag for free if it doesn't exceed carry-on limits. 'The general policy we have is if you have followed all the rules in good faith and your carry-on is properly sized, and we've simply run out of space, we'll gate-check it for free,' said Tim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman. 'If someone does not play by the rules, we will gate-check but charge the fee that is applicable.' But flight attendants say that oversize bags often make it into the cabins. 'Once the carry-ons get into the plane, it's chaos,' said Corey Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants. 'It's out of control, and something needs to be done. We're seeing flight attendants with pulled muscles and strains and bruises from trying to manipulate those bags in the overhead bins.' Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill. is trying to come to their rescue. Last year, he introduced a bill to standardize carry-on sizes to a maximum of 50 linear inches. The airline industry opposes it, saying that planes' overhead bins come in different sizes. 'You can't legislate this kind of thing, and one size fits all literally doesn't apply to every situation or every aircraft type,' Smith said. Still, the airlines acknowledge that overhead bins have gotten crowded. 'It's a lot of bags to accommodate,' said Michelle Mohr, a spokeswoman for US Airways. 'It can be a challenge for a flight attendant to get these guys and bags on board.' They attribute the crowding to the fact that planes are much fuller because there are fewer flights. But it's also true that in some cases, the number of checked bags has dropped. US Airways, for instance, has seen the number of first checked bags fall by about 20 percent and the number of second by about 60 percent. "
1,"The Seattle City Attorney's Office has decided not to press charges against Microsoft founder Bill Gates' father after the community leader apologized for a hit-and-run collision and paid for damages. According to documents obtained by KIRO-TV, the incident happened in August. Investigators say they found Bill Gates Sr.'s Mercedes near Seattle Center, wedged against another car, with the engine running and the keys in the ignition. The police report says the owner of the other car called police and Gates' vehicle was towed. When he and a friend returned, the 84-year-old Gates was given a citation for a hit-and-run incident. No one was injured in the incident. Gates' friend said at the time that Gates may have had a 'senior moment' and didn't know he was so close to the other vehicle. A Gates family spokesman told KIRO-TV this week that Bill Gates Sr. was unaware of the incident until he returned to his car. ------ Information from: KIRO-TV, htthttp://www.kirotv.com/index.html "
1,"Less than 24 hours after a crude car bomb in a smoking Nissan Pathfinder transformed Times Square into a major crime scene, the popular tourist district slowly returned to its traditional role Sunday as businesses reopened and officials worked to reassure tourists and residents that the area was safe. 'It's a normal, beautiful sunny afternoon; people are hanging out at the tables and chairs; for better or worse we've all gotten used to some of this kind of craziness,' Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, told New York One. 'We have no indication that any Broadway show is canceled tonight or today, so anybody that was planning to come to Broadway should totally continue with that.' Federal authorities echoed that sentiment, saying that they were confident that the threat to tourists in New York's Theater district had been contained. 'Times Square I think is now safe,' said U.S. Secretary for Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told ABC News 'This Week.' Times Square had been seized with anxiety after a T-shirt vendor, Lance Orton, saw smoke billowing out of a Nissan sport-utility vehicle and alerted a NYPD officer Saturday. Orton, the T-shirt vendor who first spotted the smoke, emerged as a reluctant hero this weekend. Clearly irritated by the crush of reporters who pleaded with him for a quote, Orton said he needed 'to get some sleep.' Asked if he was happy to have played a role in alerting the police to the terror act, he said 'of course, man, I'm a veteran. What do you think?' Orton offered this advice to New Yorkers: 'You see something, you say something.' Officer Wayne Rhatigan responded to Orton's concern. 'I did a lap around the vehicle. The inside was smoking,' Rhatigan told the Daily News. 'I smelled gunpowder and knew it might blow any second.' Rhatigan called for backup as he and two rookie cops directed hundreds of people away from the smoking vehicle which had been parked outside the Minskoff Theater, home of the Disney play, 'The Lion King,' according to the New York paper. When Corrie van Buuren, a 56-year-old professor, left an Italian restaurant in Times Square on Saturday evening, she and her fellow diners walked into a scene of flashing police lights and metal barricades. 'We came out and everything was surrounded by police,' said van Buuren, who was visiting New York for the first time with fellow educators from Amsterdam. 'Nobody was panicking.' After observing the chaotic but controlled scene for about 30 minutes, van Buuren and her friends said they decided to head back to the hoteland were inconvenienced only by a few extra blocks of walking to get around the street closures. When asked if she would return to New York for another visit, van Buuren replied, 'Why not?' adding that she had been in Paris and Madrid during terrorist alerts. 'We felt very safe because everything was under control, with the police and firemen and ambulances.' Heraldo Munoz, a Chilean diplomat who headed a U.N. counterterrorism committee in 2003 and 2004 dealing with threats from the Taliban and al-Qaida, was eating dinner at a Chilean restaurant, Pomaire, about two blocks away from the site where the SUV was found. 'This is really a surprise. We have come to think New York, since the towers fell, has become a safer city,' Munoz said. 'I don't think you can make any conclusions at this point. There are so many crazies in the world. But this may suggest that the terrorist threat continues to be alive and it's never going away.' But the threat did not appear to deter tourists, families and even protesters who returned to Times Square, taking in the warm, sunny Sunday. Brandy Gagnou and Cara Gavagni made use of the remaining hours before their flight home to Cocoa Beach, Fla. They had looked forward to capping their weekend trip with office mates by seeing 'The Lion King' on Saturday, but their show was canceled. 'It was very intimidating last night,' said Gagnou, 28. 'I'm grateful they (police) were able to protect us, but now we have to go back ... I would love to come back.' Stacey Huckstapp from Britain was visiting her younger brother who had moved to the United States in November. She said she had been eager to visit her only sibling. But the 29-year-old said a number of events had curtailed her previous trips {ndash} first a strike by British Airways, then a snowstorm, followed by the volcanic ash that grounded European flights last month. 'I've finally got out here and now there's a bomb scare,' she said, before boarding a bus from Times Square to see her brother. 'All I've been wanting to do is give my brother a hug.' New York authorities were already ramping up security for the arrival of more than 180 foreign officials, including Iranian President Mahmoud Amhadinejad, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, for a major conference on nuclear weapons scheduled to start Monday at the United Nations. Senior U.N. diplomats said they expected the U.N. would have to increase their security preparedness. 'This is going to make it a circus,' said one senior diplomat. But U.N. officials said that there had been no indication by midday Sunday from U.N. security officials that the threat level would be raised for the U.N. conference. On Seventh Avenue, organizers were busy setting up for a planned peace rally in advance of the conference Sunday. The only sign of the massive evacuation from the previous evening were the metal barricades -- used to cordon off a 10-block area -- now pushed off to the side and stacked about a foot deep on the sidewalks. Joseph Gerson, an organizer of an anti-nuclear weapons rally that was to take place near Times Square, said he never doubted the event would happen as planned. 'It was not a big bomb. It was basically designed to reinforce fear,' said Gerson, of Boston. In light of the bomb scare, Gerson said, a benefit of the rally 'is to say, `Look, life goes on and we need to live without fear'.' ( "
1,"Suspected militants exploded a car bomb in a market crowded with women and children Wednesday, killing 105 people and turning shops selling wedding dresses, toys and jewelry into a mass of burning debris and bodies. The attack in the northwestern city of Peshawar was Pakistan's deadliest since 2007 and came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the country to offer support for its fight against a strengthening al-Qaida and Taliban-led insurgency based along the Afghan border. Clinton was three hours' drive away in the capital meeting Pakistani government leaders when the bomb went off in Peshawar. Her trip was not announced in advance in Pakistan for security reasons. The bomb was directed squarely at civilians, unlike many previous blasts that have targeted security forces or government or Western interests. While no one claimed responsibility, the bomb appeared aimed at undercutting public and political support for an ongoing army offensive against militants close to the frontier and showing that the government was unable to keep its people safe. The shaky, U.S.-backed government said the bombing -- the latest in a series this month -- had strengthened its resolve to press ahead with the assault in the South Waziristan border region, a militant stronghold and a global training and operations hub for al-Qaida. At least 60 of the dead were women and children. Most security analysts said the attack could backfire on the insurgents and lead more people to inform on them. 'He who kills a Muslim has no place but hell,' said Mumtaz Ali, a wounded 19-year-old who was studying in a Muslim school attached to a mosque that was damaged in the attack. 'We are taught the way of the prophet. We are not taught to kill innocent people.' The U.S. believes fighting the insurgents on the frontier is vital to defeating extremism in Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan, where Taliban militants with links to those in Pakistan are waging an ever more violent campaign against American and NATO troops. Underlining the threat in both nations, Taliban militants in suicide vests stormed a guest house used by U.N. staff in the heart of the Afghan capital on Wednesday, killing 11 people -- six of them U.N. staff, including one American. The bombing just before 1:15 p.m. destroyed much of the Mina Bazaar in Peshawar's old town, a warren of narrow alleys clogged with stalls, shops and food sellers. The district drew mostly poor female shoppers and their children in this conservative city. Fire swept through the area after the blast, sending a cloud of gray smoke into the air. The wounded sat amid burning debris and parts of bodies. Men tried to pull survivors from beneath wreckage. One carried away a baby with a bloody face and a group of men rescued a young boy covered in dust, but others found only bodies of the dead. 'My son died here,' one man cried. A two-story building collapsed as firefighters doused it with water, causing more panic. Several hours later, people were still searching the debris for loved ones. 'There was a deafening sound, and I was like a blind man for a few minutes,' said Mohammad Usman, who was wounded in the shoulder. 'I heard women and children crying and started to help others. There was the smell of human flesh in the air.' Police officer Khan Abbas said the death toll rose to 105 after three bodies were recovered from the debris and two of the more than 200 wounded died overnight. Clinton was a few hours into her first visit to Pakistan as secretary of state when the bomb exploded. 'I want you to know this fight is not Pakistan's alone,' she said at a news conference that many Pakistani TV stations broadcast alongside images of burning buildings and wounded victims. 'These extremists are committed to destroying what is dear to us as much as they are committed to destroying that which is dear to you and to all people. So this is our struggle as well.' Standing beside her, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the attack would not break the government's will. 'The resolve and determination will not be shaken,' Qureshi said. 'People are carrying out such heinous crimes. They want to shake our resolve. I want to address them: We will not buckle. We will fight you.' Clinton's three-day visit is designed to get maximum public exposure to improve America's image in a country where many people dislike and distrust the United States. She plans to meet with students, business leaders and opposition figures, as well as government and military leaders. 'It is fair to say there have been a lot of misconceptions about what the United States intends for our relationship with Pakistan,' Clinton told reporters flying with her. 'It is unfortunate there are those who question our motives. I want to clear the air.' Peshawar, the economic hub of the northwest and the seat of the provincial government, has long been a favorite target of militants who control large parts of nearby tribal regions near the Afghan border. Extremism has flourished there since it was used as a staging ground in the 1980s for U.S.-funded fighters preparing to battle the Soviet-installed regime in Afghanistan. The attack brought the death toll from militant bombings or commando-style raids to more than 300 in October alone. Three blasts have taken place in Peshawar, including another attack in a nearby market that killed 50. The Taliban have claimed the attacks on government, army or Western targets in calls to media organizations, but not ones killing civilians. It was the deadliest bombing in Pakistan since a suicide bomber hit the homecoming festivities for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in the southern city of Karachi in October 2007, killing around 150 people. Bhutto was later killed slain in a separate attack. Hussain blamed the militants based in South Waziristan for Wednesday's attack. 'We are hitting them at their center of terrorism, and they are hitting back targeting Peshawar,' he said. 'This is a tough time for us. We are picking up the bodies of our women and children, but we will follow these terrorists and eliminate them.' ------ Khan reported from Peshawar and Burns from Islamabad. "
1,"The number of children being raised by their grandparents has risen sharply since the onset of the recession in 2007, according to a new Pew Research Center study that said one in 10 U.S. children now lives with a grandparent. The trend was most noticeable among whites, Pew said in its analysis of census data. Caucasians who were primary caregivers for their grandchildren rose 9 percent from 2007 to 2008, compared with a 2 percent increase in black grandparents and no change among Hispanics. In all, 2.9 million children are being raised mainly by at least one grandparent. For most of the decade, the number of children having a grandparent as their primary caretaker rose slowly and steadily, Pew noted. Then came the deep and lingering recession, which began in December 2007. As the economy soured, the rise was sudden and steep. So while there has been an 8 percent increase in the number of grandparents raising their grandkids, more than half of that _ 5 percent _ occurred between 2007 and 2008. Another factor behind the rise is military parents who leave their children with grandparents during multiple deployments as the nation has fought wars on two fronts, said Donna Butts, executive director of Generations United, which focuses on intergenerational issues. 'The stress on families is much more severe than it used to be,' she said. 'During the African American migration from the South, people were going forward to find a job, make a better home, and grandparents watched the children until the parents settled and sent for them. Everybody was happy. Now we're finding families in which oftentimes the children have emotional issues. If there's been a loss of a house, a loss of a job, the need to retrain for another, you're talking about people whose dreams have changed and whose lives have dramatically changed. They have to come to terms with that, as well as the new roles they all have to assume.' "
1,"Germany wants General Motors to increase its contribution to the Opel unit's reorganization before considering whether to provide state aid, according to two people familiar with the matter. Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle is using a two-day U.S. visit, which includes a meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Washington, to express that view, said the people, who declined to be identified because the discussions are confidential. GM has said it will provide $836 million for Opel's restructuring and ask for as much as $3.7 billion from European governments. Germany made money available last year to keep Opel afloat and is more cautious about providing aid after GM backed out of an agreement to sell the unit to Magna International, the bidder favored by Germany, the people said. Detroit- based GM decided in November to retain Opel. The German government expects GM to file a request for state loans by mid-February, they said. GM has said it needs financial support from governments including Britain, Spain and Poland. The carmaker hasn't given a breakdown of how much it wants from each country and it's unclear how much more Germany wants GM to contribute. Geithner and Bruederle 'discussed the state of the global recovery and their shared commitment to international cooperation around financial reform,' Natalie Wyeth, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in a statement after the meeting Monday, without saying whether the officials talked about Opel. Sarah Schneid, a German Economy Ministry spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tom Wilkinson, a GM spokesman in Detroit, also declined to comment and referred questions to GM Europe. Opel plans to put in a request for financial aid once the review is completed as early as this week, said Stefan Weinmann, a spokesman for GM Europe. 'The German government has set out a process for how to apply for aid, and we're following that,' Weinmann said. 'Part of the requirement is to have an outside party review the request.' Bruederle, a deputy leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, took over as economy minister Oct. 28, days before GM decided to keep Opel. The Free Democrats opposed excessive government involvement in Opel and the creation of a trust last June to facilitate the sale of the carmaker to an investor. His predecessor, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, had brokered a sale of Opel with German state financing. Opel said Jan. 21 that it will halt production this year at Antwerp, Belgium, the first restructuring move after more than a year of talks with unions on scaling back the workforce and production capacity. The closure is part of GM's effort to restore profit at Opel and its British sister brand Vauxhall by eliminating 8,300 jobs and cutting capacity by 20 percent.

1,"COMMERCE CITY, Colo. - Everything about Reunion is meant to be perfect. The houses in this middle-class, master-planned neighborhood 20 miles outside Denver evoke the front-porch intimacy of a small town. Large faux farm silos adorn the grand landscaped entrance. The fishing pond shimmers. The small sign on Reunion Parkway boasts, 'Happily ever after starts here.' Politically, Reunion was meant also to be part of the perfect congressional district, one drawn up after the 2000 Census to be an absolutely 50-50 suburban swing district. There would be no better place in America to judge the mood of the electorate. Today, the mood in many of the houses along Reunion's curving sidewalks is one of disappointment. 'I've never been more disenchanted,' said Donna Mastrangelo, 48, who moved here from Arizona in 2005. She supported Barack Obama in 2008 but now thinks the president overreached. Sitting on a park bench on a balmy afternoon, she turned to her husband, Louis, and said: 'We can be swayed any which way at this point. . . . I don't want anyone to assume my vote anymore. I want them to work for it.' In 2008, 59 percent of the voters in Colorado's 7th District were swayed by Obama's promise of a government that works for the middle class. That year they reelected their Democratic congressman, Ed Perlmutter, for a second term. The swing district had swung - from Republican in its early years, to Democratic. After four years of Democratic control in Washington, however, many independents here who voted for Obama now voice varying degrees of disapproval for the president and his party. They say they are frustrated by his inability to forge bipartisan compromise. They say Obama and the Democrats pursued an agenda that was too liberal and have not done enough to shore up the economy. Sentiments like this can be overheard all around Reunion, and in outer-ring suburban neighborhoods across the country. Democrats rose to power in Washington in part with a concerted effort to expand their base of support to include the moderate, college-educated and increasingly diverse voters who now populate the farther-out bedroom communities around Denver, Las Vegas, Washington and other metropolitan areas that rose up over the past decade. This is not tea party country. The two dozen independent voters here who spoke to The Washington Post this month were more practical than ideological in their political views. They said they support politicians based on the everyday concerns that affect their lives: schools, jobs, traffic, the economy. These suburbanites often decide elections, and Democrats are trying hard to keep hold of them. 'The battle of every election comes down to how far out into the suburbs can you push the line of Democratic dominance,' said Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and co-author of a 2002 book, 'The Emerging Democratic Majority.' 'The Democrats have had a lot of success pushing that line out from the urban core. But I think Republicans will reassert their dominance in the farther-flung exurbs. Where is that line going to be drawn? That's going to determine how well the Republicans do.' In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, independent voters in the country's suburban areas said they support Republican congressional candidates over Democrats by a 2-to-1 margin (62 to 30 percent). 'There is no question we are struggling with them today,' said Democratic pollster Andrew Myers, who is tracking suburban voters in Colorado and other states. 'If ultimately we lose them, it will be like one of the legs of our stool was knocked out.' Reunion was built in 2002, a settlement near Denver International Airport, featuring 1,500 homes starting in the $200,000 range. It is one of many subdivisions that sprouted around Denver during the construction boom of the past decade. The median household income and home values here are well above the national average. But when the real estate market cratered, so did construction. According to county records, 252 homes here have gone into foreclosure, about 16 percent of Reunion's housing stock. Instead of the Wal-Mart Supercenter that was promised at Reunion, there's a Starbucks, a Supercuts and a few small stores. Sun- scorched weeds inhabit the huge plot where Reunion Town Center was supposed to stand. Alongside Reunion's perfectly groomed sports field one evening, the parents watching their young children play flag football were worried - about the value of their homes, losing their jobs, about the nation's slack economy. 'I'm anxious,' said Jennifer Wallace, 35. A lifelong independent, Wallace said she voted for Obama because she thought he could fix the economy. But recently, she said, her husband was laid off when a Chinese firm swallowed up the die-casting company where he worked. 'The unemployment was supposed to go down, and it's not,' Wallace said. 'You hear the housing market is coming back, but it's not. Not here. We were the fastest-growing, the up-and-coming, and then it just stopped. We don't even have our grocery store, yet.' Wallace said she knows she can't blame it all on Obama. But she blames him enough that she says she will vote in November for Ryan Frazier, Perlumutter's Republican opponent, and Ken Buck, the Republican hoping to unseat Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat. Young Nam, returning home to Reunion one evening from his job running a home builder's design center, said he voted for Obama in 2008. He believed Obama could fix the economy and reshape the country's future. 'If you asked me 90 days after Obama's beginning, I was warm to him,' said Nam, an independent who backed Republicans in the early 2000s. But the 42-year-old immigrant from South Korea lamented that Obama 'made some missteps.' 'I think he took on health care when it was not the priority,' Nam said. 'There were more pressing needs . . . Would I vote for Democrats again? Well, it would be dependent on the platforms and pitches.' (Begin optional trim) Robert E. Lang, co-director of Brookings Mountain West and a demographer who studies suburban and exurban political trends, said independent voters here in Denver's emerging exurbs are similar to those in Northern Virginia, a growing territory that was critical to Democrats' successes in 2006 and 2008, but that helped push GOP Gov. Robert McDonnell to a victory in 2009. 'They want government to be light, to be effective, to be tailored to their needs,' Lang said. 'They gave the Democrats a chance in two cycles, but they're not exactly loyal to anybody. These are people who've seen house price depreciation. They have mortgages underwater or they've lost the retirement wealth they've generated over a decade, and they're going to point the finger at somebody.' Earlier this year few predicted Perlmutter would face competition from a Republican challenger, considering his comfortable margin of victory in 2008. But Frazier, a City Council member from the nearby suburb of Aurora, is a charismatic campaigner. Strategists in both parties say it could emerge as a sleeper race. 'People are starting to have a bit of buyer's remorse,' Frazier said in an interview. He said Perlmutter, who supported most of the Democratic agenda, is out of step with the public. Perlmutter acknowledges that his constituents may prove unfaithful. He hears it all the time as he walks suburban neighborhoods knocking on doors. 'It's a testy year, and I need all the help I can get,' the congressman, in a T-shirt and jeans, told one voter as he made his rounds in Lakewood, an older suburb close to Denver. The man told Perlmutter he probably could count on his vote. 'Could you put up a yard sign?' That he would have to think about.

1,"Lorillard Inc., the largest U.S. maker of menthol cigarettes, is urging regulators to review testimony by some government scientists indicating the mint flavor makes cigarettes more harmful. The Food and Drug Administration began examining the health impact of menthol in cigarettes in March, and a new round of hearings on the matter begins this week. 'We are looking for accuracy along the way,' William True, Lorillard's senior vice president of research and development, said in an interview. 'There will be much more this week in terms of quantifiable, measurable science.' Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette brand in the country, accounted for about 92 percent of Lorillard's more than $5 billion in sales last year. The FDA is reviewing the health risks of menthol in cigarettes and has until March 2012 to decide whether to ban them. True, 48, is among executives from Lorillard and larger rivals Altria Group Inc. and Reynolds American Inc. scheduled to testify at the hearings in Gaithersburg, Md. Leonard Jones, Lorillard's director of direct marketing and marketing research, will testify after the panel asked tobacco companies in March to provide data on how they make and market menthol cigarettes. Some of the FDA's staff testimony in March consisted of 'cherry-picking' of scientific research pointing to possibly greater health risks from menthol, Greensboro, N.C.- based Lorillard said in a 34-page brief submitted to the advisory panel June 29. 'The best available science does not support an assertion that menthol in cigarettes impacts public health,' the company said. 'The fact that, in several instances, the information and conclusions presented were incomplete and/or inaccurate has tainted the process and the committee,' True said in an accompanying letter to Lawrence Deyton, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. Lorillard provided a copy of the letter to Bloomberg News. Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the FDA, declined to comment on True's remarks. A law signed by President Barack Obama in June 2009 gave the FDA unprecedented power to restrict the marketing of tobacco products to youths and banned companies from adding flavors such as clove or strawberry to cigarettes. The law allowed menthol-flavored cigarettes, the most popular flavor, to stay on the market unless the FDA determines they're more of a health risk than regular cigarettes. "
1,"Tiger Woods fans have put up with the philandering, the text messages and the domestic spats. Now comes what may be the hardest thing of all to tolerate: losing. Woods has played through the year without a single tournament win, putting him at 83rd on the PGA Tour's money list. As his performance slumps, so have sales of his apparel line through Nike, according to retailers Golfsmith International Holdings, Roger Dunn Golf Shops and Golf Discount Superstore. Golf apparel sales overall are on the rise, signaling consumers are returning to the course _ just not to Woods. Nike gets about 10 percent of its golf sales from the Woods brand, whose shirts, jackets and pants are among the most expensive clothing the sportswear maker sells. 'Apparel is hot right now,' said Laura Dowdy, the clothing buyer for Roger Dunn, which has more than 20 stores. 'Everything: Adidas, Puma, Nike, except the Tiger brand.' Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., doesn't disclose sales for the Tiger Woods Collection. Nike gets about $650 million in sales tied to the sport, according to Matt Powell, an analyst at Charlotte, N.C.-based researcher SportsOneSource, who provided the estimate for sales of the Woods line. 'We support Tiger and never underestimate his abilities as a competitor,' Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in an e-mail. 'He's a phenomenal athlete with over 70 wins on the PGA Tour and 95 wins worldwide.' She declined to comment further. Woods's representatives didn't return calls or e-mails seeking comment. The line's volume through the first half dropped 7.5 percent from a year earlier at Golfsmith's 72 stores, Chief Executive Officer Martin Hanaka said. Total golf apparel sales climbed 11 percent over the same period at the Austin, Texas-based retailer. 'The Tiger effect has been negative this year,' Hanaka said. 'Fortunately, other Nike products and other brands have been doing well, so we've been able to overcome it.' Nike's apparel sales climbed 13 percent in the quarter ended May 31, and its golf apparel sales also have climbed about that much this year, according to Powell. The retailer is now selling the fall 2010 men's collection on its website. The cover boy? Not Tiger. It's 2009 British Open Champion Stewart Cink. Woods appears in a list of 'athletes' on a linked page. Other than his rookie season, when he finished 24th, Woods has been in the top four on the money list every year on tour. This month, he recorded the worst 72-hole score _ 18 over par _ of his professional career. 'When Tiger's doing well, people watch and buy his brand,' said David Martin, a branding expert with almost three decades of experience who runs Interbrand's New York office and global golf practice. 'When he's not, people decide not to watch and they buy something else.' Online retailer Golf Discount Superstore said it's seen a 'definite decline' for the brand. Roger Dunn, a division of Santa Ana, Calif.-based Worldwide Golf Enterprises, says almost all other apparel products are growing save for Tiger's line. 'Before, he was a champion,' said Patrick Rishe, a sports business professor at Webster University in St. Louis, Mo., and director of Sportsimpacts, which analyzes the economic impact of sports events. 'He conveyed discipline and consistency. Now he's lost that aura of perfection, on and off the course, and there's no way Nike can create that aura again.' Woods's personal problems haven't helped. His lawyer announced Monday that his divorce from model Elin Nordegren was completed, nine months after reports of his extramarital affairs surfaced. Woods, 34, crashed his Cadillac sport-utility vehicle into a fire hydrant outside his Florida home last Thanksgiving, leading to his admission that he had relationships with several women during his marriage. One of those women, Joslyn James, created a website showcasing alleged text messages from the golfer that described various sex acts. Nike first signed Woods to a five-year endorsement contract in 1996. The retailer has described the Tiger Woods Collection, launched in 1999, as 'Nike Golf's top-of-the-line apparel,' with sweaters and pants that cost more than $100 on the company's website. Nike hasn't discounted its Woods Collection apparel and probably won't, according to Powell, who says the company is counting on Woods returning to form and being 'an important part of its portfolio.' Golfsmith also has no plans to lower prices for the brand, according to its chief marketing officer. 'The challenge to Nike is that we've never seen Tiger Woods weak before, and it's completely antithetical to what his brand is,' Interbrand's Martin said. 'Some athletes can ski off into our memory as stars, but for Tiger, unless he gets it together this winter and starts winning, his career trajectory is a double-black diamond,' or exceptionally steep slope. Not everyone has abandoned Woods. Clint Utz, 28, said he owns about 15 Tiger Woods Collection shirts and has bought several this year. 'All of a sudden, so many people were against him, but he's still the same person that worked hard and achieved things no one else has ever achieved,' said Utz, a marketing director for Landscapes Unlimited in Lincoln, Neb. 'Everyone loves a winner. They'll come back.' "
1,"Jenny Potter is reveling in the little delights of her fourth trip to the Olympics, from new jerseys and fresh ice sheets to the daily teasing from U.S. women's hockey teammates who call her Potsy or Mom. That perspective is always on the 31-year-old Potter's mind after the changes in her life since the last games. Her husband and two children will be in Vancouver to cheer the Americans' run at another gold medal, but her mother won't be in the seats Potter's family bought for her just a few months ago. 'With my mom passing away, it's become more about how you live your life,' Potter said Thursday. 'I'm enjoying everything about this experience. It's just about living life to the fullest and working hard each day, and then spending time with your family and being grateful.' Potter, the only mother on the U.S. team, has been playing international hockey since 1997, yet her decade-long balance between family and hockey is almost as impressive as her wrist shot. She took one winter off for the birth of her now-9-year-old daughter, Maddy, but returned a year later for the Salt Lake Olympics. Six years after that, she played into the fifth month of her pregnancy with her now-3-year-old son Cullen -- and she returned for the 2007 world championships just three months after giving birth. Potter's husband, Rob, is a high school coach and together they also run a hockey school in Minnesota. With help from family and friends, they manage to juggle their hectic schedule -- but the sudden loss of Potter's mother added a bittersweet element to this Olympic run. Terri Schmidgall died at 57 on Nov. 20 from a persistent form of melanoma, which returned aggressively several months ago. Just 11 days earlier, Potter's grandmother also died at 89. 'When she was going through that, it was going through the team,' U.S. coach Mark Johnson said. 'It was hard, especially for the kids that are close to Jenny. It was tough on Jenny, and she persevered. She has grown from it.' Potter is the Americans' oldest player, one year older than fellow four-time Olympic defenseman Angela Ruggiero -- and her teammates make sure she remembers it. Potter relishes the jabs, yet she's also embracing her role as a teacher and a more vocal leader for young teammates who grew up idolizing speedy little Jenny Schmidgall in the Nagano Games. 'I grew up in a different era, playing against boys and learning the fundamentals,' Potter said. 'Today, it's all about breakaways and having a good move in the shootout. What I've tried to tell some of the younger players is how I pride myself on conditioning and work ethic. If you're willing to keep working hard all the time, you're going to get better.' Potter spent the past two summers training with Hilary Knight, who emerged as the U.S. team's surprise leading scorer during the months leading up to the Olympics. Knight and 20-year-old twins Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux all look up to Potter for both her skill and maturity. 'Potsy has been great to us since we met her,' Jocelyne Lamoureux said. 'We remember all the way back to Nagano, seeing hockey on television and thinking it was great. Now we get the chance to play with her. It's pretty amazing.' "
1,"A member of President Mahmoud Abbas' inner circle says the Palestinian leadership made a mistake by suspending action on a Gaza war crimes report. It's the first such acknowledgment after days of angry protests in the West Bank and Gaza. The U.N. report alleged that Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in Gaza last winter. Last week, Abbas gave in to U.S. pressure and agreed to suspend the push for war crimes tribunals. Abbas aides defended the decision by saying they were only delaying, not dropping action. However, on Wednesday, senior Abbas adviser Yasser Abed Rabbo said that 'we have the courage to admit there was a mistake.' The Palestinians are now seeking to have the U.N. Security Council consider the Gaza report. "
1,"Consumers will have to divulge more personal information to apply for store credit cards _ possibly putting the brakes on so-called instant credit _ under sweeping industry reforms made final Tuesday by the Federal Reserve. The measure, which takes effect Feb. 22, requires all credit card issuers to consider shoppers' income and ability to pay before granting approval for a card. The rule aims to tighten the lax lending standards that helped fuel the financial crisis. Retailers say the new measure could disrupt popular promotions that motivate shoppers, such as discounts for opening a credit card. Typically, retailers quickly approve new accounts based on customers' credit scores. The new regulations require that they also consider shoppers' income and assets. 'Consumers are not going to want to have that conversation,' said Mallory Duncan, a lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, a trade group. The provision is just one in 1,155 pages of regulations approved Tuesday by the Fed to implement the next phase of the landmark credit card legislation approved last year. The Fed mandated new strictures on everything from billing cycles to payment allocation to interest-rate increases that together represent a massive overhaul of the credit card industry. Retailers had sought exemption from the requirement that credit issuers consider consumers' ability to pay for their charges, citing the relatively small credit lines typically extended. They also that said collecting income data would be onerous: Shoppers may not want to share such sensitive information with store employees or may not have an accurate account. That could delay applications or discourage sales altogether. Several big-name retailers sent letters to the Fed in protest, including Macy's and Best Buy. 'If this practice discourages the use of consumer credit, it will have a negative impact on retail sales and will result in a slower rate of recovery from the ongoing recession,' Macy's senior counsel, Steven Franks, wrote to the Fed in November. Consumer advocates, on the other hand, thought the provision did not go far enough. The National Consumer Law Center said it asked the Fed to tighten the regulations by requiring credit card issuers _ including retailers _ to verify income, not just collect the information. 'This culture of easy credit is what got us into trouble in lots of different arenas,' NCLC staff attorney Chi Chi Wu said. According to Fitch Ratings, a greater percentage of retail credit cards went unpaid _ or charged off _ than prime credit cards last year. About 12.6 percent of retail cards were charged off in December compared with 10.7 percent of prime cards, though the latter saw a bigger jump over the year. "

1,The suspects in a drive-by shooting that killed seven people outside an Egyptian church on Coptic Christmas Eve will be tried in an emergency state security court. Prosecutor General Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud on Saturday referred the three suspects to trial on murder charges. The Jan. 6 attack killed six Copts and one Muslim in the southern town of Nag Hamadi. The shooting shocked Egypt's Coptic minority and underscored the government's failure to address chronic sectarian strains in a society where religious radicalism is gaining ground. The Interior Ministry called the shooting a revenge attack for the alleged November rape of a 12-year-old Muslim girl by a Christian man. Egypt's emergency courts normally handle cases involving terrorism. 
1,"Open-Faced Avocado Cheese Melt 4 servings Small touches take these sandwiches from simple to satisfying. The original recipe calls for a sprinkling of truffle-flavored salt; if you can't find it but have some truffle oil and flaked sea salt on hand, you're set. If you're feeling adventuresome, try the optional add-ons mentioned below. Serve with a salad or fresh fruit. Adapted from 'Anna Getty's Easy Green Organic' (Chronicle, 2010). Ingredients 8 ounces Gouda cheese About 1/3 loaf of unsliced seven-grain bread 2 ripe avocados 2 teaspoons mayonnaise Sweet paprika Truffle oil Flaked sea salt, preferably Maldon Jarred roasted red peppers (optional) 2 cooked, crisp slices of bacon (optional) 2 or 3 lemon wedges (optional) Steps Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet (large or small) with aluminum foil. Cut the cheese into 8 or 12 slices. Cut the bread into 4 thick slices. Cut the avocados in half lengthwise, then peel and pit the halves. Cut each half into thin slices. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the mayonnaise on the top of each slice of bread, then place the slices (mayo sides up) on the lined baking sheet (or if using a toaster oven, build half of the sandwiches on a separate piece of foil). Arrange half an avocado's worth of slices on each slice of bread. Lightly sprinkle the avocado slices with paprika. Here's your chance to improvise: If desired, combine 1/4 teaspoon truffle oil with 1/4 teaspoon sea salt in a small bowl, using your fingertips to make sure the salt is well coated, to make truffled salt. Sprinkle the salt onto one or more portions of the avocados. Alternatively, top individual portions with strips of roasted red pepper or 2 cooked strips of bacon; or squeeze the lemon wedges over the avocado. Use the slices of cheese to cover the avocado on top of each sandwich. Toast for about 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted. (If using the toaster oven, repeat with the remaining 2 sandwiches.)

1,"The government is promising 'the most spectacular celebration in history' and throwing more than $40 million on the table for parades and fireworks to commemorate the country's 200th anniversary this week. But on the eve of their bicentennial, many Mexicans confess they're in no mood for a party. As the country prepares to follow President Felipe Calderon in the traditional 'grito,' or shout-out of 'Viva Mexico!' on Wednesday night, the country's historians, politicians and artists agree the country is in a deep funk. 'It feels like Mexico is out of gas,' said Hector Reyes, a car dealer who with his wife and kids watched workers erect TV camera scaffolds in the capital's central plaza to broadcast the events. These days the news feels like an endless rerun of the same cop show as one mid- level drug capo after another is arrested or killed. Last month it was El Nacho. Then it was La Barbie. This week, El Grande. All of them - beefy thugs with fashionable sports shirt, living in a nice big house, with lots of guns and grenades - are quickly replaced. 'Because when one is captured, the next in line steps up,' said Jorge Romero, a representative in congress. A popular movie in theaters here to commemorate the bicentennial is called simply 'Hell.' Billboards touting the film are a tragic-comic tableau of the state of the state: the grinning narco in his cowboy hat and white suit standing alongside a fictional version of the real-life 'El Pozolero,' the infamous Stewmaker, who disposed of corpses in a 50-gallon drum of lye. The movie is gruesome but funny, and audiences laugh and gasp, as corrupt cops, mayors, dopers and even a priest are mowed down by AK-47s and dispatched with the newest symbol of Mexican macho - the chainsaw. 'I hate to speak ill of Mexico, especially with those from abroad, but to be honest, Mexico has a number of problems that have become endemic, which become part of our culture, our idiosyncrasies, and those problems are things such as corruption and impunity and social inequalities,' said Luis Estrada, the film's director.'It is a sad conclusion, but as a society and country, we have very little to celebrate.' In a poll published last week in the newspaper Reforma, 67 percent of Mexico City residents said they felt little or no excitement about the bicentennial. Nearly 6 in 10 said the money spent was not worth it. 'Mexicans are stoic, but we know how to rejoice in little things. We are very good at making fiestas, but the mood is very sour now, you could say it is almost sad,' said Enrique Krauze, author of some of the most popular histories of Mexico. Even the church appears to be experiencing a moment of doubt. 'We are a generous and hospitable people, but we are realizing with surprise and shame that we have become a people corrupt and murderous,' the Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico concluded in a recent editorial. The church was attacking the criminal gangs engaged in human smuggling and the many Mexican officials disinterested in protecting the rights of passers- through. Many here were shocked by the massacre of 72 illegal migrants from Central and South America, including women and teens, whose bodies were found in an abandoned barn in northern Mexico last month. Though many north of the border might assume that Cinco de Mayo is Mexico's Fourth of July, it is actually the anniversary of the Mexican military's upset victory over French troops at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862 - an event not much remembered here in Mexico, though Mexico's Jose Cuervo tequila empire certainly benefits from its sales in the United States on that day. On Monday, Calderon attended an annual reenactment by hundreds of Mexican troops - dressed in costume - of the glories of Mexico past, the kind of mingling of myth and air-brushed history that every country rolls out to celebrate its anniversaries. Mexico's bicentennial honors two revolutions, two wars for independence. The first from Spain, which was sparked by an uprising of peasant farmers in 1810. Led by a priest with big ideas, Miguel Hidalgo, the insurrection was quickly crushed and Hidalgo executed. The second Mexican revolution began in 1910 and saw Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata wage war against the federal forces of velvet-gloved dictator Porfirio Diaz, who decamped to his beloved Paris in 1911 after stealing his last election. But the fighting dragged on another seven years. Hundreds of thousands died violent deaths or succumbed to plagues of malaria, influenza and typhus. 'This is a moment where we don't know where we are and we don't know where we are going,' said historian Lorenzo Meyer, who also hosts a popular evening round table on television. Meyer said the holiday has its enthusiasts, 'but it's a bureaucratic enthusiasm, a staged and not very sincere enthusiasm.' For weeks, anonymous e-mails have encouraged citizens not to participate in the government sponsored celebrations. And the presidential candidate who lost to Calderon in a contested election in 2006, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is hosting an alternative celebration a few blocks away from Calderon's. Public events in besieged cities such as Ciudad Juarez on the border have been canceled, others have been scaled back, as extreme security precautions are being implemented to confront feared acts of narco-terrorism. To make matters better - or worse? - alcohol sales end Tuesday at midnight. "
1,"The United States will urge governments around the world to deploy controversial whole body-imaging scanners at airports to detect explosives and other objects hidden beneath people's clothing, President Obama said Thursday. The announcement came as Obama and top security aides detailed intelligence failures and responses to aviation security gaps uncovered in the Dec. 25 incident in which a 23-year-old Nigerian man linked to al- Qaida allegedly tried to blow up an Amsterdam-to-Detroit flight with explosives hidden in his underwear. On air travel screening, administration officials elaborated on decisions previously announced: ramping up the presence of federal air marshals on the 2,000-daily U.S.-bound international flights, for example; and buying 300 advanced imaging scanners, as previously planned, to augment 40 already in place and 150 set to be deployed later this year. Obama called on U.S. intelligence and security communities to strengthen terrorist watch lists, especially the nation's no-fly list, by expanding criteria for people to be included. The president also demanded reviews that could lead to additional travelers being subjected to time-consuming secondary security checks at airports, as well as visa denials and revocations at consulates. One sensitive debate is whether and how to expand scrutiny at airports beyond the roughly 4,000 people on the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list and a 'selectee' list of about 14,000 people identified for further questioning, one senior domestic security official said. Alleged Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was never placed on those lists. Another possibility includes conducting more detailed customs screening earlier and overseas, before individuals board U.S.-bound flights. 'Everything is under review right now,' one senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In his remarks, Obama focused on expanding international aviation security partnerships. 'There's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flights, into American each day, domestic and international,' he said. 'It will require significant investments in many areas.' The U.S. government will seek to ensure that 'training and capacity is built in continents around the globe,' added Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. On Monday, Napolitano dispatched senior aides to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, South America and Africa to discuss how governments collect and share passenger data. Napolitano said DHS will encourage foreign authorities to use the same new technologies at airports that send flights to the United States, and work with the State Department to strengthen international security measures and standards. Her department will also partner with the Department of Energy's national laboratories to research new screening technologies. The 40 so-called whole body-imaging scanners are in use at 19 airports, covering a tiny fraction of 450 domestic airports and 2,100 screening lanes. Congress and the Obama administration dedicated $25 million in economic stimulus funds last year to purchase another 150 screeners, and plans to buy 300 more, at a cost of $130,000 to $170,000 each. Since the attack, Canada announced it will purchase 44 machines and the Dutch said they will expand the number of units at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport from 15 to 60 in coming weeks, both intended for U.S.-bound passengers. Britain said it will consider expanding use of the machines. Privacy advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Privacy Information Center, say the screening amounts to a 'virtual strip search,' creating graphic images that are prone to abuse. U.S. officials said that the software blurs faces, and that the images are not normally saved and are reviewed by officials who do not see the travelers being screened. Nevertheless, lawmakers in Europe and the United States last year limited use of the scanners. Several experts also advocate expanding pre-flight screening that now is done only by customs officials once travelers land at U.S. airports. Obama aides acknowledged Thursday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials accessed a catch-all terrorism-related list of 550,000 people, including Abdulmutallab, after his flight took off and were prepared to question him on landing. Customs officials could have viewed the data before takeoff and contacted agents at Schiphol to work with airlines and the Dutch to stop him. CBP officials do not generally search through such databases unless an individual is already placed on no-fly or other watch lists. A DHS official said the program is designed to scrutinize national security threats, not all 1 million people who enter the United States daily. But Stewart Baker, former DHS assistant secretary for policy, said the CBP's Immigration Advisory Program could be expanded at Schiphol and eight other overseas airports to incorporate further checks. 'What's the point of having them there, if they do no more than checking somebody else's homework?' agreed Susan Ginsburg, who has served on security advisory committees to the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. "
1,"EU governments should stop deepwater drilling projects if they have any safety doubts, the EU said Wednesday, stopping short of an outright ban such as the one the U.S. imposed after the disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger proposed better and uniform safety rules for oil platforms off Europe's shores ensuring 'the highest safety standards in the world.' But while his review was inspired by the Apr. 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform that killed 11 workers and caused a massive oil spill, Oettinger did not call for a Europe-wide ban on deep-sea drilling due to opposition by some countries, notably Britain. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama ended a ban on deepwater drilling amid intense pressure from the oil industry. The six-month moratorium was to end Nov. 30 but that date was moved up with American officials citing new, better safety measures. Oettinger said he will draft EU legislation to upgrade safety on the 1,000 or so offshore oil and gas platforms in the North East Atlantic and more than 100 in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black seas. Current safety rules on those installations are a mishmash of national rules and regulations. In a report to EU governments, Oettinger said the Deepwater Horizon accident must 'lead to a sincere reflection' about the safety of current offshore oil drilling and emergency response measures. He said EU governments should issue new drilling licenses 'in light of the Deepwater Horizon accident.' The EU law he proposed must be endorsed by EU governments and the European Parliament. It would force EU-wide safety standards -- especially for blowout preventers, the parts which failed on the Deepwater Horizon -- on oil and gas companies. The law would also require companies to pay to undo any environmental damage, through insurance policies or own funds, within 200 nautical miles from any coast. Finally, it would require national authorities to supervise platforms but accept final oversight by independent safety experts. After the Gulf of Mexico, the EU reviewed existing safety rules on its oil platforms. While safety standards were found to be high, they vary from one company to another, and legislation differs from one EU nation to another, Oettinger said.

1,"So much of life comes down to bad lighting. Too little, you go blind. Too much, and the flaws become as glaringly obvious as the cockroaches scurrying back under the wallpaper. That said, 'The Tourist' isn't exactly the movie equivalent of a passport picture. But the high wattage of stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie cast the film in a spotlight that would be unflattering for most movies, least of all an insubstantial, tension-free thriller like this. Shot in Paris, Venice and against a few backdrops that seem to have originated in Burbank, 'The Tourist' is based on the 2005 French film 'Anthony Zimmer,' which is a bit odd, since unsuccessful movies don't usually spawn remakes. It's also based on the old mistaken-identity trope, and as such suggests a romantic hybrid like 'To Catch a Thief' (Hitchcock) or 'Charade' (faux-Hitchcock). Suggestion is as far as it gets. Less evocative of a Grace Kelly/Audrey Hepburn heroine than one made out of porcelain, Jolie portrays Elise Clifton-Ward, a woman of profound mystery who has brought her clipped British accent and rather dubious wardrobe to Paris, where she hopes to reconnect with her lover, the master criminal Alexander Pierce. Pierce, it should be noted, communicates with Elise via handwritten messages on monogrammed stationery. Just wanted you to know. One of those notes tells Elise to get on a train to Venice, sidle up to the first guy who vaguely resembles Alexander and thus confuse Scotland Yard and its desperate lead detective, Acheson (Paul Bettany), who has built up a reservoir of hate for the elusive Alexander. When Elise foists herself upon Frank Tupelo (Depp), a kind of dopey junior college math teacher from Wisconsin, Acheson is confused, at first. Most bewildered, of course, is Frank, who suddenly finds himself in the middle of international intrigue. If anyone had asked us, we would have advised Twentieth Century Fox not to put Depp and Jolie together. Both are, if nothing else, decidedly solo acts: Jolie made the recent 'Salt' work, but only because she was allowed to own the entire movie; Depp hasn't played a plausible 21st-century human since 'Secret Window' in 2004. Since then, he has been doing his Keith Richards impersonation in those pirate movies or playing quasi-animated characters for Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam. (He has even lent his voice to 'SpongeBob SquarePants.') Are these performers whom one expects, or even wants, to see uncomfortably cuddling up to each other? No. It's too gruesome. More gruesome, even, than what happens to Frank, who is shot at, arrested, accosted by Russians, dragged through the canals of Venice and threatened with death by the sinister Ivan Demidov (a welcome Steven Berkoff). In the interim, Frank falls in love with Elise. It takes about 47 seconds. We don't buy any of it. Nor do we swallow the counterfeit Euro-stylings of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, the German-born director whose Stasi drama 'The Lives of Others' won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for 2006. Though it may be heretical to say it, given that film's awards pedigree, 'The Lives of Others' was frequently marred by the same cheap sentimentality and emotional shortcuts that hamper 'The Tourist.' In a rather cavalier fashion, von Donnersmarck implies certain qualities without his movie actually creating, inhabiting or working for them - including the nervous tension that should accompany the chase scenes, and the eroticism, however anemic, that might have arisen out of the Depp-Jolie matchup. Frank, for instance, is supposed to be in Italy recovering from the death of his wife. But he apparently finds Elise's attention so therapeutic it's never mentioned again. (This is supposed to happen, of course - if God didn't want Depp and Jolie to get together, he wouldn't have given us Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. But make an effort. Please.) As besotted as he seems to be by his cast, von Donnersmarck is also in thrall to any number of other movies and directors, including 'The French Connection,' from which he borrows Elise's Paris Metro escape, and a dance scene that seems straight out of Gilliam's 'The Fisher King.' Cinema-as-shoplifting is okay, as long as you still get the feeling it's for a greater good. But that's something 'The Tourist' is sorely missing. PG-13. Contains violence and vulgarity. 100 minutes. "
1,"ATLANTA - Virginia Thomas' mistake wasn't so much that she looked up someone from her husband's past to heal lingering pain. 'I would love for you to consider an apology sometime and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband,' Thomas said on the phone message she left at Anita Hill's office at Brandeis University. Taking that call at face value, Virginia Thomas obviously believes Hill lied when she testified that Clarence Thomas relentlessly and vulgarly hit on her when he was her boss at the very agency charged with protecting women against precisely that sort of conduct. It has been 19 years since Hill told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Thomas, as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the 1980s, would speak to her graphically of porn movies and pubic hair, sex organs and sex with animals. He would urge her to go out with him, no matter how often she said no. Virginia Thomas' error was in beginning and ending with a single phone call. If she wants to set the record straight, she should dial up other apparent perjurers, too. She should ask them to clean their consciences of the lies they fed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 to try to keep Thomas off the Supreme Court as puppets of the liberal elite. High on her call list should be Ellen M. Wells, a friend of Hill's who must have lied. She testified that Hill told her about her harassing boss in 1982. So did Susan Hoerchner, another friend of Hill's, who recounted Hill's discomfort over her boss's unwillingness to take no for an answer. He kept saying things like, ''You know I'm your kind of man, you just refuse to admit it,'' Hoerchner said, recounting what Hill told her. Then there was John W. Carr, with whom Hill was involved in a long distance relationship in 1983. According to his testimony, when he asked during one conversation what was troubling her, Hill said her boss 'was making sexual advances toward her. I recall that she was clearly very disturbed by these advances.' Nor should the justice's wife overlook Joel Paul, a law professor at American University. He told the committee that in 1987, when professors at the law school were interested in recruiting Hill, he asked her why she'd left the EEOC. She answered 'reluctantly and with obvious emotion and embarrassment, that she had been sexually harassed by her superior,' Paul testified. When state prosecutors try to corroborate a claim of rape, it helps if the victim made an 'outcry,' or told someone of the attack at the time that it happened. I don't equate rape with sexual come-ons, however unwanted. I mention it because in both cases, an outcry can tip the scales for those trying to decide whether to believe what she said instead of what he said. Perhaps it was all some sort of sexual fantasy that Hill herself believed. That would explain all that outcrying. The 'nutty and slutty' theory was bandied about in the hearing, too. Or maybe it was just part of the liberal effort to deny Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court where he could enshrine his conservative views into high court precedent. Oh, right. Hill worked in the Reagan administration and was an outspoken defender of his views. Well, it's not as if other women came forward with stories of Thomas' sexual predation, right, Mrs. Thomas? Wrong. Angela Wright, who had been Thomas' press secretary at the EEOC (and another conservative Republican) told the Senate staff that Thomas had repeatedly pressured her for dates. He had asked about her breast size and frequently commented on her body and those of other women, she said. One night he showed up at her apartment uninvited and unannounced, and again pressed her to go out with him. Wright, too, cried out. Rose Jourdain, another EEOC employee, told committee staff that Wright had complained to her about Thomas's conduct. Thomas had his defenders, too, some of whom tried to poke holes in Hill's testimony. It was an ugly, painful time for all involved. If I were Clarence Thomas' wife and wanted to finally clear the air, Hill wouldn't have been my first call. I'd first dial up Hoerchner, Wells, Carr, Paul, Wright and Jourdain. I would probably also reach out to the men who knew Thomas in college, law school and later, who confirmed to book authors of Thomas' interest in pornography and his habit of quipping about pubic hair. They, too, corroborated Hill's characterization of him. Once all those other people admitted they lied, then I would contact Hill and urge her to apologize. But if those others stuck to their guns and I still wanted to clear the air, I would dial up Anita Hill, anyway. This is what I would say: 'Please consider my apology for what my husband did to you when you were at the EEOC and when you came forward to tell the truth about him.' And if I were still speaking to my husband, I would tell him to either apologize to Hill, too, or get over it. Be satisfied, I would say. You won lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land where you are a leader in the movement to push American jurisprudence further to the right. And one more thing. Be thankful that some people still believe Anita Hill lied. ^-0-< Ann Woolner is a Bloomberg News columnist. "
1,"Umar Akmal was 100 not out and Sarfraz Ahmed scored an unbeaten 50 as Pakistan A overcame early second-innings batting problems to hold Australia A to a draw in a four-day match that ended Monday. Set 318 off 60 overs for a final-day win, Pakistan A was in trouble at 77-4 and then 109-5 before Akmal and Ahmed combined to get the visitors to 207-5 for a draw. Offspinner Jason Krejza top-scored for Australia A with an unbeaten 101 but took just one wicket in 31 overs. Krejza, who hasn't played a test since being dumped following Australia's December loss to South Africa in Perth, finished with match figures of 1-147 after taking 1-79 from 14 overs on the final day. Ahmed hit Krejza for five consecutive boundaries in his final over to bring up his half-century. Australia A scored 399 and 256-5 declared while Pakistan A scored 338 in its first innings. The teams play a second four-day match beginning Friday, again at Riverway Stadium in Townsville. "
1,"Talk to any Santa Barbara County winemaker, and before long he or she will probably remind you that when you stand on the beach at Santa Barbara and gaze at the Pacific Ocean, you are facing south. And that the Santa Ynez Mountains behind you run west to east, unlike most of California's coastal ranges and river valleys, which are oriented north to south, parallel to the coast. A few miles west of Santa Barbara, where the coast makes a northerly right turn at a promontory that locals fondly call 'Reagan's Nose,' the mountains funnel the cool ocean air and fog inland through the Santa Ynez Valley, moderating the Southern California temperatures and creating ideal conditions for grapes to ripen. The next thing your winemaker friend might tell you is that as you head east from the town of Lompoc, near the ocean, through Buellton, Solvang and Los Olivos (made famous in the 2004 film 'Sideways'), the average temperature rises one degree per mile. That's a dramatic change in the world of wine grapes, and it influences a grower's decision about which grape varieties to plant. Pinot noir and chardonnay thrive at the western, cooler end of the Santa Ynez Valley, a region known as the Santa Rita Hills, while the warmer areas to the west are hospitable to Rhone varieties such as grenache and syrah. The county's other major wine area, the Santa Maria Valley to the north, also benefits from ocean influences guided inland by the San Rafael Mountains. This unique microclimate gives winemakers exceptional fruit to play with, and the best are producing wines of great intensity and focus. During a recent visit to Santa Barbara County, I was particularly impressed with wines from the Santa Rita Hills, a place that received federal recognition as an American Viticultural Area in 2001. (The appellation is spelled Sta. Rita Hills on wine labels, a compromise reached with the Santa Rita wine empire of Chile.) The SRH, as winemakers also call it, stretches west to east between Lompoc and Buellton. Its northern border follows State Route 246; at the southern end is the Santa Rosa Road, twisting among the canyons of the Santa Ynez Mountains, where it is not uncommon to drive around an outcropping of rock and brush and be confronted with acres of stunning hillside vineyards. Richard Longoria makes wine with grapes from throughout the county, including pinot noir from Fe Ciega Vineyard in the SRH and Spanish varietals such as albari o and tempranillo from the warmer end of the Santa Ynez Valley, about 25 miles to the east. The grapes' expression varies from region to region, he said. 'In the Santa Maria Valley, pinot noir has a more pronounced herbal quality, with red-fruit flavors. In the Santa Rita Hills, pinot has more of a black-fruit character,' he said. Think blackberries instead of strawberries or plums. Greg Brewer makes some of the best chardonnay and pinot noir in the Santa Rita Hills. His wines _ whether under his Brewer-Clifton label; under the label of Melville winery, where he is the winemaker; or under his own separate label called Diatom _ pulse with energy and somehow convey a sense of purity. Brewer credits his minimalist winemaking style. For his chardonnay, he uses either non- oak or neutral (used) barrels, and he avoids malolactic fermentation and lees stirring, two techniques that yield California chardonnay's traditional rich, buttery profile. 'I get a lot of inspiration from sushi chefs,' Brewer said. 'They say that every time you touch the fish, you take something away from it. Stirring the lees would be like banging the fish against the table.' (Begin optional add end) Richard Sanford of Alma Rosa Winery is celebrating his 40th year as a winemaker in the Santa Rita Hills. And though he makes some of the region's best chardonnay and pinot noir, he is also producing some top-notch pinot blanc, an underappreciated variety wherever it is grown. Like Brewer, Sanford expressed a Zenlike appreciation for his wine. 'I like the emptiness pinot blanc has, with a modest varietal flavor,' Sanford said as we tasted his pinot blanc from the Santa Rita Hills. He was the one being modest. The wine seemed pretty mouth-filling and delicious to me. "
1,"Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany won a surprise gold medal in the Olympic giant slalom on Thursday, with the first-run leaders slowed by dense fog. Rebensburg, who had never won a major race, won in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 27.11 seconds. Tina Maze of Slovenia was second, 0.12 seconds behind, matching her result in super-G, and first-run leader Elisabeth Goergl of Austria added another bronze, 0.49 back, duplicating her downhill finish. The 20-year-old Rebensburg stood only sixth after the opening leg. Defending champion Julia Mancuso of the United States finished eighth. The first run of the race was held Wednesday, but dense fog forced organizers to postpone the second leg for a day. There was more fog Thursday, and it got worse just after Rebensburg's run. Rebensburg's best previous result was second in the last World Cup GS before the Vancouver Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Before that, she had never finished on the podium. Like the first leg Wednesday, organizers again rushed to get the race in, sending down racers at 60- and 75-second intervals -- meaning there were often two skiers on the course at a time -- and abandoning TV breaks before the first 30 racers came down and the medals were decided. The short intervals created problems in the first leg, with Mancuso's first trip down interrupted because teammate Lindsey Vonn crashed out immediately before her -- breaking her right little finger. Mancuso had to be brought back up for another try and eventually placed 18th in the opening leg. The Californian had the third-fastest second run to move up 10 spots in the final standings. The race was briefly interrupted after 18 skiers came down due to an apparent timing equipment problem. Only one more women's race remains on the Alpine schedule, Friday's slalom. "
1,"Gunmen ambushed two police vehicles at a busy intersection in Ciudad Juarez on Friday, killing six officers and a 17-year-old girl who was passing by, authorities said. Chihuahua state spokesman Enrique Torres Valadez said five of the six police officers were federal, and one was municipal. Authorities said the police officers in the vehicles were distracted by someone selling items on the street when the gunmen opened fire. The assailants then fled in three vehicles. Investigators said they don't know why the officers were shot, although they don't believe they were targeted because of any recent arrests they had made. No one has been arrested but police said they have recovered two of the three cars used in the shooting. Ciudad Juarez is one of the world's deadliest cities, and a two-year turf battle between drug cartels has left more than 5,000 people dead. Elsewhere, police in Guerrero said they found the bodies of five men who had been shot to death lying on a dirt road near Chilpancingo, the capital of the Pacific coast state. Three of the men were brothers, all in their 20s. The state has been a major battleground for warring cartels, including the Beltran Leyva gang, but it was not clear whether the shootings were part of the ongoing drug violence. In Morelos state, federal police and the Mexican army raided two ranch homes and arrested 15 men near the town of Amacuzac. Those arrested were taken to Mexico City in a helicopter. The men are suspected of working for Jose Gerardo Alvarez Vazquez, who was arrested in Mexico City on Wednesday, said Ramon Pequeno, the head of the anti-narcotics division of Mexico's federal police. Pequeno said the men provided security and carried out killings for Alvarez Vazquez and his partner Edgar Valdez Villarreal, a U.S.-born enforcer known as 'La Barbie.' Authorities say Alvarez Vazquez and Valdez Villareal are battling for control of the Beltran Leyva cartel. An estimated 22,700 people have been killed in Mexico's drug war since December 2006. "
1,"A 16-year-old Australian who spent seven months at sea in her pink yacht sailed across the finish line of her round-the-world journey Saturday, becoming the youngest sailor to circle the globe solo, nonstop and unassisted. Thousands of spectators erupted into cheers as Jessica Watson sailed into Sydney Harbour, the finale to an epic adventure in which she battled 40-foot (12-meter) waves, homesickness and critics who said she'd never make it home alive. 'She said she'd sail around the world, and she has,' a tearful Julie Watson said as she watched her grinning daughter cruise past the finish line from a nearby boat. 'She's home.' Watson docked at Sydney's iconic Opera House. The teenager burst into tears and gasped in relief as she stepped off the yacht and into the arms of her parents, whose decision to let their daughter attempt the feat was called an act of insanity by critics. She hung onto her father and brother as she walked slowly and tentatively along a pink carpet rolled out in her honor -- her first steps on land in 210 days. Fans screamed and waved as she walked by, many wearing pink clothes and holding pink flags in a nod to her 34-foot (10-meter) yacht, Ella's Pink Lady. 'People don't think you're capable of these things -- they don't realize what young people, what 16-year-olds and girls are capable of,' Watson told the raucous crowd. 'It's amazing when you take away those expectations what you can do.' Watson, from Buderim, north of Brisbane in Queensland state, sailed out of Sydney on Oct. 18 despite protests by critics that she was too immature and inexperienced for the treacherous journey. Her parents maintained that she was well-prepared and noted she has been sailing since the age of 8. 'I don't think any of us would ever doubt Jessica Watson again,' said New South Wales state Premier Kristina Keneally, who greeted Watson at the Opera House. Watson's journey took her northeast through the South Pacific and across the equator, south to Cape Horn at the tip of South America, across the Atlantic Ocean to South Africa, through the Indian Ocean and around southern Australia. Australian Jesse Martin holds the current record for the youngest person to sail around the world solo, nonstop and unassisted, after he completed the journey in 1999 at the age of 18. Martin boarded Watson's boat to take over during her cruise toward the Opera House, so she could relax and wave to fans. Watson was given a goodie bag that included a can of whipped cream, which she partially injected into her mouth before laughing and turning away from the cameras. She was also joined on board by Britain's Mike Perham, who completed a solo circumnavigation at the age of 17 in 2009, though technical problems forced him to stop for assistance. Watson's feat, however, will not be considered an official world record, because the World Speed Sailing Record Council discontinued its 'youngest' category. And though she sailed nearly 23,000 nautical miles, some sailing enthusiasts have also argued that Watson didn't travel far enough north of the equator for her journey to count as a true round-the-world sail as defined by the record council's rules. Watson's managers have dismissed those claims and argued she doesn't need to adhere to the council's rules anyway, since they won't be recognizing her voyage. The route took Watson through some of the world's most treacherous waters, and the teen battled through monstrous storms, suffering seven knockdowns. Watson said she had moments of doubt during those times, but generally kept her spirits up. 'Amazingly, I just enjoyed it much, much more than I ever thought I would and handled the challenges better than I thought,' she told journalists. 'You don't actually have a choice -- you're in the middle of a storm, you're being knocked down -- you can't fall apart.' But her journey was also peppered with moments of beauty. On her blog, she described stunning sunrises over glassy seas, the excitement of spotting a blue whale and the dazzling, eerie sight of a shooting star racing across the night sky above her boat. She also had fun, chatting about boys and fashion with 'Silly,' a little brown seabird that landed on her yacht and hung around for awhile. She sang at the top of her lungs with no audience to critique her and indulged her sweet tooth with chocolate cupcakes she baked in her tiny kitchen. A video she shot shows her giggling while dumping a ceremonial bucket of saltwater over her head after crossing the equator. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd greeted Watson at the Opera House with a grin and a hug, dubbing her 'Australia's newest hero' -- a description Watson dismissed. 'I'm actually going to disagree with the Prime Minister,' she said, as the crowd laughed. 'I don't consider myself a hero. I'm an ordinary girl who believed in her dream.' ---------- Online: "
1,"There's been a lot of talk about rules on Capitol Hill lately. On Wednesday, Republicans found themselves in violation of the Kenny Rogers Rule: Know when to fold 'em. Health-care reform, love it or hate it, is now a done deal, and the finishing touches were on their way to final passage in the Senate on Wednesday night by a comfortable margin. Fanatics across the country, no doubt fired up by Republican lawmakers' overheated cries of 'tyranny' and 'baby killer,' have begun vandalizing Democratic offices and making death threats against Democratic office-holders. This would be a good time for sensible lawmakers to say 'basta.' But basta is not in Sen. Tom Coburn's vocabulary. The Republican from Oklahoma proposed no fewer than 11 amendments on Wednesday to try to trip up the last piece of the bill. No. 1 on his list? Amendment 3556 to H.R. 4872: 'No Erectile Dysfunction Drugs to Sex Offenders.' 'If this bill goes through without this amendment, your tax dollars are going to be paying for Viagra for child molesters,' Coburn, a medical doctor, said on the Senate floor as he introduced his E.D. rider. The Levitra legislation did not get a rise out of Democrats. 'Offering an amendment dealing with Viagra for rapists?' Majority Leader Harry Reid asked, struggling for words. 'I mean, this is _ this _ this is _ this isn't serious.' Even Reid, D-Nev., probably doesn't favor sex-offender Cialis, but Democrats had no choice but to lay this one on the table. The adoption of any amendment, even one that would prevent rapists from getting help for erectile dysfunction, would doom the whole thing, and the majority was determined to vote each one down. Hence the attempt to amend the health-care bill with a proposal to force the District of Columbia to have a referendum on same-sex marriage _ the brainchild of Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah _ and the amendment by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., requiring the government to de-fund the now-defunct ACORN. The shenanigans spread beyond the floor. For the second day in a row, Republicans employed procedural objections to block committees from meeting. The five hearings canceled Wednesday included one by the Armed Services Committee to take testimony from military commanders who had flown in from South Korea, Hawaii and Nebraska _ and now had to twiddle their thumbs. The committee chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., went to the floor to urge the Republicans to relent. He pointed out that Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the top Republican on the panel , joined in the plea. 'I would have to object,' responded Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. Levin took his case to the press gallery. 'The idea that the Republicans, out of pique, would deny us the opportunity to have this hearing,' he said 'is pointless and blind obstructionism. ... This has nothing to do with health care. It has everything to do with the security of this nation.' Republicans also shut down a Homeland Security subcommittee hearing on police training in Afghanistan. The chairman of that panel, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., went to the floor to vent. 'Somebody has got to explain this to me,' she demanded. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va. didn't wait for an explanation. He and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. 'went rogue,' as McCaskill put it, ignoring the objections and holding their subcommittee hearing anyway. But other objections from opponents of the health-care legislation can't be so easily ignored, because they're coming in the form of hurled objects. Bricks were reportedly thrown through windows in Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter's office in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Similar incidents occurred in Arizona, Kansas and Ohio. In Virginia, a gas line was cut to the home of the brother of Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Va. after a conservative activist posted the address online, mistakenly thinking it was the congressman's house. Democratic leaders said 10 lawmakers had been offered increased security after various death threats, including the image of gallows and a noose sent to the office of Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The hanging apparatus had Stupak's name on it and the drawing had the message: 'All baby killers come to unseemly ends.' Stupak was the anti-abortion Democrat on the House floor when Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Tex., shouted 'baby killer.' House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, issued a statement Wednesday urging people to register their objections 'the right way.' That's a nice thought, but if Boehner were serious about cooling tempers, he could have stopped members of his caucus from going onto the House balcony during Sunday's health-care debate, waving flags and posters and pumping their fists in the air to rile up demonstrators. He might also have some words with the Republican National Committee, which, even after Democrats complained, continued on Wednesday to operate a Web site, FireNancyPelosi.com, showing an image of the House speaker surrounded by flames. If Republican lawmakers really want their supporters to cool it, they'll have to calm themselves. Maybe Dr. Coburn, after his brave stand on Viagra, can prescribe his colleagues some Xanax. "
1,"Congressional demands for an investigation are growing over new disclosures that a secret CIA program to capture or kill al-Qaida leaders was concealed from the U.S. Congress for eight years, perhaps at the behest of former Vice President Dick Cheney. The program, which never got off the ground and remains shrouded in mystery, was designed to target leaders of the terrorism network at close range, rather than with air strikes that risked civilian casualties, government officials with knowledge of the operation said Monday. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The program was canceled last month by CIA Director Leon Panetta shortly after he himself first learned of it. Some Democratic lawmakers suggested the failure to notify the congressional intelligence committees violated the oversight laws, which require the intelligence community to keep Congress informed of its activities. The leader of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said that House and Senate intelligence committees should 'take whatever actions they believe are necessary to get more information on the subject,' including whether Cheney played a direct role in proposing the secret program and withholding information from Congress. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, joining the ranks of those calling for a thorough investigation, said, 'Individuals who ordered that Congress be kept in the dark should be held accountable.' Feingold said he had 'deep concerns about the program itself,' adding that he had written to President Barack Obama to ask for the probe. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat and the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has said that being kept in the dark by the CIA broke the law and 'should never, ever happen again.' But defenders of Cheney suggested that no laws were broken because the counterterrorism program never got beyond the talking stage. However, the issue might come down to whether any tax dollars were spent on the planning -- and thus subject to congressional scrutiny. It presented a delicate dilemma for the Obama administration, which so far has steered clear of joining congressional calls for thoroughly investigating controversial intelligence-community actions under President George W. Bush and Cheney and prosecuting those who broke the law. Robert Gibbs, Obama's spokesman, continued on this careful path on Monday, saying Panetta was reviewing how keeping the information from congressional intelligence leaders 'came to pass and I think that's wise.' 'The president believes that Congress should always be briefed fully and in a timely manner in accordance with the law. Those are his beliefs as it relates to any of these programs,' Gibbs said. As to a related controversy, reports that Attorney General Eric Holder may be leaning toward having a criminal prosecutor look into whether U.S. interrogators tortured terror suspects, Gibbs repeated Obama's earlier statement that 'our efforts are better focused looking forward than looking back.' Gibbs said the president as well as the attorney general and others in the administration 'all agree that anyone who followed the law, that was acting in the good faith of the guidance that they were provided within the four corners of the law, will not and should not be prosecuted.' Panetta canceled the CIA program on June 23 after learning of its existence, its failure to yield results, and the fact that Congress had been unaware of it since its inception soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, according to one official with direct knowledge of the plan. That official said Bush authorized killing al-Qaida leaders and that Congress was made aware of that. However, the official said, Panetta also told members of Congress that, according to notes that he had been given on the early months of the program, Cheney directed the CIA not to inform Congress of the specifics of the secret program. Panetta told the committees there was no indication that there was anything illegal or inappropriate about the effort itself, the official said. CIA directors since 2001 agreed with Cheney's decision not to inform Congress because the highly classified operation, described as 'sporadic' and 'embryonic,' never managed to turn up the intelligence needed to carry out a kill and was not considered a covert operation, according to a former intelligence official. That official also was not authorized to discuss the program and spoke on condition of anonymity. Congress has a right to know everything the CIA does, but the president can by law limit those told about covert operations to just the top four members of the House and Senate from the two parties and the senior members of the intelligence committees. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are pushing for a legal provision that would require the president to brief both committees in their entirety more often, but the White House has threatened to veto the move. Most attempts to kill al-Qaida's leaders, believed to be hiding in Pakistan's troubled western border region, use armed drone aircraft because it is difficult terrain controlled by sometimes hostile tribes. But those strikes have sometimes killed and injured innocent civilians and caused outrage in Pakistan. The government official said the CIA effort was meant to avoid such collateral damage. ------ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville and Jim Abrams contributed to this report. "
1,"Interest rates are rising in the bond market after a fresh batch of economic data shows that the economy continues to slowly regain its strength. A government report Thursday shows inflation at the consumer level remains tame, while another says weekly jobless claims fell. A third reports the economy is likely to continue to grow, albeit slowly. The slightly positive news is draining some cash out of Treasurys. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note maturing in February 2020 rose to 3.67 percent in trading Thursday from 3.64 percent late Wednesday. Its price fell 9/32 to 99 18/32. The yield of the 10-year note is linked to interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans. "

1,"Just weeks before an international conference on climate change, the United Nations signaled Monday it was scaling back expectations of reaching agreement on a new treaty to slow global warning. Janos Pasztor, director of the secretary-general's Climate Change Support Team, said 'it's hard to say how far the conference will be able to go' because the U.S. Congress has not agreed on a climate bill, and industrialized nations have not agreed on targets to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions or funding to help developing countries limit their discharges. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made a new climate treaty his top priority, hosting a Sept. 22 summit on climate change to spur political support and traveling extensively to build political momentum for a global agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which only requires 37 industrialized nations to cut emissions. Pasztor told a news conference 'there is tremendous activity by governments in capitals and internationally to shape the outcome' of the climate change conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in early December, which 'is a good development' because political leadership is essential to make a deal. But he indicated that Copenhagen most likely won't produce a treaty, but instead will push governments as far as they can go on the content of an agreement. 'The secretary-general believes that we must maintain the political momentum established by the 101 heads of state and government who attended the climate change summit and continue to aim for an ambitious, politically binding agreement in Copenhagen that would chart the way for future post-Copenhagen negotiations that lead to a legally binding global agreement,' Pasztor said. He stressed that there is still a final negotiating session in Barcelona, Spain, from Nov. 2-6 that will be followed by two more weeks of work in Copenhagen. The secretary-general is in close contact with the Danish prime minister and might go to the meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in Singapore on Nov. 14-15 -- which President Barack Obama plans to attend -- to keep pressing for a global accord in Copenhagen, Pasztor said. Obama attended the U.N. climate summit, and this week the Senate environment committee will take up its version of a global warming bill which would cut greenhouse gases by about 80 percent by 2050 and require more domestic energy to come from renewable sources. But with work still to be done on health care and deep divisions in Congress over how to deal with climate change, chances the Senate will pass a climate bill by the end of the year are slim. Pasztor said a U.S. climate bill is very important because without one, U.S. negotiators in Copenhagen can't negotiate on targets for emissions reductions. He said two key unresolved issues are agreement on emission reduction targets for industrialized countries and how to finance actions by developing countries to limit their emissions growth and adapt to the effects of climate change. Developed countries want to provide money for specific actions to curb emissions -- but developing countries say the actions depend on how much money they're going to get, Pasztor said, and that still hasn't been decided.

1,"A spate of bombings killed two Iraqi pilgrims Thursday as they headed to ceremonies to mark a Shiite Muslim day of mourning. Police said four bombs hidden in trash cans killed two people in a procession and wounded six in the town of Dujail, 50 miles (80 kilometers) miles north of Baghdad. The casualties were confirmed by Dr. Munthir Hussein of the Hussein hospital in Dujail. Two more bombs were discovered and disarmed before they exploded, said a local police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. Earlier, a roadside bomb wounded three pilgrims in the downtown Baghdad neighborhood of Karradah, police said. Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq are headed to the holy Shiite city of Karbala for Ashoura, which marks the seventh century death of Imam Hussein in a killing that sealed Islam's historic Sunni-Shiite split. More than 1 million Shiites are expected to converge on Karbala, south of Baghdad, for Ashoura's peak on Friday. Many of the pilgrims march on foot to Karbala, and are frequently targeted by Sunni insurgents who seek to re-ignite sectarian violence in Iraq. In a separate attack, gunmen fatally shot a senior official in Iraq's Education Ministry and his wife after blocking his car while they were driving in a Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, city police and morgue officials said.

1,"Irwin Silber, who helped spark a resurgence of interest in American folk music during the 1950s and '60s with Sing Out!, the magazine he founded and edited for nearly two decades, and who publicly feuded over politics with folk singers Bob Dylan and Burl Ives, died Sept. 8 at an extended-care facility in Oakland, Calif. He was 84 and had Alzheimer's disease. Silber was a committed leftist and a onetime member of the Communist Party for whom music was an important political tool. In 1950, he joined forces with two like-minded partners, the musician Pete Seeger and musicologist Alan Lomax, to launch Sing Out!, a magazine about folk music that also served as a voice of dissent against Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., and others leading a witch hunt into alleged communist subversion in politics and entertainment. The magazine's name comes from the lyrics of 'If I Had a Hammer,' a tune co- written in 1949 by Seeger and Lee Hays that became a universal protest anthem. In its first five years, the New York-based Sing Out! published about 400 new songs and old favorites, and it was the first to print such classics as Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land' and 'Rock Island Line,' written by Kelly Pace and made famous by Lead Belly. As time went on, Silber embraced a broader and more diverse repertoire, publishing traditional African and Asian songs, gospel music and even Beethoven. With Silber at its helm, Sing Out! helped drive the folk music renaissance in the 1960s, as acoustic guitars and finely spun harmonies became instruments of the anti-Vietnam War counterculture. The magazine's early coverage of singers including Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Dylan helped launch them to national prominence. Silber served as editor until 1967, by which time the magazine's circulation had topped 25,000. He was a leading gatekeeper of the folk establishment, using his platform in Sing Out! both to highlight musical developments and reinforce the movement's left-leaning politics. Forceful and occasionally abrasive, he skewered those who he believed had abandoned their principles. He reprimanded Dylan for departing from his roots as a politically motivated singer, writing in 1964 that the folk star's 'new songs seem to be all inner- directed now, inner-probing, self-conscious.' Folk music observers have said Silber inspired Dylan's song 'Positively Fourth Street,' whose lyrics read: 'You say I let you down. You know it's not like that./If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?' Another of Silber's targets was Ives, who voluntarily appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 1952 to dispel rumors that he was a Communist sympathizer. Ives named four closet Communists working in the music business, and Silber pounced. 'The well-known folksinger, who once joined in singing `Solidarity Forever,' has a different tune today. It might be called `Ballad for Stoolpigeons,' ' he wrote of Ives. 'The future of Burl Ives should be interesting. We've never seen anyone sing while crawling on his belly before.' Irwin Silber was born Oct. 17, 1925, to Jewish working-class parents in New York. He was a camper and then a counselor at a Marxist summer camp in New Jersey called Camp Wo-Chi-Ca and was a member of the Young Communist League. After graduating from Brooklyn College in 1945, he went to work for People's Songs, an organization that used a quarterly magazine, Bulletin, to promote music as a force for workers in their struggle for more rights and better treatment. Sing Out! grew out of People's Songs, which folded in the late 1940s. Silber's first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to the former Sylvia Kahn. Survivors include his wife of 33 years, jazz singer Barbara Dane of Oakland; three children from his second marriage, Frederic Silber of Redmond, Wash., Joshua Silber of New York and Nina Silber of Needham, Mass.; three stepchildren, Jesse Cahn of Luther, Okla., Pablo Menendez of Havana and Nina Menendez of Oakland; four grandchildren; and a great-grandson. After his tenure at Sing Out!, Silber became executive editor of the Guardian, a radical weekly publication. He also wrote several books, including 'Socialism: What Went Wrong?' and, more recently, 'A Patient's Guide to Knee and Hip Replacement.' "
1,"Bob Franks, 58, who served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1990s as a Republican from northern New Jersey, died April 9 of cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was a powerful figure in New Jersey's resurgent Republican Party, and twice served as the state's GOP chairman and as a congressional campaign manager. He spent 14 years in the state legislature, as a protege of Gov. Thomas Kean, before being elected to Congress from New Jersey's 7th Congressional District in 1992. Franks was fiscally conservative and socially liberal, favoring abortion rights. He was a member of the House Transportation Committee and supported overhauling campaign finance rules. In 2000, Franks narrowly lost a race for the U.S. Senate against Jon S. Corzine, who heavily outspent his Republican opponent. Franks lost a bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 2001. He then became director of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a lobbying group for pharmaceutical and medical technology companies. Robert Douglas Franks was born in Hackensack, N.J., and graduated from DePauw University in Indiana. He received a law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1976, then returned to New Jersey to work as a political consultant. He and Corzine eventually became good friends, and Franks became a frequent consultant to the Democratic senator, who later became New Jersey's governor. Survivors include his wife, Fran Franks, and three daughters. "
1,"To educate people about a 160-year-old story _ the largest recorded slave escape attempt in American history _ the Pearl Coalition thinks it has found the perfect learning tool: a schooner the same size as the slaves' original getaway boat. The only problem: The vessel is stuck in El Salvador awaiting $300,000 in repairs before it can sail to its new home in the District of Columbia. 'The story of the Pearl is classic. It is the American dream at its best,' said David Smith, executive director of the coalition. 'It is something to be proud of.' On April 15, 1848, more than 70 slaves from Maryland, the District and Virginia gathered at the Seventh Street pier in Southeast Washington and boarded the Pearl, hoping it could take them to freedom. Stormy weather left them stalled in the Chesapeake Bay long enough to be recaptured, but the attempt brought fame to some of the passengers and buoyed the abolition movement. 'Freedom might have been geographically close, but a very different thing to achieve,' said Mary Kay Ricks, an author of a book on the Pearl's history. 'It was an event that shook Washington. It shook Congress.' The Pearl Coalition was originally formed by Lloyd Smith, David Smith's grandfather and a District planner and community leader. Robert Nixon, a member of the board, was one of those who took up Smith's dream after he died in 2004. 'The original vision of Lloyd Smith was this story empowering the men and women of Washington, D.C. I think that is why we are working so hard to bring this story back,' Nixon said. 'This tactile piece, floating piece of history that everyone can participate in and celebrate.' The ship's reincarnation, dubbed 'The Spirit of the Pearl,' has been en route since last year, when Nixon and his friend Maxwell Kennedy _ an author, lawyer and son of Robert F. and Ethel Kennedy _ found it in San Francisco. Its engine was replaced and other major repairs were made in Monterey Bay before it was moved to the mouth of the Lempa River in El Salvador. But for the 80-year-old ship to make it to a site on the Washington waterfront before hurricane season, it will need new decking, masts, rigging, sails and more. Smith would like to start a program in which youths would learn hands-on skills of carpentry and boat-making while repairing The Spirit of the Pearl in El Salvador. Once the boat arrives in the District, those youths could work to get the vessel ready for educational cruises for schoolchildren and tourists. 'The idea that (from) every single bridge, when you cross over the Potomac you will see the flag flying from the top mast of this vessel and people are going to have to say, `What is that?' ' said Kennedy, the coalition's captain. 'People are going to have to learn this story.' "
1,"Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Monday that he wants a political solution to a showdown with antigovernment protesters, signaling he may dissolve parliament and hold elections earlier than previously suggested. 'I, the government and coalition parties have been working together to revise proposals discussed prior to announcing the emergency decree, in an attempt to find a political solution,' Abhisit said in a televised address. A senior military official said elections may be the only way to end the stalemate. Abhisit's comments came after month-long protests in Bangkok erupted into violence over the weekend, killing 21 people and injuring more than 800. Demonstrators, many of them loyal to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, remained camped in two areas of the capital, vowing to stay until Abhisit agrees to early elections. Earlier this month he proposed dissolving parliament at the end of the year. The benchmark stock index fell the most in six months Monday. Pressure to accommodate the demonstrators came from the military, as Army chief Anupong Paojinda called for parliament to be dismissed and new elections called. 'Political problems need to be resolved by political means,' Anupong said at a briefing Monday. 'I believe that a house dissolution should be the answer.' The government's coalition partners support a proposal to dissolve parliament by October, Somsak Prisananthakul, an adviser for the Chart Thai Pattana Party, said by phone Monday. Abhisit's opponents earlier this month rejected his offer to call an election within nine months, demanding he step down before the Thai New Year holiday, which starts Tuesday. 'We will continue our demonstration until Abhisit dissolves the parliament,' Jaran Ditapichai, a protest leader, said Monday by phone. 'It might take another week. Tomorrow many people may go home and we are worried the government will try again to order the army to disperse us.' The government and security forces are cooperating to protect the safety of the public, Anupong and Defense Minister Profit Wongsuwan said at a joint briefing Monday, denying rumors of a rift. They said troops didn't use live rounds during the April 10 clashes, blaming the violence on a third group that infiltrated the rally armed with guns and grenades. Protesters, many of whom wear red shirts to distinguish themselves from the political rivals, rejected calls to restart negotiations with the government. Their stance raises concerns that the worst political violence since 1992, when more than 40 people were killed in four days of fighting, may be repeated. 'Red Shirt leaders, whose bargaining position has been fortified by the security debacles on Friday and Saturday, will be less likely to compromise on important points and would likely reject an offer of elections six months hence,' PSA Asia, a Bangkok-based security and risk assessment consulting firm, said in a note to clients Monday. Troops and protesters maintained a cease-fire in Bangkok. Demonstrators are in makeshift camps near Government House and in the tourist and shopping heartland, where they are occupying a major intersection. Parts of the city's elevated train system, known as the skytrain, remained closed for a third day. 'We will not retreat from protest areas,' Nattawut Saikuar, a protest leader, said at a camp in Bangkok's commercial district. 'We will continue to fight here.' With assistance from Daniel Ten Kate, Suttinee Yuvejwattana and Yumi Teso in Bangkok. "
1,"Glenn Beck fans are not going to like our colleague Dana Milbank's new book about the tea party favorite, 'Tears of a Clown.' Little reason they should, since the book is a 257-page skewering. But for those who don't watch Beck regularly, or have never even seen his Fox News show, the book is a look - albeit sharply negative - at the meteoric rise of someone who's developed a massive following of millions of viewers and devotees. With his show and his best-selling books, Beck, just coming off that huge rally on the Mall, is undeniably one of the most influential people in America today. So attention must be paid. Milbank concludes that 'the fury, the violent talk, the shouting - in short the craziness' on television are 'all for show.' Indeed, the opening chapter finds Beck in a photo shoot at which the makeup woman is rubbing menthol under his eyes to induce that famous crying. But surely Beck, despite estimated revenue of around $30 million a year, is a very worried man. 'If you paid attention,' as songwriter Randy Newman sings, 'you'd be worried, too.' And Beck is very worried - in a panic, in fact - about most everything, Milbank writes: Nazis, commies, President Obama, all manner of conspiracies, the collapse of the economy, and especially Woodrow Wilson, president during the progressive era, who left office 90 years ago. Beck blames Wilson for most of today's problems. (Kind of like the way ultra-liberals fixate on the last Whig president, Millard Fillmore.) Most of all, Beck worries that the end, doomsday, is coming, soon, and it won't be pretty. (Which is why he opposes Obama spending on infrastructure projects. After all, why bother?) His worries about a violent national collapse have even attracted survivalist advertisers on the show. One of them touts a 'Survival Seed Bank,' in case 'the politicians and the bankers . . . bring the whole thing crashing down.' 'In an economic meltdown,' the commercial says, 'non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than even silver and gold.' So, for just $149, plus '$15 for shipping and handling,' you'll get the 'ultimate barter item,' the 'perfect mix of germination-tested non-hybrid seeds,' enough 'to plant a full-acre crisis garden.' Best of all, the 'indestructible survival seed bank can be buried to avoid confiscation.' Tune in or record the show, which airs weekdays at 5 p.m. EDT on the Fox News Channel. Then maybe you'll be worried, too. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Teleworking for federal employees took a major step forward with legislation approved by the Senate on Wednesday night. Under the legislation, agencies would develop policies allowing all employees to work remotely unless their positions are specifically excluded. Telework would become part of an agency's contingency plans for situations, such as the snowstorms that closed federal facilities in Washington last winter, when work could not be done in regular offices. Each agency also would create the post of telework managing officer to oversee its teleworking program. The legislation would create telework travel test programs, including one for the Patent and Trademark Office. 'I am pleased the Senate passed the compromise telework bill, which I believe contains the best of the House and Senate bills,' said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, a sponsor of the legislation. 'It will improve the lives of federal workers by expanding telework opportunities, and it will help agencies attract and retain top talent. This bill will help keep critical government functions running in the event of snowstorms or other emergencies.' But a provision that provided teeth in an earlier version of the legislation was not included in the bill passed by the Senate. That provision would have allowed employees to telework 20 percent of the time in each two-week period. The Obama administration and employee organizations have pushed for greater teleworking opportunities for employees. The inability or unwillingness of supervisors to manage staff members they can't see has long been cited as a major reason so few federal employees now telework on a regular basis. Less than 10 percent of federal employees eligible to telework did so in 2008, according to the latest 'Status of Telework in the Federal Government' report to Congress by the Office of Personnel Management. The bill attempts to address institutional reluctance through training. 'Employing telework on a government-wide scale constitutes a significant culture shift in the federal workforce, one that requires an increased investment in managerial training to maintain employee engagement, monitor performance and promote cooperation when face-to-face communication is restricted,' said Patricia Niehaus, president of the Federal Managers Association. Telework now returns to the House, which passed a different version of the legislation in July. _ _ _ The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wants the Government Accountability Office to examine the operation of the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program. In a letter to the GAO, Rep. Edolphus 'Ed' Towns, D-N.Y., questioned the 'retained asset accounts' method the program uses to disburse money due a beneficiary. The program is administered by MetLife insurance company and overseen by the Office of Personnel Management. John Calagna, a MetLife vice president, said the company believes the accounts, which it calls Total Control Accounts (TCA) 'are equal to or more favorable than receiving a check in virtually every scenario. Since TCAs are fully liquid on- demand accounts, TCA account holders have immediate access to the full amount of their life insurance benefits.' These accounts are basically low-interest bank accounts, but they are not insured by the federal government, as regular bank accounts are, though they are protected by state programs, according to Calagna. Instead of giving lump sum payments directly to the beneficiaries, the money is held in an account until the beneficiary withdraws it. The deposits earn interest, but MetLife keeps a far greater portion of that interest than that paid to the beneficiaries, according to the committee. 'It appears that MetLife is paying itself a much higher interest rate on the money in these accounts than the interest they pay to the account holder. To many people that does not seem fair,' Towns said in a press statement. 'Furthermore, I am concerned that some beneficiaries may not fully understand their right to obtain immediate, lump-sum payment of their benefits.' About half of the accounts earn 3 percent interest and 80 percent earn 1.5 percent or better, according to Calagna. _ _ _ Uncle Sam can make things so convoluted that Congress this week approved legislation requiring him to be plain-spoken. The legislation directs agencies to train employees on how to write plainly and appoint a plain-writing official to oversee implementation of the measure. Plain writing is defined as 'writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience.' That's going to require a huge change in practice for many agencies. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, sponsor of the legislation, said 'writing government documents in plain language will increase government accountability and will save Americans time and money. Plain, straightforward language makes it easy for taxpayers to understand what the federal government is doing and what services it is offering.' "
1,"Joe Kaeser was six months into his new job as chief financial officer of Siemens in November 2006, and already, he had a list of accomplishments to show for it. The executive had helped to arrange a joint venture between Siemens and Nokia that combined their telecommunications- network units, guided Siemens in completing its largest U.S. bond offering and converted the company's financial statements to international standards. What Kaeser, 52, a Siemens employee for his whole working life, didn't know was that he was about to face his toughest challenge yet. On Nov. 15, 2006, police raided Munich-based Siemens's corporate offices as part of a probe into alleged bribery and kickbacks that would eventually spread to 12 countries. Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld stepped down in 2007 after the company's board indicated it wouldn't renew his contract. He wasn't charged with wrongdoing. Siemens, a manufacturing bellwether whose products range from power turbines to medical scanners and whose operations span the globe, ended up pleading guilty to violating provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paying $1.6 billion in fines to U.S. and German regulators. Kaeser was never charged with wrongdoing. As a member of Siemens's management, he was initially under suspicion, he says. After an independent investigation conducted on behalf of the Siemens audit committee found he had no involvement in the scheme, he was able to help review and fix the company's books going back to 1999. 'That was quite a rough time,' Kaeser said in a Feb. 9 interview at the company's New York office. 'It was a very dark chapter of Siemens history,' he says. 'Looking back now, I probably would feel compelled to say it was a blessing for Siemens that it got caught then and that this company had the opportunity and the chance to turn everything around and close that one for good.' Shareholders approved a settlement between the company and nine former executives in connection with the probe in January. Under the deal, the executives, including former CEO Kleinfeld, would pay the company damages for failing to halt a culture of using bribes in order to win contracts, largely ending the ordeal for Siemens. Two former managers are scheduled to stand trial in a Munich court next week over allegations of breach of trust and aiding bribery. Kaeser's challenge now is to bolster profits at the company as the global economy recovers from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Bavarian-born Kaeser, who joined Siemens in 1980 in the company's components group, works closely with CEO Peter Loescher, a former Merck manager who became the first outsider to head Siemens when he was hired in 2007 following Kleinfeld's departure. Loescher, 52, changed Siemens's structure to focus on three main divisions -- industrial, health care and energy -- and replaced half of the company's top 100 executives. The restructuring reduced costs, enabling the company to increase so-called sector profit, or pretax operating earnings, at the three units in fiscal 2009, although revenue and orders fell amid the downturn. 'That actually would suggest that the moment our business recovers and grows, we will get a lot of incremental margin dropping to the bottom line,' Kaeser says. Siemens' shares have benefited as the cost-cutting moves helped to bolster profits. The company's stock climbed 71 percent in the 12 months ended April 7 to 75.06 euros, outpacing the 44 percent gain in Germany's DAX index in the same period. Kaeser says he's uncertain about when a sustained recovery will take place, particularly in manufacturing. 'There are signs of hope, but there is no consistent picture of what the industrial world will do going forward,' he says. Siemens executives were similarly cautious even after announcing that profits exceeded analysts' expectations for the first three months of fiscal 2010. The company affirmed its guidance for sector profit from the three main divisions of 6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) to 6.5 billion euros for the full fiscal year, which will end on Sept. 30. Kaeser said in February that Siemens may revise its profit targets when it releases results for the second quarter, at which time the outlook for the company's industrial businesses may be clearer. He says Siemens expected to learn more about customer demand at the Hannover Messe, an international trade fair being held in Hanover, Germany, from April 19-23. 'We do expect that we'll get a lot of insight on what our important customers are going to do, are going to intend in the next 12 to 18 months,' Kaeser says. Siemens will announce its earnings for the March quarter on April 29. Even if demand picks up this year, Kaeser says it's unlikely that revenue will return to pre-recession levels anytime soon. 'Our viewpoint of our global business is that it takes years until we are back up at levels of 2008, where we came from -- probably 2011, if not 2012,' he says. When growth does resume, Kaeser says, the geographical mix will be different, driven by demand from China, India and Brazil rather than Europe and the United States, as in the past. Siemens is addressing this changing reality by reviewing its operations and workforce. In January, Siemens announced about 2,000 job cuts in Germany, where it started its business 163 years ago. 'This is in the industrial area, drive technologies as well as industrial solutions, where we know that it ain't coming back,' Kaeser says. 'And if it comes back, it's going to be in India or China.'

1,"Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan says the government will acquire &#8264;lion ($110 billion) in defaulting property loans from Ireland's struggling banks -- and pay 30 percent less. Lenihan revealed the price tag on Ireland's bail-bailout plans as the government opened debate Wednesday on a complex bill to create Ireland's 'bad bank,' the National Assets Management Agency. Lenihan says the agency will pay five Irish banks &#8264;lion in government-backed bonds. In exchange, the agency will take ownership of &#8264;lion in delinquent debts. He says the assets backing the loans are worth just &#8264;lion today, reflecting a 50 percent fall in property prices since 2007. The government expects prices to recover once Ireland's recession ends. "
1,"Well, that didn't take long. The catastrophic earthquake in Haiti has already elicited a number of controversial statements from some of America's best-known talking heads. Rush Limbaugh, the Rev. Pat Robertson and Keith Olbermann generated outrage, from the left and the right, for comments that variously tied the massive tragedy to President Obama, the Devil and the need for health-care reform, respectively. Mere hours after the island nation was devastated by the quake, Robertson suggested on his '700 Club' program Wednesday night that the disaster was payback for a 'pact with the Devil' that Haitian slaves made to gain their independence from France more than 200 years ago: 'Something happened a long time ago in Haiti and people might not want to talk about it,' the televangelist said. 'And they got together and swore a pact to the Devil. They said, `We will serve you if you'll get us free from the French.' True story. And so the Devil said, `OK, it's a deal.' ... But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another.' The comments _ reminiscent of Robertson's statements blaming gays and secular liberals for Hurricane Katrina and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks _ brought widespread condemnation from other commentators on TV and online. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith played a clip of Robertson's comments and offered this take: 'The people of Haiti have been used and abused by their governments over the years. They have dealt with unthinkable tragedy, day in and day out. And we're in the middle of a crisis that the Western Hemisphere has not seen in my lifetime. And 700 miles east of Miami, hundreds of thousands of desperate human beings need our help, our support, our money and our love. And they don't need that.' Limbaugh generated criticism during his Wednesday afternoon radio broadcast by saying Obama would seek to score political points with African-Americans by getting out in front of the relief effort. 'This will play right into Obama's hands _ humanitarian, compassionate,' Limbaugh said. 'They'll use this to burnish their, shall we say, credibility with the black community, in both the light-skinned and dark-skinned black community in this country. It's made to order for him.' The 'light-skinned' and 'dark-skinned' remarks were apparently alluding to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's, D-Nev., reference before the 2008 campaign that Obama's light skin would make him palatable to more voters. Limbaugh was equally suspicious and cynical about Obama's call for donations. When a caller to his program noted that Obama had directed people to the White House's Web site (Whitehouse.gov), Limbaugh replied, 'Would you trust that the money is going to go Haiti? But would you trust that your name's gonna end up on a mailing list for the Obama people to start asking you for campaign donations for him and other causes?' He added, 'Besides, we've already donated to Haiti. It's called the U.S. income tax.' On Thursday, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs responded to Limbaugh's comments, saying, 'In times of great crisis, there are always people that say really stupid things. I don't know how anybody could sit where he does, having enjoyed the success that he has, and not feel some measure of sorrow for what has happened in Haiti.' Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research Center in Alexandria, Va., noted the speed with which political rhetoric has colored the unfolding humanitarian disaster. 'Every public event becomes a political event, it seems,' he said in an interview. 'There's a political calculation to everything. The timing on (these remarks) is certainly raw.' Widespread political criticism of President George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Graham said, 'didn't really kick in until four to five days' after the storm. While he called Robertson's comments 'wacky' and 'pseudo history,' Graham gave a pass to Limbaugh. 'It reminds me of what (Limbaugh) said about Ted Kennedy's death: `Watch (Democrats) use his death to push health-care reform.' They literally did what Rush Limbaugh predicted. You can say that what he said about Kennedy was impolite, but it ended up being correct.' Graham instead criticized MSNBC host Olbermann for comments on his Wednesday night program that tied the situation in Haiti to the effort to reform health care in the United States. Olbermann also offered this about Limbaugh and Robertson on his program: 'And I would wish you to hell. But knowing how empty your souls must be for you to be able to say such things in a time of such pain, I suspect the vacant, purposeless lives you both live now are hell enough already.' Said Graham, 'I would argue that Limbaugh is cynical but Olbermann has more rage.' "
1,"In light of lawsuits in which denture users claim they've been harmed by the zinc in their denture adhesive, GlaxoSmithKline has pledged to remove the mineral from its Poligrip products, even as the company maintains that they are safe when used as directed. Procter & Gamble, maker of Poligrip's major rival, Fixodent, says no changes are planned for its product, which it says contains much less zinc than Glaxo's does. Zinc is used to help strengthen the bond between dentures and gums. But many people have claimed that they've suffered neurological damage leading to numbness, partial paralysis and, in one case, death, as a result of using denture adhesives. Dietary zinc _ prime sources include meat, poultry, beans, nuts and oysters _ is good for people, to a point. It bolsters the immune system and promotes wound healing, among other benefits. But too much zinc has long been known to cause neurological problems. Researchers reporting in the journal Annals of Neurology in 2008 found a link between the zinc in denture creams and serious neurologic disease in cases of 'chronic excessive use' of those creams. According to the American Dental Association, well-fitted dentures should need just a tad, if any, adhesive to keep them in place. If you find you need more, have your dentures adjusted or replaced.

1,"The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: It is easy, and perhaps even justified, to be pessimistic about the prospects for the newly created Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The panel is supposed to report to President Barack Obama and Congress by December with a plan for getting the federal deficit down to manageable levels; the rules require agreement from 14 of the 18 members. That means that two of the Republican congressional appointees would have to concur in the recommendations of the commission, which is conceivable but not likely. Look at it this way: What are the chances of achieving consensus in a group that includes liberal Democrat Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and conservative Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas? The other Republicans, for the record, are Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Michael Crapo of Idaho and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, along with Reps. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Dave Camp of Michigan. The chances aren't great, but then again, there's no opportunity cost in trying. Fiscal responsibility is unlikely to sweep Congress before the midterm election. And there are arguable benefits to the exercise even if it fails. First, there is a possibility that the commission could focus effectively on a more modest target, such as putting Social Security on a sustainable footing. The elements of a Social Security deal _ changes to reflect increased life expectancy, an increase in the amount of earnings subject to taxation and altering the indexation of benefits _ are obvious. Both sides have incentives to make a deal: the administration and Democrats to show their ability to tackle the deficit, Republicans to get the issue off the table during the Democrats' watch. Second, and more likely, even a splintered commission could come up with competing plans for addressing the fiscal problem. These could in turn be a framework for future discussions or for recommendations by the president, whose advisers insist that he is serious about tackling the fiscal situation. A timely reminder of the need for action came last week from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. 'To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above,' Bernanke said. 'These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put them off _ until the day they cannot be put off any more. But unless we as a nation demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility, in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth.' The only realistic solution is Bernanke's combination platter: The necessary savings can't be achieved on the tax or spending side alone. The fiscal responsibility commission could do the nation a service by acknowledging this difficult truth, or at the very least by offering a clear picture of how unappetizing the extreme recipes of both sides would be.

1,"Vietnam has chosen Japan as a partner to mine rare earth metals and develop nuclear power in the Communist country, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Sunday. Kan made the comments to reporters after meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Tan Dung, in Hanoi and said it was a sign of the 'strategic partnership between the two countries.' Japan earlier this month announced plans to begin mining in Vietnam for rare earth metals used in the manufacture of high-tech products such as laptops, cell phones and hybrid cars, in a bid to reduce its dependence on China, which produces some 97 percent of the world's supply. China has blocked rare earths shipments to Japan following a diplomatic spat between the two countries over disputed islands in the East China Sea, after a collision of a Chinese fishing trawler with two Japanese patrol boats. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently called the export block a 'wake-up call' for the world to find additional sources of rare earths. Vietnam has plans to build eight nuclear power plants by 2030 to meet rising energy demand. Currently, hydropower contributes more than a third of the country's energy. Kan confirmed that Japan would help Vietnam develop nuclear power. Also Sunday, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev met with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Minh Triet and witnessed the formal signing of a deal to build Vietnam's first nuclear power plant. The two countries agreed to the deal last year, and construction is to start in 2014 and be completed in 2020. Russia's state atomic corporation Rosatom said in a statement that it will built two reactors at the plant with a total capacity of 2,400 megawatts. Like Japan, Russia is anxious to gain a footing in Vietnam's fast-expanding nuclear power market. Rosatom chief Sergey Kiriyenko told Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency in Hanoi that Moscow is negotiating with Vietnam to build two more reactors and is 'aware of worthy competitors from other countries.' On Saturday, Vietnam hosted a summit of East Asian leaders, including Kan. Top officials from the U.S. and Russia also attended. ------ Associated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report. "

1,"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says that revelations from confidential U.S. cables released by the WikiLeaks will not harm Moscow's relations with Washington. Medvedev said in a live interview with state television stations Friday that he and other Russian leaders were long aware of the opinions expressed in the cables that are similar to those found in the media. In the WikiLeaks cables, American diplomats and their sources described Russia as 'virtual mafia state.' The leaked U.S. cables also described Medvedev as 'Robin' to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's 'Batman.' "
1,"A top Iraqi official said Wednesday that guards formerly employed by the private security firm Blackwater Worldwide must leave the country within days. The statement by Interior Minister Jawad Bolani _ made in an interview with the Associated Press _ could lead to the expulsion of as many as 250 guards who once worked for Blackwater and who now work for other security firms in Iraq. The Interior Ministry controls the country's police forces and licenses private security companies. Still, some Iraqi officials dismissed Bolani's announcement as posturing, saying he was seeking to win political points ahead of a March 7 parliamentary election. Bolani, a Shiite, leads a mixed, secular slate of candidates. Cracking down on guards associated with Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, and foreign security companies in general, is likely to resonate with voters. Many Iraqis came to see foreign security guards as reckless mercenaries who acted callously toward Iraqis. Blackwater, in particular, became loathed in Iraq after a September 2007 shooting in central Baghdad that led to the deaths of at least 14 Iraqis. The dismissal late last year of an indictment in U.S. District Court against five of the Blackwater guards involved in the shooting unnerved Iraqi officials. Xe Services was expelled from Iraq last year. A senior American official said none of the guards involved in the Nisour Square shooting remains on U.S. security contracts. 'Our embassy in Baghdad will take up the matter with the Iraqi government,' the official said on the condition of anonymity. Referring to the timing of the announcement, he noted: 'It's political season in Iraq.' The sudden departure of 250 guards would be a blow to the embassy at a delicate time. Violence has increased in the run-up to the election, and American officials are on high alert after the kidnapping of a U.S. contractor in Baghdad last month. - - - Sheridan reported from Washington.

1,"Retailers have resuscitated their bottom lines after the dark days of the recession, thanks to heavy cost-cutting, inventory reductions and a stabilizing consumer. Three major chains reported solid quarterly earnings Tuesday, kicking off a week of retail-sector reports. Target's profit soared 53 percent on better-than- expected sales and 'disciplined' expense controls. Macy's swung to a $466 million profit after losing $4.8 billion a year ago, despite an overall decline in sales. Sears profit more than doubled, to $430 million. 'We had thought early on ... that margins would recover significantly and numbers would accelerate pretty dramatically,' said Todd Slater, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets who covers Target. 'The question from here on is when do revenues really begin to fill the gap.' Retailer results this week will be particularly significant because they cover the all-important holiday selling season. Many chains were expecting a weak holiday and had prepared by closing poorly performing locations reducing the amount of merchandise on the shelves and keeping their staff levels lean. That helped ensure their profits remained intact even if sales remained slow. The pruning is ongoing: West Elm is closing its downtown Washington, D.C. store next month. But even as retailers celebrated strong profits, new data released Tuesday show renewed consumer fears about the economy that could impede future sales growth. The Conference Board's monthly index of consumer confidence fell by 10.5 points in February after rising the previous month. Consumers reported they were particularly concerned about their present circumstances, and the drop coincided with the Dow Jones industrial average's plunge below the psychological benchmark of 10,000 early this month. C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, which studies consumers, said the volatility of the markets can wreak havoc on shoppers' and retailers' mind-sets. 'Retailers are obviously much more focused on Wall Street than Main Street,' he said, citing many stores' reductions in staffing and other services to cut expenses. At Macy's, revenue dropped 1.1 percent to $7.8 billion during the fourth quarter. But the chain has been consolidating its organizational structure and focused on reining in expenses. It slashed inventory by 3 percent compared with a year ago. Macy's executives said the changes have made the retailer more efficient and better able to respond to the needs of customers in each market. It also got an unexpected boost from a 27 percent spike in online sales and a rebound at its higher-end Bloomingdale's division. But executives said even as they position the company for growth, they weren't counting on consumers to come roaring back to life anytime soon. 'Business feels better, there is no question about it,' chief executive Terry J. Lundgren told analysts in a conference call Tuesday. 'But still we have high unemployment, and I see tightening credit on consumers. ... A company of our size must recognize that macroeconomics do matter.' At Target, customer traffic increased 2 percent during the fourth quarter, helping the cheap chic chain deliver double-digit earnings growth. The company also said sales of home and apparel merchandise improved, indicating that consumers may be more willing to spend on some discretionary items. 'This is truly remarkable profit performance in light of the economic challenges and top line pressure we faced over the last two years,' chief financial officer Douglas Scovanner said in a conference call. Target had stumbled during the height of the recession as weary consumers traded down to lower-priced competitors such as Wal-Mart and cut out unnecessary purchases. But last week, Wal-Mart reported that traffic at its U.S. stores remained flat and its heavy emphasis on groceries dragged down sales as food prices fell. Target said on Tuesday it intends to open 13 stores this year and is remodeling many of its existing locations to include more grocery products. It also outlined plans of creating smaller, urban stores and hoped to expand internationally within three to five years. 'We believe that the company's strong franchise and solid customer loyalty remain intact,' Robert Drbul, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a research note on Tuesday. Sears chief executive Edward Lampert wrote in an open letter to shareholders Tuesday that he has been willing to invest in areas that could bring long-term growth, including its service business, e-commerce and new store concepts. But the company also shuttered 27 stores in the fourth quarter, and Lampert wrote that many retailers had overextended themselves during better economic times. Sears stock fell 1.9 percent, or $1.86, to $93.80. Macy's finished the day up 1.1 percent, or 20 cents, at $18.67, while Target dropped 1.2 percent, or 58 cents, to close at $50.06. "
1,"A controversial law to establish a compensation system for nuclear accidents _ a key step to allowing American companies to set up reactors in India _ was introduced in parliament Friday, as opposition lawmakers accused the government of favoring U.S. and business interests over the rights of the people. Opponents chanted 'shame, shame' as minister of science and technology Prithviraj Chavan moved the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill in the lower house of parliament. They then left the chamber in protest. 'We tried our best to bring changes to this bill, but because of the stubborn attitude of this government, we have decided to walk out,' said Sushma Swaraj, a member of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Other members called the bill 'illegal' and 'unconstitutional' and accused the government of acting under American pressure. The opposition lawmakers said the bill takes away victims' right to bring compensation claims to court in the event of a nuclear mishap. After Friday's walkout, a government official said that the government may agree to defer voting and refer the bill to a review committee of lawmakers. The bill, which has been the subject of heated debate for months in India, seeks to place the burden of damages solely on the nuclear plant operator and not on suppliers of equipment. It is controversial for Indians because it renews troubling memories of compensation battles in the aftermath of a poisonous gas leak from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal in 1984. The liability legislation is one of the last steps needed to fully activate a landmark civilian nuclear agreement between India and the United States that will allow American companies to set up reactors in India. The 2008 nuclear accord allows India to access global nuclear technology and fuel supplies after more than three decades of international boycott, following the Indian atomic test in 1974. With the help of American, French and Russian nuclear companies, India hopes to fortify its power-starved emerging economy by generating 63,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 2030 _ up from 1,700 megawatts currently. Tens of thousands of jobs would be created in both India and the United States, proponents say, generating business worth more than $100 billion. But India, a nuclear power for more than 30 years, has no legislation to cover claims in the event of a nuclear accident. A government official said that 416 of the 436 nuclear installations in the world are covered by liability laws. The exceptions are the 18 installations in India and two in its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Until India passes a liability law, American companies such as GE and Westinghouse cannot begin operations there, even though two sites have been set aside for nuclear plants supported by American technology. 'There is a strong and persuasive case to have a law that underwrites the compensation liability if a nuclear accident occurs,' said Manish Tiwari, a member of parliament for the ruling Congress party. 'Companies will need insurance for setting up nuclear reactors, so the law makes clear the compensation liability. Without insurance, the companies cannot pay the victims of a disaster.' Critics of the bill say that it places legal liability for mishaps on the state- run operator of the plant, the Nuclear Power Corp. of India, and not on the private suppliers and contractors _ many of which would be foreign companies. The bill places a compensation cap of $100 million on the state-run operator and allows compensation directly from the Indian government of up to $450 million. 'What kind of a joke is this? If we are the victims of an accident, our tax money will be used to pay us compensation. Why should we shield the foreign suppliers of equipment?' said Murli Manohar Joshi, a member of parliament with the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a recent meeting. 'This is not America, this is not Russia. In India, the density of population is very high. The impact of a nuclear accident would be enormous.' Chavan defended the bill last month by saying that the cap is an assured amount that relieves the victims of the arduous task of proving negligence. 'There will be thousands of suppliers to a nuclear plant. If the victims have to go after each and every supplier, they will never get compensation,' Chavan said. 'This bill is a single-window system of compensation.' Some critics say the cap is too low. Others say there should be no cap on compensation at all. 'Shielding the nuclear industry from the economic consequences of nuclear accident reduces the incentive to pursue highest levels of safety in the plant,' said Samit Aich, executive director of Greenpeace India.

1,"Most stocks fell Friday, pulling the Standard & Poor's 500 Index down from a 17-month high, as a drop in consumer confidence overshadowed an unexpected increase in retail sales Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. fell more than 1.5 percent and S&P 500 financial shares ended their longest streak of gains since at least 1989. Pfizer Inc. slid 1.2 percent after its drug failed to halt the progression of advanced breast tumors. Caterpillar Inc. helped lead the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher on signs of growing demand for construction machinery in China. About 10 stocks declined for every nine that rose on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,149.99 at 4:08 p.m. in New York, erasing an early gain of 0.3 percent after a decrease in the Reuters/ University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index signaled continuing concern over the job market. The Dow rose 12.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,624.69. 'It looks like confidence is beginning to wane,' said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston. 'Confidence is going to suffer until we get real improvement on the jobs front. In addition, the stock market is a little bit extended right now. A minor pullback wouldn't be surprising.' Stocks rose for a third day Thursday, sending the S&P 500 Index to the highest level since October 2008, as Citigroup Inc. led a rally in bank shares. The S&P 500 gained 1 percent this week and the Dow climbed 0.6 percent. The S&P 500 closed at a 15-month high of 1,150.23 on Jan. 19, and then plunged 8.1 percent through Feb. 8 on concern that European nations including Greece will fail to pay back debt and speculation that the Fed will need to rein in emergency stimulus measures as the economy improves. The index has since erased that loss to extend its rebound since March 9, 2009, to 70 percent. 'The glass may be half full, but people are not quite certain they can hold on to the glass,' said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, which manages $18 billion. 'The market is jittery. Every little piece of news will make people nervous or happy. On top of that, the excess debt situation throughout the developed markets is a big headwind. That will keep economic growth at a subpar level.' Financial shares in the S&P 500 retreated for the first time in 11 sessions, losing 0.4 percent as a group. Citigroup Inc. fell for the first time in nine days after Oppenheimer & Co. said the stock is fairly valued and under a 'cloud' as long as the federal government remains a major shareholder. Citigroup dropped 5 percent to $3.97 after Thursday rising to the highest since November. Charles Schwab Corp. sank 3.5 percent to $18.43 after saying it expects first- quarter earnings to be as much as 4 cents a share lower than its fourth-quarter results. Fourth-quarter net income was 14 cents. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a first-quarter profit of 15 cents a share. Bank of America had the biggest decline in the Dow, dropping 1.6 percent to $16.85. Health-care stocks dropped 0.4 percent collectively. Pfizer retreated 1.2 percent to $17.08. The world's largest drugmaker said the cancer drug Sutent failed to halt the progression of advanced breast tumors in two studies. The company also stopped a trial of an experimental medicine to treat lung malignancy. United Technologies Corp. slipped 0.7 percent to $71.53. The maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines said it expects 2010 earnings per share of $4.40 to $4.65. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $4.64 a share. Sears Holdings Corp. and Macy's Inc, the largest U.S. department-store companies, gained at least 1.7 percent. Makers of construction machinery rallied after Komatsu Ltd. of Japan, the world's second-largest seller of large dump trucks and excavators, said it expects sales in China to increase 40 percent to 50 percent in the year starting April 1. Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of bulldozers, gained 2.5 percent to $60.36, the second-biggest gain in the Dow. Paccar Inc., a maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks, rose 3.9 percent to $41.35, the highest since September 2008. Monsanto Co. rose 1 percent to $72.35. The company, facing antitrust probes into its genetically modified seeds, may benefit from previous court rulings in which intellectual property rights trumped competition concerns, according to antitrust lawyers.

1,"Bundesbank board member Thilo Sarrazin resigned after his comments on Jews and Muslims sparked political outrage and condemnation from Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'The board of the Bundesbank and board member Thilo Sarrazin are aware of their responsibility regarding the institution of the German Bundesbank,' the central bank said in an e-mailed statement Thursday in Frankfurt. 'The parties involved will end their working relationship at the end of this month' by mutual agreement. The announcement ends a controversy that dragged the independent Bundesbank into the political sphere, forcing it for the first time to ask the country's president to fire a member of its board. Sarrazin, 65, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published Aug. 29 that 'Jews share a particular gene' and Muslims have more difficulty assimilating into society than other immigrants. German President Christian Wulff accepted Sarrazin's resignation and 'welcomed' his decision, a spokesman said. A spokeswoman for Merkel's government declined to comment. In his book 'Germany Abolishes Itself,' which was released last week and Wednesday reached the top of Der Spiegel magazine's nonfiction bestseller list, Sarrazin argues that poorly educated immigrants are making Germany 'dumber.' Merkel described the remarks as 'completely unacceptable.' Under German law, only the head of state can fire one of the Bundesbank's six board members. Thursday's resignation will end concerns that the controversy could have dragged on. Law professors had argued that any disciplinary action by Wulff might run astray of European and national rules that protects the independence of central banks. 'I know my employment contract, that's for sure,' Sarrazin said Aug. 30. While Sarrazin's views were decried by politicians, they have found favor in some sections of the public. Most Germans saw no need to dismiss Sarrazin from the Bundesbank board, a poll showed Sept. 1. Fifty-one percent of 1,000 respondents said firing him wasn't necessary, while 32 percent wanted him ousted, according to the Emnid poll taken Aug. 31 for the N24 television channel. While 35 percent said they disagreed with Sarrazin's arguments, 30 percent said they agreed. In an extract of his book published in Der Spiegel last month, Sarrazin wrote, 'I don't want the country of my grandchildren and forefathers to be in broad swathes Muslim, where Turkish and Arabic is widely spoken, where women wear headscarves and where the daily rhythm of life is set by the call of the muezzins.' _ With assistance from Cornelius Rahn in Frankfurt and Tony Czuczka in Berlin.

1,"Saudi Arabia has shrugged off newly leaked U.S. diplomatic memos that say King Abdullah urged a U.S. attack against Iran. Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman says the memos 'do not concern us.' The spokesman, Osama al-Naqli, says the kingdom has no insight into the authenticity of the documents and 'we cannot comment on them.' His statement was carried by Saudi media on Tuesday. A leaked document described a Saudi official reminding U.S. diplomats of advice given by Abdullah that the Americans attack Iran to 'cut off the head of the snake' and cripple its nuclear program. Although the Sunni kingdom is weary of Shiite Iran's growing influence and nuclear potential, Saudi officials rarely speak publicly about such concerns. "
1,"Iran on Thursday executed two men accused of involvement in an armed anti-government group, as the public prosecutor announced that new death sentences have been issued against opposition activists involved in protests over June's disputed presidential election. The announcements marked an escalation by the courts enforcing the clerical leadership's heavy, monthslong crackdown aimed at crushing the opposition challenge. The prosecutor also said a new group of protesters and others would soon be brought to trial. The two men, who were hanged before dawn Thursday, had been arrested before the election and did not appear to be connected to the postelection protests. But they were put before the same mass trial as opposition leaders and activists arrested amid the crackdown, and state media Thursday depicted the two as part of the protest movement, a sign of how the government has used the unrest as an opportunity to pursue other enemies. The media's depiction of the executions may aim to intimidate the opposition ahead of new street demonstrations expected in February. In a further move likely aimed at cowing protesters, Tehran's prosecutor announced that five people have been sentenced to death for involvement in the most recent major demonstration, on Dec. 27. That day saw the worst violence of the crackdown, with at least eight people killed in clashes between police and protesters and hundreds arrested. The new verdicts raise to nine the number of people sentenced to death for involvement in protests, said the prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi. He also announced that another group of the postelection detainees would go on trial on Saturday. He said the trial will demonstrate the role of 'leftists, Bahais and those who were directed by foreign hands' in the postelection turmoil. He did not say how many new defendants would go on trial. Iranian authorities regularly accuse the U.S., Britain and other foreign enemies of fueling the unrest in a bid to oust the country's clerical leaders. They have also accused followers of the Bahai faith, which is illegal in Iran because it is seen as heretical. The two men who were executed, Mohammad Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, were convicted by a Revolutionary Court of belonging to 'counterrevolutionary and monarchist groups,' plotting to overthrow 'the Islamic establishment' and planning assassinations and bombings, Dowlatabadi told state TV. He said the two confessed during the trial and that an appeals court upheld their death sentences. He made no mention of the postelection protests in connection to the case. White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton on Thursday said the executions represent a new low in Iran's crackdown on peaceful dissent and will further isolate Tehran. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, for his part, condemned what he called the 'TV show trials'that convicted the two. 'The trials and now thesesubsequentexecutions undermineIran's claimed commitment tojustice,human rights and democratic values,' he said. Rahmanipour's lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, told the Associated Press Thursday that the 20-year-old Rahmanipour was arrested in April on the charge of membership in an armed opposition group, the Royal Association of Iran. She said his trial and verdict were 'unfair and illegal,' saying his lawyer was not allowed to participate in the court sessions and he was forced to confess. She said she and Rahmanipour's relatives had not been notified of any appeal's court ruling upholding the death sentences. Ann Harrison, an Iran expert at the London-based rights group Amnesty International, said that Zamani was also arrested before the June election. Iran's English language channel, Press TV, said that among the charges against the two was that they had a role in the 2008 bombing of a mosque in the southern city of Shiraz. Still, state TV portrayed the executions as part of the postelection crackdown. In a report aired on the channel and reported on its Web site, it said Rahmanipour and Zamani were sentenced to death along with the nine others 'in the wake of the rioting and counterrevolutionary and antiestablishment acts of recent months.' Along with the charges laid out by the prosecutor, it said they were convicted on the charge of 'moharebeh,' or defying God. Harrison said the two were arrested before the elections but were dragged into the postelection crackdown 'as part of these mass show trials. Their indictments show the authorities are trying to create a kind of conspiracy, to say that foreign groups and countries are involved to discredit the opposition.' 'The tactics they are resorting to are executions as means of warning the people against participating in further demonstrations,' she told The Associated Press. The opposition says President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the June presidential election through fraud. Hundreds of thousands have poured into the streets in Iran since then on various occasions to support Ahmadinejad's main challenger, opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi. Dozens of protesters were killed in the unrest and hundreds detained since June. Iran has put on trial more then 100 political activists and figures since August. The defendants have included not only those directly involved in protests but also opposition politicians and writers -- a sign that the leadership has used the turmoil as an opportunity to cast a wide net in pursuing its various opponents. More than 80 of those on trial have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from six months to 15 years. Previously, authorities had said five of those on trial had been sentenced to death. The five more announced by Dowlatabadi should raise the total to 10, but he spoke only of nine. There was no explanation for the discrepancy, but it appeared to be a sign of how others -- like Rahmanipour and Zamani -- have been lumped in with the protest movement. ------ AP correspondent Katarina Kratovac in Cairo contributed to this report.

1,"Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic completed the semifinal lineup at the ATP World Tour Finals with straight-set wins on Friday. The top-ranked Nadal beat Tomas Berdych 7-6 (3), 6-1 in the early match to leave Djokovic needing only one set to finish second in Group A and the third-seeded Serb defeated a listless Andy Roddick 6-2, 6-3. Nadal will meet Andy Murray in Saturday's first semifinal as he bids for his first title at the end-of-season tournament. Djokovic plays Roger Federer. Roddick began his match against Djokovic with an outside chance of reaching the semifinals but the eighth-ranked American was never in contention and was broken three times in a 65-minute loss. Nadal finished Group A with a perfect 3-0 record and appears finally to be getting to grips with the surface at the O2 Arena, having lost all three matches on the same court last year. '(To) finish the season winning all the matches in the group, three victories against top-eight players in probably the most difficult surface for me, is unbelievable now,' Nadal said after beating Berdych for the eighth straight time. 'I'm very happy how I am playing, how I improved during the tournament.' It wasn't all plain sailing for Nadal, who lost his cool momentarily and argued furiously with the officials in the first set. With Nadal trailing 6-5, Berdych's backhand was called out by Brazilian umpire Carlos Bernardes, but Nadal had returned the ball in play. Berdych challenged the call, which confirmed the ball was actually in. The Czech player was then awarded the point. Nadal was convinced the point should have been replayed, and ranted first at Bernardes and then at the tournament supervisor sitting in the front row of the crowd, to no avail. 'There is no argument,' Nadal said. 'I am right, but it's (a) mistake for him. But he is a great umpire and everybody (makes) a mistake.' Berdych said he thought Nadal had stopped playing to indicate the ball was out, and that the umpire was correct to give him the point. 'The referee is probably scared of him and just let him to talk with him too long,' Berdych said. 'He was able to play. But every time when you just raise your hand, that means that you stop the play.' The rare outburst only seemed to fire Nadal up. He reluctantly returned to the baseline to serve at 15-30, and when a fierce forehand drew an error from Berdych, he pumped his fist and yelled his approval. 'Doesn't change nothing, that point,' Nadal said. 'I think I still playing the same level before that point and after that point.' After dominating the tiebreaker, Nadal raced through the second set. Serving for the win at 5-1, he even had the confidence to try a through-the-legs winner, and although that dropped millimeters wide, he still finished with 27 winners to Berdych's 18. Roddick, who had qualified for the eight-man tournament for the eight straight year, leaves London with an 0-3 record after a surprisingly lackluster performance on Friday. The 28-year-old American had won his last four matches against Djokovic and engineered a break point in the opening game, only to put a backhand into the net. Roddick failed to threaten again. A forehand into the net handed Djokovic his first break of the set at 2-1, and Roddick went on to rack up 22 unforced errors as his season ended with a whimper. In doubles, Lukasz Kubot and Olivier Marach beat Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic for their first win in the group, but the Polish-Austrian pair were already eliminated while No. 2-ranked Nestor and Zimonjic were already through to the semifinals. Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi claimed the second semifinal spot from Group B when they beat Wesley Moodie and Dick Norman 6-4, 6-4. "
1,"'The Illusionist' is no mirage. Bucking the tide of glossy, computerized 3-D animations, this little French masterpiece is a throwback to the silent-film era when gestures and expressions spoke volumes. The story of a lonely, aging magician who befriends an admiring teenage girl in 1959, Sylvain Chomet's almost-wordless fairy tale is a poetic meditation on friendship, love and the power of deception. Based on an unproduced script written by the legendary French filmmaker Jacques Tati in the late 1950s, the movie features characters created with hand-drawn 2-D graphics, giving them lifelike imperfections that CGI can't duplicate. (Objects, like cars and trolleys, are rendered in 3-D). Music, natural background sounds and the occasional mumbled word provide the only aural sensations. The movie opens in Paris and includes a brief stop in London, but it's primarily set in Scotland. The magician meets the girl while performing in a pub on a remote island and later takes her to Edinburgh, where he takes a series of menial jobs to feed and clothe her. He makes her think that nice things appear by magic, an illusion he maintains until she falls in love with a handsome stranger. Edinburgh's cobblestone streets and medieval buildings are lovingly imagined by Chomet and his animators, who transport us into a magical world that's hard to leave. "
1,"The pool water is clean, but the toilets in the aquatic venue are blocked. Ticket sales are on the increase but the stadiums still seem mostly empty. There was a 'major communications blunder' at the track that nearly resulted in athletes presented with their medals despite the race being protested. It's day five of competition at the Commonwealth Games. But somehow, based on all the problems, they all seem to have a common theme. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell on Friday said officials at the athletics stadium erred the previous night by not telling the medalists in the women's 100 that the event was under protest. Just as well, as the original winner, Sally Pearson of Australia, was later disqualified. 'There was a problem ... there was a major communication blunder,' Fennell said. On a day when 43 gold medals will be presented, the sports often seemed to be an afterthought, not helped by a results system that has not worked properly since the games opened a week ago. Fennell is part of what is called the 'games-time management committee.' It meets every morning, and on Friday they had several new and continuing issues to handle: a Pakistan official reporting that $550 had been stolen from his room at the athletes' village; the reports of blocked toilets at the swimming venue; poor quality of food to volunteers; and trying to get approval for helicopters to encroach on restricted airspace over the city for television coverage of the marathon and road cycling events. But the biggest question mark of all: if 900,000 tickets have been sold, why do many of the stadiums appear nearly empty? Previous problems in the leadup to the games included construction delays, corruption allegations, concerns about security, outbreaks of Dengue fever and, perhaps the most damaging, complaints about unfinished and filthy accommodations in the athletes' village just days before teams were due to arrive. One mystery out of the way Friday was the quality of the pool water, which was suspected of being responsible for a dozen or more cases of 'Delhi belly' affecting mostly Australian and English swimmers. Fennell said three pools were tested -- including the main pool and warmup pool at the aquatics venue -- 'and the tests results of all those pools is that the water is in keeping with the standards that are required. There are no problems with the water in those pools.' He said the Commonwealth Games Federation doctor had spoken to several team doctors and 'they all agreed that the problems they are having with some of the athletes and officials in the village is not from the water, but could be caused by a number of other things.' Fennell also said that the spiked security barrier which malfunctioned and slammed into a Ugandan team car, injuring three of its officials, would be 'demobilized so there could be no fear of a recurrence.' In early athletics action at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Jamie Adjetey-Nelson ran the second-fastest time in 110-meter hurdles and the second best throw in the discus to stay in the lead of the decathlon after seven events. The Canadian finished the hurdles in 14.76 seconds and threw the discus 45.21 meters to increase his total to 5,888 points. The first of eight track gold medals on Friday's program went to Diane Roy of Canada, who won the parasport 1,500 in 3 minutes, 53.95 seconds. Chineme Bibian Obeta of Nigeria was second in 4:09.29 and Anita Fordjour of Ghana took bronze in 4:18.83. Australia continued its domination at track cycling, winning the men's team sprint for its 11th gold. World champion Alison Shanks won the women's individual pursuit, holding off Wendy Houvenaghel of Northern Ireland an, with Canada's Tara Whitten claiming bronze. Sania Mirza lived up to local expectations by reaching the women's final of the first tennis tournament ever held at the Commonwealth Games. Later, 11 gold medals were scheduled to be awarded in the pool, five each in gymnastics and shooting, and the first in badminton. Many of those venues were completed well after they were supposed to, which prevented many so-called 'test events' from being held. Staging test events would have allowed officials to iron out many of the major problems they are being forced to deal with during these games. 'I don't want to argue that if the stadiums had been delivered to the organizing committee earlier, it would have been better,' Fennell said. 'There is no question about that.' "
1,"Taliban fighters used to swagger with impunity through this farming village, threatening to assassinate government collaborators. They seeded the main thoroughfare, a dirt road with moonlike craters, with land mines. They paid local men to attack U.S. and Afghan troops. Then, beginning in late February, a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces soldiers organized nearly two dozen villagers into an armed Afghan-style neighborhood watch group. These days, the bazaar is thriving. The schoolhouse has reopened. People in the area have become confident enough to report Taliban activity to the village defense force and the police. As a consequence, insurgent attacks have nearly ceased and U.S. soldiers have not hit a single roadside bomb in the area in two months, according to the detachment. 'Everyone feels safer now,' said Nasarullah, one of two gray-bearded tribal elders in charge of the village force. 'Nobody worries about getting killed anymore.' The rapid and profound changes have generated excitement among top U.S. military officials in Afghanistan, fueling hope that such groups could reverse insurgent gains by providing the population a degree of protection that the police, the Afghan army and even international military forces have been unable to deliver. But plans to expand the program have been stymied by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who fears the teams could turn into offensive militias, the sorts of which wreaked havoc on the country in the 1990s and prompted the rise of the Taliban. 'This is playing with fire,' an Afghan government official said. 'These groups may bring us security today, but what happens tomorrow?' Citing Karzai's objections, Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, has blocked the release of money needed to broaden the initiative. He also has instructed State Department personnel in the country not to assist the effort until the Afghan government endorses it. In addition to sharing Karzai's concerns about what would happen to the local defense forces once U.S. oversight ends, Eikenberry and other embassy officials worry that the program would weaken the central government in the eyes of the public and compete with efforts to build up the nation's army and police. 'At the end of the day, how sustainable would a program like this be?' said a State Department official based in Kabul, who like other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal disputes. 'It runs counter to the goal of giving the state a monopoly of force.' The military's interest in local-defense initiatives is driven in large part by President Barack Obama's July 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing combat forces, which has increased pressure on commanders to demonstrate clear progress in their counterinsurgency mission this year. Some military officials have expressed frustration that U.S. diplomats in Kabul have not done more to lobby Karzai and other Afghan officials to change their minds. Interior Minister Hanif Atmar, who had been supportive of the initiative earlier in the year, told participants at a U.S.-Afghan planning session this month that he no longer sanctions it, a reversal that military officials attribute to pressure from Karzai. Atmar instead wants the United States to expand a different local-defense program, which is under the control of his ministry and has been implemented in one province in the east, but U.S. commanders think it will not be as effective as the approach undertaken in Afghanistan. Instead of waiting for Karzai's approval, the Special Forces command has moved forward with pilot projects here and in nine other villages, hoping to show that the forces being created are not militias. The command allowed a Washington Post reporter to visit four of the sites this month. 'There are signs of real promise,' said Brig. Gen. Austin Miller, the top special operations commander in Afghanistan. A senior U.S. military official said Karzai has provided a tacit blessing for a small number of experiments so long as the forces that are created are connected in some way to the Afghan government. The official said the Special Forces aims to build those links. In Washington, a senior administration official involved in Afghanistan policy said the experiments have prompted interest _ and cautious support _ in the White House. 'These sorts of bottom-up solutions need to be part of the equation,' the official said. _ _ _ When a detachment from the 1st Special Forces Group arrived here in mid-January, it seemed like a good place to experiment with the Local Defense Initiative. This part of the fertile Arghandab valley is a key route for insurgents seeking to infiltrate the city of Kandahar, located less than 20 miles away. The population here is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns who belong to the Alokozai tribe. Their leadership has been generally supportive of the Afghan government. But when the soldiers asked the principal tribal leaders in the area to gather to discuss security matters, they were rebuffed. 'The only thing they could agree on was saying to us, `We don't need your help,' ' the detachment commander said. U.S. military officials requested that members of the unit, as well as the name of the village, not be identified because of operational security concerns. The soldiers responded by setting out to drink endless cups of tea with the elders. Instead of driving around in large land-mine-resistant vehicles as conventional U.S. Army units do, the soldiers jumped on camouflage-painted dirt bikes and four-wheel all-terrain vehicles equipped with a front mount for an M240 machine gun and a rear rack upon which a few AT-4 small rockets can be lashed. Their mode of transportation mirrored that of their Special Forces brethren riding horseback with troops of the Northern Alliance in 2001. The goal was to win support for a program that was hatched at a Pentagon City, Va., sports bar last year by Special Forces Lt. Col. David Mann and Seth Jones, a Rand Corp. political scientist who focuses on Afghanistan. They questioned whether the United States and NATO were missing an opportunity by concentrating so many resources on building up the national police, the army and other formal institutions, arguing that the Afghans should try to re-create the informal village-level defense forces that existed in parts of the country when it was a monarchy. Mann and Jones's plan, which senior U.S. commanders endorsed, seeks to allay fears that the effort will breed militias: The forces are not paid or given weapons, and to minimize the risk of warlordism, they are supposed to be under the authority of a group of tribal elders _ not just one person. Within a month, the promise of modest reconstruction projects paid for with the military's discretionary money managed to sway the locals. Nasarullah, who is the Alokozai leader in the village, agreed to sit down with Mohammed Aman, the leader of the minority Kakar tribesmen in the area. A few weeks later, the 22-member force was formed, drawn principally from the Alokozai but with the support of the Kakar. The detachment has trained the members in rifle marksmanship, basic first aid and how to conduct a patrol. They also have received lessons on setting up traffic checkpoints and searching vehicles. Those selected were eager to participate but they initially insisted on being paid for their work _ a line the Special Forces did not want to cross. After extensive negotiations, they compromised: Members of the defense force would receive $10 a day, but they would have to spend part of their time working on reconstruction projects. 'They're pulling security and laying bricks,' the commander said. _ _ _ The defense force appears more ragtag than fearsome militia. Although the members wear matching army-green shalwar kameez and camouflage vests, they have all manner of footwear and headdress. Their AK-47s are battered, and they show more interest in lolling about their compound than imposing authority on the village. But that does not seem to trouble the soldiers here. The measure of their effectiveness, say members of the detachment, has more to do with perceptions of security among the villagers than the amount of time the force struts around. 'They're a tripwire,' Mann said. 'The fact that they're guaranteeing safety is the essence of the program.' To the soldiers here, the clearest measure of the change that has occurred may not be in statistics or comments from residents, but in a one-page handwritten letter, placed in an air-mail envelope and dropped under the gate of the local defense force compound last week. It was addressed to Toorjan, the commander of one of the two police checkpoints on the main dirt road _ the only Afghan government presence in the area. In January, he hit a roadside bomb while driving through the bazaar. He was not seriously injured, but his truck was destroyed. The letter, from a person who said he was a local supporter of the Taliban, was an olive branch of sorts. The writer blamed the bombing, which he said he witnessed, on fighters from Pakistan, and he suggested he was open to switching sides. 'The local Taliban are our neighbors,' Toorjan said. 'Now that the security is better, they have no other choice but to support us.' _ _ _ Even if the Special Forces get the authority and funding to expand the initiative, replicating what has unfolded here will not be easy. It has taken three months of intense effort by one detachment to turn around _ for the moment _ just one village. Although there are several dozen detachments in Afghanistan, not all of them could be reassigned to this task. And even if a few dozen villages were flipped, it may not have the hoped-for strategic impact. Among members of the village defense force here, however, questions of growth are less important than what happens once the flow of U.S. cash ends. Will the group demobilize? Or will it, like so many other armed outfits in Afghanistan's history, morph into something larger and more troublesome? Nasarullah, the local elder, insists that he does not have the money, or the desire, to sustain the effort himself. Even the members do not regard their current roles as a permanent occupation. Some said they would like to join the police. Others said they will go back to their farms. 'I am only doing this for my village,' said Zahir Jan, who owns a small shop in Kandahar that he has entrusted to his brother while he serves in the defense force. 'I am looking forward to the day I can put my gun down. But that day has not arrived.' "
1,"You be the judge: Which was a worse example of Congress at work this week? Was it Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., launching a one-man crusade against extending unemployment and health-insurance benefits while whining about missing a college basketball game? During the five days of infamy, he shouted at reporters from inside a senators-only elevator and flipped his middle finger to onlookers. Or was it Rep. Charles Rangel, Democrat from New York City and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee? The House ethics committee slapped his wrist for accepting a corporate-sponsored trip, which was enough to prompt Jon Stewart, among others, to resurrect a photo of him flopped on a lounge chair on a sandy beach, surely one of the most unflattering pictures of a lawmaker captured in recent times. It's a tough call. Bunning's stunt added pain to the lives of the jobless, furloughed workers building roads and threatened the game his colleagues are playing. The Republican caucus is pretty pleased with its more elegant mode of resistance and doesn't want the public to see obstructionism for what it really is, played out on C-Span. Yet Rangel is a walking, vacationing example of the entitled behavior that sickens voters. In the wake of the 2007 Jack Abramoff scandal, Congress tried to show it could police itself by adopting rules such as banning corporations that employ lobbyists from paying for any trip lasting more than one day. In the Rangel case, the letter soliciting corporations to kick in for expenses for the multiday trip explicitly promised 'prime access to key elected officials' for their money by way of a private reception, good seating at meals, 'photo opportunities, etc.' Even without the 'et cetera,' Rangel ran afoul of the rule by going. So, of course, he blamed his staff, claiming he didn't know who paid for the trip. What Rangel must have known was that he didn't pay. Did he wonder about the identity of those sharks circling him in bright resort wear, sipping pina coladas, as they enjoyed the 'prime access' they'd paid for? The trip smelled bad before it began. Organizers had sent Rangel a letter during the planning saying they were worried that HSBC and AT&T might not pony up because they were worried word of the trip might get out and they'd get slammed in the press for funding it. Flying off to a warm climate during winter isn't Rangel's only problem -- it's just the one the ethics committee, moving at the speed of sludge, has found time to admonish him for. There might be an explanation for the panel's slowness in getting to Rangel's other questionable trips, a $1 million contribution from a wealthy businessman who later got a tax break, and not reporting rental income from a vacation villa he owns in the Dominican Republic. Three of the five Democrats on the bipartisan committee got donations from Rangel. One of them went along with him on the island junket in question. It took only two work days for Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, speaking for most of the Republican caucus, to isolate Bunning and force him to stop his obstructionist tactic. It's taken the Democrats far longer to remove Rangel from his privileged position. That's partly because Rangel is beloved and Bunning is not. In fact, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully pressured Bunning not to run for a third term. Bunning was so mad the GOP had hurt his fundraising, he threatened to sue it. In a body of crotchety old men, Bunning is the crotchetiest. He said his Italian-American opponent in his last race looked like one of Saddam Hussein's sons. After beating the so-called Uday, he didn't show up in the Senate for the first month, off on the Appalachian Trail for all anyone ever knew. In a speech last year, Bunning said conservatives soon would occupy a majority of Supreme Court seats because Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would die within nine months from 'bad cancer, the kind that you don't get better from.' While Bunning gets little love, Democrats closed ranks around Rangel last fall, defeating a GOP resolution to strip him of his powerful committee chairmanship. Republicans argued that the country's chief tax writer shouldn't get away with ignoring rules he'd written. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who vowed to have the most ethical Congress in history, made the false distinction that Rangel's conduct was only a 'violation of the rules of the House, not s omething that jeopardized our country in any way.' But Wednesday, as Republicans called for a vote on a similar resolution, Democrats, in fear for their seats, were set to vote against Rangel. In a brief announcement, Rangel agreed to give up his gavel 'temporarily.' Another excuse Democrats gave for not acting sooner was that they didn't want Rep. Pete Stark of California, tax-challenged himself, to take over Ways and Means. He got 'extremely belligerent,' according to ethics investigators, when questioned about his attempt to get a homestead tax exemption in Maryland when his official residence is in California. If Pelosi hopes to keep a Democratic majority, she better get busy cleaning the swamp she promised to drain. On Tuesday night, Washington got another smackdown. Texas Governor Rick Perry walloped Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison by 21 points in the state's Republican primary for governor. Hutchison, who had the Bush family and Dick Cheney supporting her, once had a commanding lead in polls. There was only one reason she lost: voters might dislike the capitol in Austin, but they hate the one in Washington. Margaret Carlson, author of 'Anyone Can Grow Up: How George Bush and I Made It to the White House' and former White House correspondent for Time magazine, is a Bloomberg News columnist. "
1,"Four New York Police Department officers are facing internal charges based on the highly publicized accusations by a fellow officer that they manipulated crime statistics, an NYPD official said Friday. The officers include the former commanding officer of the 81st Precinct in Brooklyn, Deputy Inspector Steven Mauriello. The department launched the probe after Officer Adrian Schoolcraft came forward with accusations that officers were under pressure to falsify records to improve the 81st Precinct's crime rates. The 35-year-old made hundreds of hours of tapes while on duty -- including roll calls, locker room chatter and his bosses yelling at him. Mauriello, a sergeant and two patrol officers were served with the charges this week. A second sergeant was expected to be served next week, said the official, who only named Mauriello. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about an internal personnel matter and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Mauriello was charged with purposely tampering with grand larceny and car theft reports, and with misleading internal investigators. The sergeant was accused of failing to verify that two officers had filed a robbery complaint; the same two officers were charged with not following the order to file the complaint. The officers were not removed from duty and were expected to keep their jobs, the official said. But they could face lesser penalties such as loss of pay or vacation days. NYPD spokeswoman Kim Royster confirmed Friday that administrative charges had been drawn up and served but declined to comment further. The union that represents Mauriello did not immediately respond to a phone message. Schoolcraft made secret tape recordings of officers talking about the alleged misconduct, then distributed the tapes to the media and filed a lawsuit after he claimed his superiors forcibly removed him from the force. Schoolcraft was taken to a hospital psychiatric ward last October by fellow officers and believes he was taken to the ward as punishment for spotlighting the misconduct. The episode was caught on tape and his superiors can be heard giving foul-mouthed orders to haul him off in handcuffs. He spent six days there before he was released into the care of his father. He said he left his shift early that day but with permission. Precinct officers said he was absent without leave and they were concerned for his well-being because he had been seeing a psychiatrist and appeared very anxious. He claims he was bounced from unit to unit when he tried to blow the whistle, and stripped of his gun and badge by a police department doctor whom he spoke to about his job-related anxiety. Police officials view his case as an isolated incident, not a department-wide corruption scandal. Schoolcraft has filed a $50 million suit against the police department and several officers saying he was unlawfully imprisoned. He has not returned to work and is living in self-exile in upstate New York as he pursues his case full-time. Schoolcraft's attorney Jon Norinsberg called the charges a good first step. 'But this is only a very small part of the problem that's out there,' he said. 'As far as we're concerned, this is a citywide problem and until the larger problem is addressed, and there is an investigation into all the precincts in New York, this is a very small step.' "
1,"Deflation is clawing its way back in Japan, and it's not good news for an economy trying to recover from its worst recession since World War II. Japan's key consumer price index tumbled at a record pace in May, the government said Friday. The core nationwide CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 1.1 percent from the previous year in the third straight month of decline. The result marked the biggest fall since the government began releasing comparable data in 1971. Japan appears to be 'heading for another lengthy period of deflation,' said Richard Jerram, chief economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo. Lower prices may seem like a good thing, but deflation hampers growth and can cause consumers to postpone purchases, leading to production and wage cuts. The drop in underlying prices is 'set to be persistent' and can lead to various problems for companies and individuals because interest rates will 'be too high for prevailing economic conditions,' Jerram said in a note to clients. Japan underwent a destabilizing bout of deflation during the 1990s, and again earlier this decade, when the world's second-largest economy struggled to escape from a real estate and banking crisis. After the results, Japan's finance minister Kaoru Yosano expressed concerns about a significant slowdown in demand. 'We continue to monitor price movements, and need to carefully implement economic management to avoid...a deflationary spiral,' Yosano said at a news conference, according to Kyodo news agency. With crude oil prices down dramatically from record highs a year earlier, energy and transportation prices fell sharply in May. Analysts point to the 0.5 percent decline in so-called 'core-core CPI,' which excludes food and energy, as a troubling sign of weakness in underlying prices. The core CPI for Tokyo dropped 1.3 percent in June, suggesting that prices nationwide are headed further south. Prices in the nation's capital are considered a leading barometer of price trends across Japan. 'This is consistent with media reports that large supermarkets are marking such goods down as households turn increasingly defensive amid severe employment and income conditions,' said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. Japan's central bank predicts that prices will keep falling for at least two years. In its latest economic outlook report in May, it forecast core CPI to drop 1.5 percent this fiscal year ending March 2010 and another 1 percent the following year. Key indicators next week will offer a more complete picture of the health of Japan's economy. The government will report May industrial production data on Monday, and unemployment and household spending figures on Tuesday. The Bank of Japan will then release its closely watched 'tankan' survey of corporate sentiment on Wednesday. "
1,"The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: Much of the news from Afghanistan this year has been discouraging, both on and off the battlefield. So it has been a pleasant surprise to see multiple Western news reports use words such as 'rout' to describe recent coalition operations against the Taliban outside the southern city of Kandahar. 'The American military has forced insurgents to retreat from key parts of this strategically vital region,' The Post's Joshua Partlow and Karin Brulliard reported Tuesday. That hardly means that the war has been won. But combined with other developments over the past several months, it's a positive step. The arrival of the last U.S. reinforcements authorized by President Obama permitted the deployment of a force of 12,000 NATO troops to Kandahar and its surrounding districts, which are the Taliban's heartland. With the collaboration of large and relatively effective Afghan forces, which often took the lead, the Taliban was pushed out with surprising speed. Many insurgent commanders are reported to have retreated across the border to Pakistan. The offensive has been accompanied by other aggressive operations around the country. U.S. commander Gen. David H. Petraeus has stepped up Special Forces operations against Taliban field commanders, 293 of whom have been reported as captured or killed in the past three months. Air operations have grown 50 percent; drone attacks against Taliban bases in Pakistan have also increased significantly. No one believes the war can be won by such measures alone. Outside the purely military sphere, some chronic problems persist: U.S. relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai are still fraught, and the Pakistani military still resists taking action against Taliban havens. U.S. commanders say that unless they can tackle corruption and predatory behavior by local police and officials _ something they are only beginning to do _ it will be impossible to persuade the Afghan population to support the government. There nevertheless appears to be evidence to suggest that the Afghan surge ordered by Mr. Obama is beginning to succeed in its first aim, which is to break the Taliban's military momentum. The challenge in the coming months will be to hold the newly captured territory in Kandahar and neighboring Helmand province, secure the highway connecting the two areas, and launch development and anti- corruption projects to win over a wary population. Those are big challenges, but NATO and Afghan forces now have some success to build on. "
1,"For a few hours Sunday night, Audie Crochet's living room became a church. The plush green carpet supported a white pulpit. A suede sofa set and fold-out chairs served as pews. And a 52-inch television thumped out religious-themed music with the power of a full choir. 'Let's pray to God to stick his finger in that plug,' Crochet, 53, said, his body swaying back and forth. 'Yes,' Jason Ross, 37, echoed. 'Plug it.' A day after it was announced that BP's 'top kill' effort had failed, making this gulf-dependent region feel even more helpless, many residents did the only thing they knew to do: pray. They prayed at the Catholic church on Grand Isle. 'Know you are not alone facing the horrible oil spill disaster,' reads a line from the church bulletin. The Rev. Mike Tran's sermon Sunday addressed the oil spill, and the Mass intentions for Monday and Tuesday were to be dedicated to it as well. The floor of the entrance to the church bears four images: a boat, an oil rig, a fish and a bird. They prayed at the Baptist church up the road. 'It's a slow disaster,' said Nathan Stanford, the youth minister. 'We've been praying, but we don't know what to pray for specifically.' They don't know what the final toll will be or whom it will most affect, he said. They, like other congregations, are preparing to give out financial help to residents as needs arise. And they prayed in homes like the one Crochet and his wife bought in a working- class neighborhood in Cut Off. The couple moved there from Grand Isle with their son, John, just before Hurricane Katrina hit. On a wall above the fireplace are three stones, each with a single word: Faith. Hope. Love. Nine people gathered in the living room Sunday night to sing together and hear Crochet, a security guard and real estate agent, give a sermon. The theme that night: Good can come of a crisis. 'It seems like we've been in crisis after crisis after crisis,' said Crochet, who wore a New Orleans Saints championship T-shirt. 'Seems like no sooner we get done with one, another comes up.' The good: Crisis forces innovation and creativity, he said. It tests one's faith, one's strength. It pushes people to surpass their previous limits. It creates leaders. 'I tell you, whoever comes up with the fix to plug this thing, they're going to be patted on the back for years,' Crochet said. 'BP won't have enough money to give them.' 'Let me tell you,' he said. 'Everyone in this room has potential. We do.' Among those in the room were a butcher, two Wal-Mart employees, a security guard and two adults with disabilities unable to work. When the music boomed through the room, the butcher, David Felarise, 50, closed his eyes to sing. The elder Wal-Mart employee, Hilda Ross, 66, threw her arms outward. And Crochet's wife, Rebecca, 55, put one hand on the pulpit and tapped a foot to the ground. Audie Crochet's voice was the loudest. He sang: 'I am pressed but not crushed. I am persecuted but not abandoned. I am struck but not destroyed.' 'Did you see that sign: `God help us all'?' Heather Norwood, 18, the other Wal- Mart employee, said after the singing and sermon were done. She was referring to a figure on the side of the road wearing a gas mask and holding a fish in one hand and the sign in the other. 'In order for that to come true, you have to believe it.' "
1,"I learn about the earthquake last Tuesday night when a text message comes from a friend in New Orleans, with the kind of news you never want to hear. Haiti had been devastated. 'Have you heard from your daughter and other family members?' my friend asks. 'I pray they are OK. Let me know.' I stare at the screen for a few minutes until I am sure I understand what I am reading. I cancel a meeting, purchase a few calling cards and head home to my apartment in the Bronx, N.Y. I take two Advil and start calling my daughter in Port-au- Prince. She is 19 now, and didn't grow up with me. I go to Haiti twice a year to spend time with her and have been struggling to move her to the United States. Now, television news is filled with images of Port-au-Prince, the city where I lived for the first 31 years of my life, in ruins. And my daughter is somewhere within the chaos. By 11:30 p.m. I still can't get in touch with anyone. The phone rings and rings and then the line goes dead. I do have some news. I talked to my sister in Florida. Yes, she heard from our other sisters, who live in the capital. My half-brother is also OK. They were all together when the earthquake hit. But no word on my daughter. By 1 a.m. I've been calling every 15 minutes without any answer. In the middle of this dark moment, I hear, clearly, something my mother used to tell us when we were growing up: 'Things may not get better, but they can always get worse.' This actually calms me down. My mother, who worked as a healer and seamstress while raising 10 children, prepared us for catastrophe. She made sure that her boys and girls knew how to cook and how to wash and repair their clothes by hand. We needed to be able to take care of ourselves in case 'things got worse.' Some nights, she would put us in Haitian beds made of dried banana leaves called n t in the front yard of our home and we'd sleep outside. We needed to get used to sleeping like that, she said, just in case one day we had to. My mother knew we had to be prepared for the worst. And at times, it has seemed that the worst has kept chasing me. In the beginning of the last decade, I had to flee a political mess in Port-au- Prince, and I settled in New Orleans. I had met many artists from that city in the 1990s; they were in Port-au-Prince as part of a cultural exchange encouraged by then-Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, himself of Haitian descent. And New Orleans felt a bit like a sister city to Port-au-Prince, with its gingerbread houses and Creole roots. I had fled my home, but it didn't feel as though I had gone too far away. I left that city a day before Hurricane Katrina hit and saw the water swallow my adopted home from a hotel room in Houston. All last week, I felt the same: I was watching devastation from a comfort zone. Safe myself, but gripped with fear for my friends and family. Is this my luck? To miss the very worst by always expecting it, the way my mother taught me? I could not answer until I knew whether my daughter was safe. Around 6 a.m. I finally get through on her mom's cellphone. My daughter is next to her mother, sleeping with her two half-siblings. 'Where are you?' I ask. 'We're outside in our front yard sleeping on n ts,' her mother tells me. Their house survived the quake, but they decided to stay away in case of aftershocks. After I hang up, my mother comes back again in my memory: I see her standing on the veranda, preparing us to sleep outside. Three decades later, my daughter found herself wrapped up inside a n t in her front yard in Port-Au-Prince. It is most certainly pure legend, I know, but now I remember the Haitian folktale about the magical power of those beds. As the story goes, if a child is threatened by a sorceress' evildoing, you can roll her up in a banana-leaf bed and she will be safe. I was very lucky. My daughter was protected. But my city wasn't. I know Port-au- Prince like my pocket _ I know every single wall in that city. Seeing the destruction is devastating beyond belief. But I have seen one city begin to come back to life after catastrophe: In New Orleans, where I still travel to teach and work, people are learning to use what they have to remake their home. The key is to see things differently than you did before. I have learned from gardening that when you want a plant to grow, at some point you'll have to cut the tops of the branches to allow them to expand and become stronger. But in Haiti there is never enough fuel for fire, so the trees are chopped down wholesale, never given a chance to flourish. Haiti can do better _ for the trees that make up its forests, and for the people toiling to remake life from this disaster. We will rebuild. And we will grow stronger. - - - Lorville is a Haitian artist living in New York. Author's e-mail: vidho@vidholorville.com "
1,"As early as Monday, the signs were not looking good. The National Zoo's female giant panda, Mei Xiang, was exhibiting some behaviors of pregnancy, but not all of them. The ultrasound scans of her uterus were inconclusive. And the level of certain hormones in her body were saying that her annual pregnancy cycle was over. Plus, there was no cub. The zoo announced Wednesday that, taking all factors into consideration, their panda was once again not pregnant. The conclusion was reached, the zoo said, after experts studied the array of physical, behavioral and chemical clues. 'Based on current hormone analyses, and not having seen a fetus during the ultrasound exams, Zoo researchers have determined that Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy,' the zoo said in a statement. The zoo had placed the panda on 24-hour pregnancy watch Friday, and officials had high hopes that Mei Xiang might be pregnant. She was artificially inseminated twice in January. 'This is very disappointing news, as you can imagine,' Dr. Janine Brown, head of the zoo's endocrinology lab, said in an e-mail. 'Everyone puts their heart and soul into the reproductive management of these and other species,' she said. 'We had no reason to believe Mei's last artificial insemination would not be successful, but as so often happens, nature had other ideas.' Mei Xiang has had numerous pseudo-pregnancies in the past and in a decade has produced one cub, Tai Shan. The disappointment comes after the departure in February of the zoo's giant panda favorite, Tai Shan, who was born there in 2005. Tai Shan was sent to join a breeding program in China. In addition, the zoo faces the possibility that Mei Xiang and her mate, Tian Tian, may also soon depart. The adult giant pandas are here on a 10-year lease from China that expires in December. "
1,"LOS ANGELES - Three decades after 'Tron' turned cyberspace into a fantasy world, Walt Disney is pitching the 3-D sequel to grownups with high-end merchandise such as a $2,600 Rotenier necklace and $795 spiked sandals from Rousseau. Disney has rewritten its marketing playbook for 'Tron: Legacy,' which opens Dec. 17, to reach fans old enough to remember the 1982 original. Jewelry and shoes in particular, the priciest items, reflect an effort to attract women. 'The demographic we got to speak to for this film was a young adult and the adult consumer who happened to be around' for the original, said Pamela Lifford, a Disney executive vice president who oversaw development of the 'Tron' fashion goods. 'We knew we had to be creative.' With the haute-couture flourish, Disney's marketing machine is reaching beyond the core science-fiction and fantasy fans who form the movie's natural base. More than 6,000 people, mostly younger men, crowded into the Comic-Con trade show at the San Diego Convention Center in July for footage and talks by actor Jeff Bridges and 'Tron: Legacy' producer Sean Bailey. 'Our thinking is to play a lot broader,' said Bailey, Disney's president of production since January. 'We have the digital whiz-bang wizardry that gets the men in. The No. 1 job was to put a priority on story and emotion, boy meets girl.' 'Tron: Legacy' picks up where the original left off, with entrepreneur Kevin Flynn, again played by Bridges, trapped in a virtual world. Flynn's son Sam is pulled into cyberspace to join his father's battle against a ruthless villain. The movie, which co-stars Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund, was produced for about $170 million, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The company probably spent $20 million to $25 million on a video game, 'Tron: Evolution,' released Dec. 7, estimates Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. A 'Tron' animated television series and a graphic novel are also in the works. 'Tron' fits Disney's business model of picking movie properties that can be spun off into its television, video-game and theme-park businesses, said Nelson Gayton, executive director of the Center for Management of Enterprise in Media, Entertainment & Sports at UCLA. 'When you make these kinds of films you have to appeal to wider audiences, and if you don't, you're never going to make your money back,' Gayton said. Disney has been venturing beyond the kids' audiences that turn out for 'Toy Story' and 'Cars' pictures. A 'Tron' franchise would fit well with the Marvel Entertainment acquisition that brought Disney Spider-Man, Iron Man and the Fantastic Four characters, films that appeal to teenagers, Gayton said. 'Tron: Legacy' is expected to generate as much as $66 million in its opening weekend and $255 million during its run in theaters in the United States and Canada, according to Jeff Hartke, an independent box-office analyst. The original film, made for $17 million, returned $33 million in domestic ticket sales, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. The development of 3-D played into Disney's decision to make the sequel, producer Bailey said. Director Joseph Kosinski used an updated version of the camera equipment developed by James Cameron for 'Avatar' and is aiming for a similar immersive feel, he said. Spinoffs and consumer products were also part of the thinking from the start, Bailey said. The film crew shared images and video with Disney's game developers and merchandise executives as the movie was being made. 'We really tried to spread our creative minds across all of these platforms,' he said. Until January, some items are exclusive to the temporary store Disney set up in Culver City, California, where portions of the original movie were shot, Disney's Lifford said. The store offers $500 Adidas running shoes, a Hurley fleece jacket for $59 and sunglasses made by Oakley Inc. selling for $150. David Tapia, a 'Tron' fan since he saw the original at age 9, visited the store this week. 'I have friends from other parts of the country who are calling me to come in to the store and possibly pick up some things for them,' said Tapia, a casting director for the Fox reality show 'Hell's Kitchen.'

1,"A powerful blast at a popular bakery frequented by tourists killed at least eight people and injured 32 in the western Indian city of Pune on Saturday, the first attack to apparently target foreigners since the deadly 2008 siege of Mumbai. The explosion took place a little after 7 p.m. at the German Bakery in Koregaon Park, an upscale neighborhood near the Osho Ashram. The ashram, a spiritual center with many Western followers, was one of the locations canvassed as a potential target by David Coleman Headley, who is now on trial in Chicago for plotting terrorist acts. Headley had reportedly stayed in a hotel near the ashram. Eyewitnesses told reporters on the scene that there was an unidentified bag at the bakery, which is also near a Chabad House, an Orthodox Jewish outreach center similar to the one targeted in the Mumbai siege. 'We could hear the blast. Thank God we are fine,' Rabbi Betzalel Kupchik of Chabad said in a telephone interview, adding that a group at the center felt the explosion just after gathering for prayer to mark the end of the Sabbath. 'We will continue our work here. We can't back down.' Federal Home Secretary G.K. Pillai said that one foreigner was among the dead and that investigators are trying to determine the nationalities of all the victims. Pillai said that the explosion was likely an act of terrorism and said a team from the National Investigation Agency was en route. Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh put the death toll at nine, according to the Press Trust of India. The bombing came a day after Pakistan agreed to resume high-level talks with India, the first such dialogue between the nuclear-armed powers since relations were frozen after the Mumbai massacre. The United States has urged the two nations to restart talks in hopes that improved relations will help stabilize the region, especially in Afghanistan, where India and Pakistan have been competing for influence. In 2008, a wave of bombings struck markets in Indian cities, killing more than 100 people. Police blamed most of those attacks on homegrown Muslim militants, although some Hindu militants were also suspected of carrying out several attacks. India blames a Pakistan-based militant group for the Mumbai attacks. Shahzad Ahmad, a suspect in bombings in New Delhi that year who was arrested last week, had reportedly told Delhi police that a cell of the Islamist group Indian Mujaheddin was operating in Pune, according to an intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'Ahmad said that the group wanted to sabotage India's hosting of the Commonwealth Games. By targeting foreigners, they want to create an environment of fear,' the official said. The bombing was unlikely to affect the talks between India and Pakistan scheduled for Feb. 25, said Vikram Sood, a former head of the Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence agency also known as RAW. 'The talks are likely to go on,' Sood said. 'Terrorism is something India has to live with.' "
1,"WASHINGTON - Business activity unexpectedly accelerated and fewer workers filed claims for jobless benefits, easing concern the world's largest economy is retrenching further. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said Thursday that its business barometer climbed to 60.4 in September, exceeding the highest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The number of applicants for unemployment insurance payments fell more than projected last week, another report showed. Manufacturing figures Friday and next week's September jobs report will need to confirm that a further slowdown in the economy has been averted in order to reassure Federal Reserve policy makers, who last week said they were willing to take more steps to spur growth. As firings abate, employers aren't adding enough workers to reduce an unemployment rate that's hovering near 10 percent. 'There are still significant headwinds that remain,' said Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. 'It's a moderate recovery. We see the Fed as being on a meeting-to-meeting basis at this point.' Readings greater than 50 for the ISM-Chicago index signal expansion. The median forecast of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected the gauge would fall to 55.5. Estimates ranged from 53.6 to 58.3. The group's measures of orders and production rose above their six-month averages, indicating corporate investment in new equipment will remain a source of strength for the economy. 'After a soft patch, manufacturing is in a process of mustering some activity,' said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York. 'It seems to be moving in the right direction again and that will help the economy continue to grow.' McCarthy forecast the Chicago index would rise to 58. Automakers including Ford are among manufacturers seeing sales picking up while holding below pre-recession levels. 'The auto business is pretty steady and coming back up a little bit,' Ford Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally told reporters in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Sept. 17. The economy 'is coming back slower than past recessions.' Economists watch the Chicago index and other regional manufacturing reports for an early reading on the outlook nationally. The Chicago group says its membership includes both manufacturers and service providers, making the gauge of measure of overall growth. Its members have operations across the U.S. and abroad. Thursday's report was at odds with other measures of manufacturing that showed a slowdown. Another report today showed factories in the Milwaukee region stagnated. Regional Fed surveys earlier this month showed New York-region factories expanded in September at the slowest pace this year, while those in the Philadelphia area shrank for a second month. The ISM's monthly national factory index, due Friday, may drop to 54.5 in September, the lowest reading in 10 months, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed. The number of applications for jobless benefits dropped by 16,000 to 453,000 in the week ended Sept. 25, Labor Department figures showed. The total number of people on benefit rolls and those getting extended payments also fell in the prior week, the report showed. Companies in August added 67,000 workers to payrolls while total employment fell by 54,000, the Labor Department said earlier this month. Unemployment rose to 9.6 percent, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast joblessness will hold near that level for the rest of the year. 'Employers are still kind of cautious,' said Russell Price, a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit, who forecasted claims would fall to 455,000. 'We need to regain that broader momentum in the economy, and something like that is just slow to develop.' The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, revised figures from the Commerce Department also showed Thursday. The increase in gross domestic product compares with a 1.6 percent estimate issued last month. GDP grew 3.7 percent in the first three months of the year and 5 percent at the end of 2009.

1,"Tests results indicate Bret Michaels has a lack of sodium in his body that leads to seizures, according to a message posted Tuesday on the website of the glam rock-reality TV star. The condition, called hyponatremia, is a side effect of a brain hemorrhage that has left the Poison frontman in intensive care at an undisclosed hospital. The tests also found the 47-year-old Michaels suffered a type of stroke that causes bleeding in the fluid-filled spaces around the base of the brain. Michaels' New York-based publicist Joann Mignano provided a written statement confirming the Web posting. The message said doctors are hopeful Michaels will gradually improve as the blood surrounding the brain dissolves and is reabsorbed into his system. "
1,"In an effort to protect the military's computer networks, the Obama administration is planning to put the leader of the nation's largest electronic spying agency in charge of a new military organization capable of launching attacks against enemy networks and power grids. If confirmed by Senate, Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, would take charge of the Pentagon's newly formed cyber command and preside over a virtual army of computer technicians and network warfare specialists. But even as the Obama administration presses the importance of cybersecurity and hails its nominee as an aggressive and innovative military intelligence officer, Alexander's confirmation has been delayed for nearly six months. Lawmakers have questioned whether the head of the NSA should lead a military unit and what, exactly, that new unit will be empowered to do. Alexander is set to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday but has already provided written responses to questions from lawmakers. Among other things, he stated that, faced with a cyber attack, the military must be able to respond in kind. It is 'reasonable to assume that returning fire in cyberspace' is lawful, as long as any actions comply with the laws of war, he said in a 32-page document. At issue is how military and intelligence authorities guide the operations of any new cyber command. U.S. policies governing cyber attacks and counterattacks lag behind the military's ability to conduct them. Part of the challenge is that in cyberspace, a line of computer code could be an attempt to spy, disrupt a network or defend it, and that same code might unintentionally knock out critical systems in countries far from the target. The ambiguity _ and the fact that there is no international consensus on what constitutes use of force in cyberspace _ means the risks of provoking international conflict are real, experts say. Any offensive cyber action must be guided by orders from the secretary of defense and approved by the president, a senior defense official said. He 'can't simply get up one morning and say, `I want to go attack something,' ' the official said. In his written responses, Alexander said that clandestine, offensive actions in cyberspace _ such as dismantling a Web site used by jihadists overseas _ are 'traditional military activities' and should not be considered covert operations. In the event of a cyber attack, the military must still be able to carry out conventional operations. 'Even with the clear understanding that we could experience damage to our infrastructure, we must be prepared to `fight through' in the worst case scenario,' he said. The Justice Department and policymakers are still grappling with the legal and policy boundaries inherent in cyberwarfare, and their decisions may well affect the scope of the command's offensive operations. 'The real problem here has been with the Pentagon and the White House, who have to come up with the cyber command strategy,' said Richard Clarke, a cybersecurity adviser to President George W. Bush and the author of a forthcoming book, 'Cyber War.' In his answers, Alexander makes clear that though the cyber command's focus is on military networks, it will be prepared to 'provide military options' to the president if attacks on private, critical computer systems and civilian government systems threaten the nation's security. He made clear that the military command, not the Department of Homeland Security, would take the 'lead role' in responding to a cyber attack on the United States, but under a presidential order. There are often competing demands between intelligence agencies, which want to obtain information, and the military, which wants to save lives and win wars. In military cyberspace, Alexander said, he would be the 'focal point' for deciding whose interest should prevail in a disagreement. Some intelligence officials are concerned that the launching of a cyber command will draw away NSA resources that might otherwise support the collection of national strategic intelligence. But Alexander, 58, has supporters who say he's up to the task. They also say he's able to make complex technical subjects clear to lay people, including lawmakers. A graduate of West Point, Alexander has masters' degrees in electronic warfare, physics and national security. He already heads an offensive cyber organization, the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare, a body that will be merged into a new cyber command. 'He is a `techie,' but also a communicator,' said NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis. 'He is the right man in the right position at the right time.' As NSA director, Alexander has focused on delivering intelligence to the battlefield. In August 2005, he wanted to speed the harvesting of raw signals intelligence. He wanted a soldier in, say, Fallujah, Iraq, to be able to type in a name or phrase on a laptop-like device, as in a Google search, and in seconds pull up relevant information. He gave NSA developers 90 days to build a prototype. He called it Real Time 10, or Real Time to the 10th power, to emphasize speed. 'The (signals intelligence) may reveal an insurgent who's getting ready to detonate an IED or ambush a unit,' said Collin Agee, an intelligence official who saw RT 10 at work in Iraq. 'The whole point was to compress the timeline.' Senior military officials, including the secretary of defense, praised the NSA's contributions. At the same time, said a former intelligence official, Alexander 'drove the system nuts' by his insistence on in-house, rapid development of RT 10. Critics said Alexander rushed the process and failed to take appropriate procedural measures. A report by the NSA's inspector general concluded no rules had been broken. But questions about the episode have nonetheless contributed to the delay in the confirmation process, said current and former intelligence officials. Supporters say Alexander's emphasis on tactical intelligence has not given strategic intelligence short shrift. Toward the end of the Bush administration, the NSA undertook a major revision of collection priorities, a controversial process that meant some intelligence needs of some agencies would be given less urgency. The State Department asked Alexander and Inglis, his deputy, to reconsider some strategic priorities. 'They heard us out' and made adjustments, a former senior department official recalled. -0-< Staff researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report. "
1,"Britain's economy shrank less than previously estimated during the second quarter of the year, according to revised official figures Friday, supporting hopes that it will exit recession and return to growth in the current quarter. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product contracted by 0.7 percent between April and June, revising its earlier forecast of a 0.8 percent decline. Better performances in the manufacturing and production industries helped drive the change. Rounding out the positive economic news, the Land Registry reported that house prices in England and Wales posted their biggest monthly rise in five years in July, a further indication that the housing market is recovering from its crash. Many analysts expect economic growth to resume in the third quarter of the year, after bottoming out in a 2.4 percent contraction in the first three months of the year. A return to growth in the third quarter would be the first quarterly rise since early 2008, marking the official end of the 2008/09 recession. 'With recent survey data showing the economy in a much healthier state, we expect third-quarter GDP data to show a marked improvement and a positive outturn could be on the cards,' said Hetal Mehta, senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club economic consultancy. But most economists still expect recovery to be slow, with both unemployment and taxes both forecast to rise and ongoing tight credit conditions predicted. The second quarter GDP figures represented an annualized fall of 5.5 percent -- still the sharpest decline since records began in 1955 -- while the Land Registry said that house prices are still down 11.7 percent compared to last year. The Bank of England has likewise suggested it may be too soon to celebrate by earlier this month extending its so-called quantitative easing program -- to boost the money supply through asset purchases -- to 175 billion pounds. 'It certainly won't feel like the recession is behind us, especially in the labour market, and the return of that elusive feel good factor, when growth rates are high enough to make inroads into the unemployment total, will take some considerable time to come through,' said Royal London Asset Management economist Ian Kernohan. Capital Economics economist Vicky Redwood said a recovery is 'based on pretty fragile foundations.' 'The slight upward revision to U.K. GDP in the second quarter is pretty insignificant when set against the near-6 percent drop in output seen during this recession,' she said. 'We continue to expect a pretty minimal rise in GDP next year.' "
1,"NATO forces in Afghanistan say two international service members have been reported missing in the west of the country. NATO forces headquarters issued a statement Friday saying the two were reported missing on Wednesday while on a routine resupply mission. It did not identify their nationality or say which province they had been in when they went missing. It said exhaustive search and rescue operations are being carried out to locate them, and their families have been notified. The statement says no further information will be released while the rescue operation continues and the incident is investigated. "
1,"Greece reached agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund on rescue loans to keep Athens from defaulting on its debts, a deal that will impose harsh cuts on the county's 11 million people for years. The first ever bailout of one of the 16 countries using the euro will require tax increases and salary and pension cuts for civil servants to cut the deficit to within EU limits by 2014, the Greek finance minister said Sunday. 'We are called on today to make a basic choice. The choice is between collapse or salvation,' George Papaconstantinou said. The full amount of the three-year IMF/eurozone package will be announced in Brussels after an emergency eurozone finance ministers' meeting, where Papaconstantinou was heading after his Athens news conference. He said the amount would be 'close to' widely reported figures. French and other officials have said it would be (EURO)120 billion ($160 billion). 'The Greek government has today announced a very comprehensive and ambitious economic program which I indeed welcome,' EU monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn said as he arrived ahead of the finance ministers' meeting in Brussels. 'I'm confident that the eurogroup, the euro area member states, will today endorse this program and I'm recommending to the eurogroup today to activate the mechanism.' It remains unclear whether Sunday's meeting in Brussels will be enough to give final approval for Athens to start receiving the money or whether a summit of eurozone heads of government will be required. Greece has (EURO)8.5 billion worth of a 10-year bond maturing on May 19. Papaconstantinou said savings worth (EURO)30 billion through 2012 would be achieved through public service and pension pay cuts, higher taxes and streamlining government. Annual holiday bonuses will be capped at (EURO)1,000 ($1,330) per year for civil servants and scrapped for those with gross monthly salaries over (EURO)3,000 ($3,995), he said. Pensioners' bonuses will also be capped at (EURO)800 and canceled for those paid more than (EURO)2,500 ($3,330). Salary cuts will not extend to the private sector, as had been widely feared. Greeks receive their annual pay in 14 salaries, receiving extra at Christmas, Easter and for their summer vacations. Taxes would also be increased, including further hikes on fuel, alcohol and tobacco. The top bracket of sales tax rises from 21 percent to 23 percent. Papaconstantinou said his country's debt would reach 140 percent of GDP in 2013 and start falling from 2014, while economic output is set to contract by 4 percent in 2010 and by 2.6 percent in 2011 before it starts recovering slowly beginning in 2012. The new austerity measures were seen as essential for the EU and IMF to unblock the rescue package, which Athens asked for last week and which will see other eurozone countries and the IMF extend loans to Greece. Germany, which has the eurozone's largest economy and would be the largest single contributor, had been highly reluctant to release any funds without Athens implementing more harsh spending cuts. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso described the aid as 'decisive' in getting Greece back on track and protect the financial stability of the 16 nations using the euro currency. Papaconstantinou said the government hoped to be able to return to borrowing on the market soon, but that the plan would allow the government breathing space to implement its austerity program and put its finances in order. 'We are confronted with international markets that do not give us the time to make the necessary adjustments,' he said. Greece has seen its borrowing costs skyrocket to more than four times those of Germany on the international market in recent weeks. Earlier, Prime Minister George Papandreou announced his government had reached an agreement in tough negotiations with the IMF and EU on the measures. 'The avoidance of bankruptcy is the national red line,' he said in a televised speech to his Cabinet. 'I want to be clear to all. I have done and will do everything so the country does not go bankrupt.' Papandreou called on Greeks to make 'great sacrifices' to avoid a catastrophe, and said the country's problematic civil service would bear the brunt. There will also be deep cuts in defense spending and hospital procurement, the prime minister said. 'The alternative course would be a catastrophe and greater pain for all,' he said. Greek unions planning a general strike Wednesday against the new cuts. Violent clashes broke out Saturday during anti-government protests at May 1 Labor Day rallies. 'These are the harshest, most unfair measures ever enacted. That is why our reaction will be decisive and dynamic. You can't always make the workers pay for the results of failed policies,' Stathis Anestis, spokesman for Greece's largest umbrella union, GSEE, told The Associated Press. Anestis indicated the union wants the EU to offer more labor protections. 'We are asking all Europeans to think again: What kind of Europe do they want? What kind of society? What kind of employees?' he said. The government will submit special emergency legislation to Parliament that was agreed upon with the EU and the IMF at a negotiating session Saturday. Parliament is expected to approve the measures by Friday. 'Economic reality has forced us to take very harsh decisions,' Papandreou said, adding that 'This is the only way we will finance our (EURO)300 billion debt.' Some economists believe that Greece's adjustment will be painful, but no more so than when the country devalued its then currency, the drachma, twice in the 1980s and once in the 1990s. Platon Tinios, an economics professor at Piraeus University said the previous austerity programs demanded a lot, but that eventually leaders gave up on them for political reasons. Past experience does not make him confident that politicians will stick to their commitments, he said. -------- Associated Press writers Demetris Nellas in Athens and Raf Casert and Elena Becatoros in Brussels contributed to this report.

1,"All-terrain vehicle riders who formed a parade along Minnesota's North Shore are claiming a world record for their turnout. The All-Terrain Vehicle Association of Minnesota tried Saturday to line up more than 2,000 ATVs in Silver Bay into the longest parade documented for Guinness World Records. Group spokesman Les Schermerhorn said they fell short, but their count was 1,632 ATVs. They hope to have the Guinness organization verify the claim in the coming weeks. The current record of 1,138 ATVs was set by the Harlan County Ridge Runners of Evarts, Kentucky, in 2006. Three-wheelers and side-by-side ATVs do not count. The Minnesota group's attempt last year fell 55 four-wheelers short of the Kentucky group's total. "
1,"In a reversal, the Obama administration says it will not pursue offshore drilling in waters off the east coast of the U.S. including the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A senior administration official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that because of the BP oil spill, the Interior Department will not propose any new oil drilling in the East Coast for at least the next seven years. Obama's earlier plan -- announced in March, three weeks before the April BP spill -- would have allowed drilling from the state of Delaware to central Florida, plus the northern waters of Alaska. The new plan allows drilling in Alaska, but officials said they will move cautiously before approving any leases. "

Defender Maicon fired his 55th-minute shot into the net from a tight angle to beat poorly positioned goalkeeper Ri Myong Guk. Elano struck in the 73rd, placing a right-footed shot into the far corner of the net North Korea had frustrated the five-time champions through unselfish team play, forcing Brazil to rely on long-range shots. Michel Bastos was wide with a 51st-minute free kick, and Robinho fired a shot off target two minutes later. North Korea's best chance was an 11th-minute shot by Jong Tae Se after he dribbled through three tackles. Ri also saved from Elano, Robinho and Maicon. "

1,"A triple bombing hit the main Baghdad office of an anti-U.S. Shiite cleric in the deadliest of a series of attacks across Iraq that killed 44 people and wounded more than 200, officials said. The violence came days after Iraqi authorities announced the killings of the top two al-Qaida in Iraq leaders in what was seen as a major blow to the insurgency. Hospital and police officials say 25 people were killed in the attack on Muqtada al-Sadr's office compound as worshippers were leaving a mosque after Friday prayers. An estimated 150 people were wounded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Bombings elsewhere in Iraq -- most of them targeting Shiite worshippers -- killed 19 other people in one of the deadliest days the country has seen in weeks. Targeting Shiite mosques is a hallmark of the Sunni-dominated terrorist group al-Qaida in Iraq. Explosions outside three Shiite mosques in Baghdad, all timed around the end of Friday's prayers, appeared to be the work of insurgents looking to inflame sectarian tensions. Iraqi Sunnis also were targeted: A ring of bombs planted around the homes of policemen in the western town of Khalidiya killed seven in a pre-dawn attack, including an Iraqi soldier and a woman. It was one of the most deadly days in Iraq in weeks, underscoring the state of its anemic security. In the slums of Baghdad's Sadr City, two parked car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded around 1:30 p.m. near the office of al-Sadr. His followers, hard-line religious Shiites, use the building for Friday prayers, the main worship service of the week. Two police officials and medics at the nearby Sadr and Imam Ali hospitals gave the casualty figures. All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. A spokesman for the Baghdad operations command, Maj. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi, put the number of dead in Sadr City at 10, and added that another bombing at a marketplace in the northern Rahmania area of the city killed two people and wounded seven. It is common for the casualty count to vary in the immediate aftermath of attacks. "
1,"This week is as enormous as they come for economic news. On Monday, several reports are scheduled that could offer insight on the health of the economy. Analysts expect new data to show that personal income rose 0.2 percent in September, and that consumer spending rose 0.4 percent. The estimates are already reflected in the 2 percent third-quarter GDP growth reported Friday. The manufacturing sector is expected to have continued expanding, though at a slower rate, in October. The Institute for Supply Management's index is expected to edge down to 54, from 54.4; numbers above 50 indicate expansion. At 2:15 p.m. EDT on wednesday, the Federal Reserve is to announce results of its two-day policymaking meeting. This is easily the most scrutinized, most hyped monetary policy decision of the year, and arguably in many years. The central bank is expected to announce a major new effort, namely plans to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds to drive down longer-term interest rates. The things to watch: How much bond-buying will the Fed do (smart money is in the ballpark of $500 billion); how inclined Fed leaders seem to be toward expanding the purchases further in the future (try to read between the lines of their policy statement); and how many policymakers will dissent. Also Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its index of service-sector activity. The non-manufacturing index is forecast to edge up to 53.5, from 53.2. On Thursday, the release of third quarter productivity data is expected to show a 1 percent gain. On Friday, the October jobs report should give a sense of whether the labor market is gaining any momentum. Forecasters expect a continued modest gain in private payrolls, with 80,000 new jobs, but for total payrolls to decline by 60,000 as state and local government jobs are slashed. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 9.6 percent. "
1,"Continental Airlines Inc. and one of its mechanics were convicted in a French court of manslaughter Monday because debris from one of its planes caused the crash of an Air France Concorde jet that killed 113 people a decade ago. The Houston-based airline was ordered to pay Air France (EURO)1.08 million ($1.43 million) for damaging its reputation, in addition to a fine of around (EURO)200,000 ($265,000). The victims of the crash were mostly German tourists. The presiding judge confirmed investigators' long-held belief that titanium debris dropped by a Continental DC-10 onto the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport before the supersonic jet took off on July 25, 2000, was to blame. Investigators said the debris gashed the Concorde's tire, propelling bits of rubber into the fuel tanks and sparking a fire. The plane then slammed into a nearby hotel, killing all 109 people aboard and four others on the ground. Ronald Schmid, a lawyer who has represented several families of the German victims, said he was 'skeptical' about the ruling. 'It bothers me that none of those responsible for Air France were sitting in the docks,' he told The Associated Press by phone from Frankfurt. The airline and mechanic, John Taylor, were also ordered to jointly pay more than (EURO)274,000 ($360,000) in damages to different civil parties. Taylor was also handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence, and a (EURO)2,000 ($2,650) fine. All other defendants -- including three former French officials and Taylor's now-retired supervisor Stanley Ford -- were acquitted. The court said Taylor should not have used titanium, a harder metal than usual, to build a piece for the DC-10 that is known as a wear strip. He was also accused of improperly installing the piece that fell onto the runway. Continental's defense lawyer, Olivier Metzner, confirmed the carrier would appeal. He denounced a ruling that he called 'patriotic' for sparing the French defendants and convicting only the Americans. 'This is a ruling that protects only the interests of France. This has strayed far from the truth of law and justice,' he said. 'This has privileged purely national interests. Continental spokesman Nick Britton, in a statement, echoed that sentiment, and said the airline disagreed with the 'absurd finding' against it and Taylor. 'Portraying the metal strip as the cause of the accident and Continental and one of its employees as the sole guilty parties shows the determination of the French authorities to shift attention and blame away from Air France,' he said, noting that Air France was state-run at the time. Roland Rappaport, a lawyer for the family of Concorde pilot Christian Marty and a pilots union, said the verdict was 'incomprehensible' and asked why blame was heaped on Continental mechanics when French officials were aware of weaknesses on the Concorde around two decades before the crash. 'This trial made clear that the Concorde, this superb plane, suffered from severe technical insufficiencies, problems with the fuel tanks that were known since '79,' he said outside the courtroom. The fine delivered against Continental surpassed the (EURO)175,000 ($231,000) fine sought by a state prosecutor, who had requested 18-month suspended prison sentences for both Taylor and Ford. The prosecution also requested a two-year suspended sentence for Henri Perrier, former head of the Concorde program at former plane maker Aerospatiale. It argued for acquitting French engineer Jacques Herubel and Claude Frantzen, former chief of France's civil aviation authority. While France's aviation authority concluded the crash could not have been foreseen, a judicial inquiry said the plane's fuel tanks lacked sufficient protection from shock and said officials had known about the problem for more than 20 years. The families of most victims were compensated years ago, so financial claims were not the trial's focus -- the main goal was to assign responsibility. It is not uncommon for such cases to take years to reach trial in France. Continental is now part of Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc., which was formed in October as the holding company owner of United and Continental airlines, which will eventually be combined into a single airline. In France, unlike in many other countries, plane crashes routinely lead to trials to assign criminal responsibility. It is common for cases to drag on for years. In 2009, France's highest court finally confirmed the acquittal of all those originally accused of responsibility in an Air Inter crash that killed 87 people in 1992 -- 17 years earlier. ------ Kirsten Grieshaber contributed to this report from Berlin.

1,"Record-high water levels put the capacity of China's massive Three Gorges Dam to the test Wednesday after heavy rains raged on across the country, compounding flooding problems that already have left more than 1,200 people dead or missing. The dam's water flow reached 56,000 cubic meters per second (1.96 million cubic feet) Wednesday morning, the biggest peak flow this year with the water level reaching 518 feet (158 meters), the official Xinhua News Agency reported, about 10 percent less than the dam's maximum capacity. Chinese officials for years have boasted the dam could withstand floods so severe they come only once every 10,000 years. The dam is the world's largest hydroelectric project and was also built to end centuries of floods along the Yangtze River basin. Floods this year have killed at least 823 people, with 437 missing, and have caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, the State Flood Control and Drought Prevention reported. More heavy rains are expected for the southeast, southwest and northeast parts of the country through Thursday. Thousands of workers sandbagged riverbanks and checked reservoirs in Wuhan city in central Hubei province in preparation for potential floods expected to flow from the swollen Yangtze and Han rivers, an official with the Yangtze Water Resources Commission said Wednesday. He was surnamed Zhang but refused to give his full name as it common with Chinese officials. 'Right now, the Han river in Hubei province is on the verge breaching warning levels,' said Zhang. The Han is expected to rise this week to its highest level in two decades, Xinhua reported. Though China experiences heavy rains every summer, flooding this year is the worst in more than a decade, as the flood-prone Yangtze River Basin has seen 15 percent more rains than in an average year, Duan Yihong, director of the National Meteorological Center, said in a transcript of an interview Wednesday posted on the Xinhua website. 'Rains should begin to slow down in August, but it is hard to predict now what exactly will happen, said Duan. 'We have to be vigilant and closely monitor the weather ... do a better job of forecasting.' Thousands of rescuers in central China's Henan province searched for survivors on Wednesday after a bridge collapsed from heaving flooding in the Yi River over the weekend, killing 37 people with 29 missing, Xinhua reported. In the southern province of Sichuan, rescuers searched for 21 missing on Wednesday after a massive rain-triggered landslide buried 58 homes, Xinhua reported. "

1,"WASHINGTON - A majority of the Supreme Court on Tuesday seemed prepared to uphold a court order that California reduce the population of its overcrowded prisons by more than 40,000 inmates, despite dire warnings that 'people are going to die on the streets of California' if the release is approved. The state at one time incarcerated twice as many people as its adult prisons were built to hold. A special federal court panel found the conditions were unconstitutional and led to such poor medical treatment that one inmate died every eight days of ailments that could have been prevented or delayed. Washington lawyer Carter Phillips, representing the state in Tuesday's arguments, acknowledged that the conditions at times violated the Constitution. But he said the court panel was 'extraordinarily premature' in imposing the 'unprecedented' order to move out of prison 36,000 to 45,000 inmates over the next two years. He ran into immediate trouble with the court's more liberal justices. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said one of the lawsuits challenging the lack of health care was filed in 1990. 'How much longer do we have to wait?' she asked. 'Another 20 years?' Justice Stephen Breyer seemed shocked by photos from the crowded prisons, where bunk beds have taken over gymnasium floors and recreation areas, and medical facilities are located in former closets. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was Phillips's most aggressive questioner, replying skeptically, 'Oh, counsel,' to one of his points and telling him to 'slow down from the rhetoric' and detail how the state intended to fix conditions the lower court found. 'When are you going to avoid the needless deaths that were reported in this record?' Sotomayor asked. 'When are you going to avoid or get around people sitting in their feces for days in a dazed state? When are you going to get to a point where you are going to deliver care that is going to be adequate?' Phillips said the state has made 'significant progress' in correcting problems in recent years. The prison population has dropped from a high of 167,000 inmates to a total of about 147,000, he said. The suicide rate, once twice the national average, has fallen, as has the number of homicides in the system. But the reaction of Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the deciding vote between the court's liberal and conservative justices, was troubling for California's case. Kennedy said there was 'massive expert testimony' that the overcrowding has led to the unconstitutional conditions regarding medical care. The California court that dealt with the lawsuits 'has to at some point focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that, it seems to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision,' Kennedy said. The Supreme Court was considering for the first time a procedure passed by Congress in 1996 that made it more difficult for prisoners to file lawsuits about conditions. The law set up a system in which a three-judge panel could order a release of prisoners as a last resort. The California court panel said that the prison system could operate at no more than 137.5 percent of its capacity - it was built for 80,000 inmates - and still provide proper medical care It gave the state two years to make the changes, a goal Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, R, once thought was possible. But the legislature has resisted some of his proposals and has budgeted far less for prison construction than requested. Conservative justices questioned whether the panel in this case had followed all the dictates of the federal law. Chief Justice John Roberts seemed skeptical that the judges had paid enough attention to the requirement that any court- ordered remedy weigh heavily the effect on public safety. Justice Samuel Alito said he did not think the court found the necessary link between overcrowding and the unconstitutional conditions, and said the court's order would result in more crime. Donald Specter, a Berkeley, Calif., lawyer arguing the case for the inmates, said it was important to remember that the court had simply ordered the state to reduce the prison population, which could be done by placing some prisoners in county jails, sending some to out-of-state prisons, changing probation rules and other methods. 'The court is not ordering the state to throw open the gates of its doors and release people,' Specter said. 'If I were a citizen of California, I would be concerned about the release of 40,000 prisoners,' Alito replied. 'And I don't care what you term it.' Phillips picked up on Alito's concern in his closing remarks: 'I guarantee you that there is going to be more crime and people are going to die on the streets of California' if the order is upheld. "
1,"Germany on Wednesday rejected General Motors's request for $1.3 billion in aid for the loss-making Opel unit, forcing GM to seek other alternatives for the division's reorganization. Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said at a press conference in Berlin that he made the final decision not to give financial assistance after a government steering committee was unable to reach agreement. Bruederle said previously GM can afford to cover the costs itself because the Detroit-based carmaker has about $12 billion in free liquidity after fully paying back credits from the U.S. and Canadian governments. GM has been seeking $2.3 billion in aid from European countries to fund a restructuring that includes closing a factory in Antwerp, Belgium, as it eliminates 8,300 of Opel's 48,000 jobs. Europe was the only region where GM posted a loss in the first quarter. The carmaker recorded a $865 million net income in the period. Germany's refusal throws into question how GM will fund the $4.3 billion reorganization after abandoning an agreement backed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to sell a majority stake in Opel to Magna International Inc. last November. During the 18-month wrangling over Opel's future, which included bids from Italian automaker Fiat and RHJ International, Opel and its British brand Vauxhall have struggled to retain customers. 'Opel's drawn-out efforts to secure state aid has created a huge image problem,' Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg- Essen, said prior to the announcement. 'That loser image is going to stick.' Opel's European market share dropped to 7 percent from 7.6 percent in the first four months of 2010, even though the carmaker late last year introduced a new version of the Astra, its best-selling model, according to statistics from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. German lawmakers expressed concern about granting GM money as Merkel's government pushes ahead with planned budget cuts of more than 80 billion euros over the next four years. An outside advisory panel to the government that included former Schering AG Chief Executive Officer Hubertus Erlen and Michael Rogowski, the former head of Germany's main industry lobby group BDI, last week recommended that Germany turn down GM's application. GM filed for bankruptcy protection in June of last year and emerged a month later with Ed Whitacre as chairman. He took over as chief executive officer in December and has shuffled management and cut brands to four from eight. The company has since then repaid $8.4 billion in U.S. and Canadian loans it assumed as it emerged from bankruptcy. With assistance from Ola Kinnander in Stockholm. "

1,"Generous discounts lured American to stores for holiday gifts in November, providing cheer and robust sales gains for retailers. That raises hopes, already buoyed by reports of crowded malls, for a strong holiday shopping season. As retailers report their monthly results Thursday, it showed that many different types of shoppers were in the mood to buy, from the affluent to teens. Stores reporting gains that topped Wall Street expectations included Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp., the owner of Victoria's Secret and teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. That underscores that many people were not only buying gifts for others but throwing in items for themselves, including high-priced push-up bras and shoes. The results are based on revenue at stores opened at least a year and are considered a key indicator of a retailer's health. 'I feel it is going to be a solid holiday season,' said Madison Riley, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon Associates. 'Still, shoppers are being careful.' The strong results from November followed tepid sales in September and October, dragged down in part by unseasonably warm weather. Americans, however, are still cautious about spending and are sticking to budgets amid job worries. And there's still concern shoppers are done buying for now and will wait last minute for the best holiday deals. Encouraging economic signs may have consumers feeling better. Americans' income rose 0.5 percent in October, boosted by a 0.6 percent rise in wages and salaries, according to a government report released last month. That was after incomes didn't rise at all in September. At the same time, layoffs are slowing. Initial jobless claims dropped by 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 407,000 in the week ending Nov. 20, the Labor Department said. Claims have fallen in four of the past six weeks. The improvements helped to lift confidence to a five-month high in November, according to the Conference Board's monthly survey released Tuesday. Costco Wholesale Corp. reported a 9 percent increase in revenue at stores open at least a year. That was above the 6.2 percent estimate expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Target Corp. posted a 5.5 percent increase in revenue at stores opened at least a year, above the 3.7 percent estimate. Limited Brands reported a 10 percent increase, exceeding the 4 percent estimate from Wall Street analysts. Macy's Inc. reported a 6.1 percent; analysts had expected 5 percent. The department store chain raised its outlook for fourth-quarter earnings and revenue at stores opened at least a year. Teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch reported a robust 22 percent gain, far above the 6.8 percent estimate. "
1,"The angry faces at Tea Party rallies are eerily familiar. They resemble faces of protesters lining the street at the University of Alabama in 1956 as Autherine Lucy, the school's first black student, bravely tried to walk to class. Those same jeering faces could be seen gathered around the Arkansas National Guard troopers who blocked nine black children from entering Little Rock's Central High School in 1957. 'They moved closer and closer,' recalled Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine. 'Somebody started yelling, `Lynch her! Lynch her!' I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the crowd _ someone who maybe could help. I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat on me.' Those were the faces I saw at a David Duke rally in Metairie, La., in 1991: sullen with resentment, wallowing in victimhood, then exploding with yells of excitement as the ex-Klansman and Republican gubernatorial candidate spewed vitriolic white-power rhetoric. People like that old woman in Little Rock, the Alabama mob that hounded Autherine Lucy, the embracers of Duke's demagoguery in Louisiana, never go away. They were spotted last weekend on Capitol Hill under the Tea Party banner protesting the health-care-reform bill. Some carried a signs that read 'If Brown (Scott Brown, R-Mass., ) can't stop it, a Browning (high power weapon) can.' Some shouted racial and homophobic epithets at members of Congress. Others assumed the role of rabble, responding to the calls of instigating Republican representatives gathered on a Capitol balcony. Tea Party members, as with their forerunners who showed up at the University of Alabama and Central High School, behave as they do because they have been culturally conditioned to believe they are entitled to do whatever they want, and to whomever they want, because they are the 'real Americans,' while all who don't think or look like them are not. And they are consequential. Without folks like them, there would be no Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity or Pat Buchanan. There would never have been a George Corley Wallace, the Alabama governor dubbed by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Diane McWhorter in a 2008 Slate article as 'the godfather, avatar of a national uprising against the three G's of government, Godlessness, and gun control.' Hence, an explanation for the familiarity of faces: today's Tea Party adherents are George Wallace legacies. They, like Wallace's followers, smolder with anger. They fear they are being driven from their rightful place in America. They see the world through the eyes of the anti-civil rights alumni. 'Washington, D.C.' now, as then, is regarded as the Great Satan. This is the place that created the civil rights laws that were shoved down their throats. This is the birthplace of their much-feared 'Big Government' and the playground of the 'elite national news media.' And they are faithful to the old Wallace playbook. McWhorter wrote how Wallace, in a 1963 speech to the political arm of Alabama's Ku Klux Klan, 'referred to the recent bombings in Birmingham against prominent black citizens, citing the lack of fatalities as proof that the `nigras' were throwing the dynamite themselves in order to attract publicity and money.' Fast-forward to today. Note the pro-Tea Party conservative commentary debunking last weekend's racist and homophobic slurs as a work of fiction and exaggeration strictly for political reasons.Noticeable, too, is the influence of George Wallace, Limbaugh, Beck and their followers on outcomes. The angry '50s and '60s crowds threatened and intimidated; some among them even murdered. That notwithstanding, Americans of goodwill gathered in the White House to witness the signing of landmark civil rights laws. Schoolhouse doors were blocked, and little children were demeaned. Yet the bigots didn't get the last word. Justice rolled down like a mighty river, sweeping them aside. They insulted, abused, lied and vandalized. Still, President Obama fulfilled his promise to sign historic health-care reform into law by the end of his first term. Those angry faces won't go away. But neither can they stand in the way of progress. The mobs of yesteryear were on the wrong side of history. Tea Party supporters and their right-wing fellow travelers are on the wrong side now. It shows up in their faces. _ _ _ Colbert I . King writes a weekly column for The Washington Post. "
1,"More Americans than projected filed applications for unemployment benefits last week, a sign firings remain elevated even as the economy is expanding. Initial jobless claims jumped by 37,000 to 464,000 in the week ended July 17, exceeding the highest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor Department figures showed Thursday in Washington. The survey median projected claims would climb to 445,000. The number of people receiving unemployment insurance and those getting extended payments dropped. The figures underscore projections that a lack of jobs will restrain consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, and lead to slower growth in the second half of the year. It will probably take a 'significant amount of time' to restore the almost 8.5 million jobs lost in 2008 and 2009, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress Wednesday. 'Underlying demand for labor is fairly sluggish,' said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn., who had forecast claims would rise to 460,000. 'If that continues, it will have an impact on wages and salaries and clearly have some negative implications for consumer spending.' The rebound in part reflects the unwinding of decreases in the prior two weeks as fewer factories closed for mid-year retooling than the government estimated. The influence of the manufacturing closures will probably take another week or two to wash out of the numbers, a Labor Department spokesman said. The forecast was based on the median projection of 42 economists surveyed. Estimates ranged from 420,000 to 460,000. The Labor Department revised the prior week's figure to 427,000 from a previously estimated 429,000. The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than the weekly figures, climbed to 456,000 last week from 454,750, today's report showed. The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits dropped by 223,000 in the week ended July 10 to 4.49 million. The figure does not include the number of Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs. Those who've used up traditional benefits and are now collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about 368,000 to 3.93 million in the week ended July 3 after Congress failed to pass legislation extending the assistance. Thirty-four states and territories reported an increase in claims, while 19 reported a decline. These data are reported with a one-week lag. Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls report -- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in recent months as some companies continue to cut staff, while others expand, pointing to an uneven recovery. Thursday's report reflects jobless applications for the week the Labor Department will survey employers to tabulate July payrolls. In June, private employers added fewer workers than projected by economists, while overall payrolls fell, reflecting a drop in federal census workers. It may take years to recoup the loss of jobs during the recession that began in December 2007, economists said. The unemployment rate, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1 percent in October 2009, will end 2010 at 9.5 percent, the same as in June, according to this month's Bloomberg survey.

1,"Editors: Enrollment of veterans is surging at America's college campuses, but as a group they don't feel supported and understood, according to a national survey. Researchers with the National Survey of Student Engagement interviewed nearly 11,000 student veterans who were first-year students or seniors at four-year schools. The veterans reported interacting less with their instructors than did classmates who had not enlisted, and they were less likely to partake in educational opportunities such as internships or study abroad. The Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research produces the survey each year to measure how students and faculty interact and learn. The latest, results of which will be released Thursday, found that colleges should 'seek ways to more effectively engage student veterans in effective educational practices and provide them with the supportive environments that promote success.' Transitioning from military life to civilian life is difficult enough, but trying to fit in on a college campus is 'a culture shock that's hard to adjust to,' said Michael Dakduk, the deputy executive director of Student Veterans of America, which has chapters on more than 300 campuses. Other factors can also make veterans feel disconnected: They are more likely to transfer between schools or to enroll part time, the survey found. One in five combat veterans reported having a disability, compared with one in 10 non- veterans. Veterans also spend more time working or caring for a family than do traditional college students. Still, the veterans reported just as many hours studying as their peers. 'What amazes me is how many people are succeeding, despite the obstacles,' Dakduk said. Colleges need to realize that student veterans are different from typical students and need more support, said Brian Hawthorne, who served two tours in Iraq for the Army and is a graduate student at George Washington University in political management. Hawthorne said veterans need administrators who understand the 'depth and breadth' of the complicated GI Bill and can help students graduate in less than four years. 'The veteran experience is not one that most people know,' he said. 'I could pay anyone to go to college. ... It's the services that keep veterans in school.' "
1,"To some here, the boarded-up windows and empty storefronts of Main Street present commercial promise. So for weeks Roger Jones mustered up his friendliest phone voice and dialed businesses from Boston to California with a single question: Would you consider setting up shop in Ottumwa? He was lucky to get a call back _ even luckier if the person on the other end didn't laugh out loud in response. But as executive director of the Ottumwa Economic Development Corp., he has decided to try again, because 'even during the roughest time, we try to move forward and make things happen. That's all you can do.' The usually fruitless and possibly quixotic task embodies both the desperation and optimism of this plucky factory town, which was part of President Barack Obama's three-state, two-day swing through the Midwest. Town leaders have tried everything to attract employers and rejuvenate the town, even raising money to open a Video Game Hall of Fame, envisioning a sort of Midwestern Cooperstown. Yet unemployment remains at 9.5 percent, and the median family income is around $30,000. More than half of public-school children here qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches. The downtown is desolate, with a perky coffee shop here, a lively comic book shop there and lots of papered-over glass in between. Last year, John Deere, one of the region's larger employers, laid off 500 workers from its Ottumwa plant. Many of those workers were rehired five months later; nevertheless, the move sent a jolt through the community, which had felt protected from the problems that had devastated places like Detroit. 'There's a lot of despair out there,' said Mayor Dale Uehling. The town had been recovering slowly from decades of battering by the foundering manufacturing sector when the recession came and wiped away much of that hope. Obama is seeking to restore that hopeful feeling on his Midwest trip, which began Tuesday in Fort Madison, Iowa, and ends Wednesday in Quincy, Ill. The president plans to point to new economic ventures intended to revitalize the rural business economy, including tax credits to spur the production of clean energy and an export plan that relies on improving trade opportunities for small businesses. Few here said, though, that Obama would be able to inspire much confidence with just his presence. His last visit to the town was in December 2007, just before the presidential caucuses that jump-started his campaign. Many here believe his trip is a nod, a sort of thank-you status update, to the momentum he gained with that first victory. But he will face a tougher audience than he did during his last trip _ in no small part because times are now much tougher. On Sunday night, dozens of families filed into the First Pentecostal Assembly of God to watch Dizzy the Clown deliver a spiritual message, in the form of magic tricks and slapstick comedy. In the audience was Rhonda Warner, 45, and her two young sons, getting a much-needed distraction. Warner, an in-home caretaker for people with mental disabilities, fell so behind on her mortgage payments that she lost her home _ a reality that brought tears to her eyes as the boys raced across the stage after the show. She makes too much money to qualify for government assistance, she said, so she turned to the church, which is helping her move into her new rental. 'I hope I can make rent,' she said, cracking a dark joke. 'If nothing else, my Aztek's a good sleeping car.' There is also an abiding fear in Ottumwa that Obama's policies may be hindering the recovery and that the federal government is intruding too far into people's personal lives. Uehling believes that the anxiety is testing the longstanding ties people here have to the Democratic Party. 'I want to ask him why we pay so much in taxes and we're beginning to become a communist country,' said Maria Glackin, 45, a former meatpacker. She stood in line with hundreds of others Monday morning for free tickets to Obama's town- hall meeting Tuesday at the local community college. Residents are taking their economic good news where they can find it: The Cargill Meat Solutions plant has not laid off any workers. The U.S. Department of Labor is building a Job Corps center nearby, which is expected to create hundreds of jobs. And great hopes are pinned to a proposed casino. The casino is called Rippling Waters because, like a stone tossed into the Des Moines River, its success is anticipated to radiate out and touch every corner of the community. 'I think we have weathered the storm. The clouds will soon be drifting away,' said Jones, dressed in a suit and tie in his Ottumwa Economic Development Corp office. He has handed over the phone-calling duties to an intern from Indian Hills Community College, whose two weeks of calls have yielded about 15 or 16 'good prospects,' mostly chain restaurants, he said. 'We'd love to get an Outback Steakhouse kind of thing,' he said. "
1,"Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said President Obama assured her in a meeting in the Oval Office Thursday that he would send White House staff to her state to talk with Arizona and local officials about efforts to secure the border with Mexico. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the Republican governor said her talk with the president was cordial, despite their disagreement over the widely criticized state law she signed in April giving police greater powers to enforce immigration rules. She said that Obama declined to discuss whether the Justice Department plans to file a lawsuit to block the law before it takes effect next month. But she called her meeting with the president a victory, saying she 'has more today than I had yesterday,' referring to the commitment that White House staff will visit Arizona. The meeting came as Brewer responded to news reports that she had embellished the circumstances of her father's death, saying erroneously that he had died fighting the Nazis. In fact, he died of illness in California in 1955. In a statement, Brewer said that 'my father, Wilford Drinkwine, moved our family before I was born from Minnesota to Nevada to work at the Hawthorne Ammunition Depot in Western Nevada at the outset of World War II. He passed away when I was 11 years old. His death came after a long and painful battle with lung disease, contracted following years of exposure to hazardous chemicals and toxic fumes while working as a civil servant at the base.' Thursday's meeting was the culmination of weeks of public disagreement between Brewer and Obama about the intent and the impact of the new Arizona law. The White House said in a statement that the meeting went well and that Obama reiterated his concerns with the law, including that a patchwork of different state immigration regulations would complicate the federal government's role in setting and enforcing immigration policy. The statement said Obama would like Brewer to work with him to help pass comprehensive changes to the immigration system that would provide a path to citizenship for those already in the country illegally. In a briefing to reporters, press secretary Robert Gibbs said that, in particular, the president hoped Brewer would help persuade Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to support broad immigration legislation as he did several times earlier this decade. 'I doubt we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform if we don't have John McCain doing what he did during those years,' Gibbs said. But as she was leaving the White House, Brewer said the border must 'be secured' before she could partner with Obama on broad immigration legislation. "
1,"Privacy or safety first? Since the attempted terrorism attack aboard a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas Day, the Obama administration has been scrambling to review airport security procedures. And some are calling for the reexamination of a controversial device known as the whole-body imaging scanner, which, shall we say, leaves little to the imagination about what a traveler looks like in the nude. Besides former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff, at least one group wants President Obama and policymakers to give the scanners a chance: the U.S. Travel Association, which represents the industry. 'Whole-body imaging may or may not be a panacea for security and travelers, but one thing that is clear is that this technology has not received the necessary analysis to determine if it can significantly strengthen security and improve travel facilitation,' Roger Dow, the association's president and chief executive, said in a statement last week. 'Nearly all of the WBI focus to date has been on privacy. It is past time for a more detailed analysis.' The group urged the administration to adopt techniques that strengthen screening while balancing travelers' right to privacy and allowing them to travel hassle- free. In addition to whole-body imaging, the group also backs increased use of canine security. Some experts agree that the time for more aggressive screening has come. Douglas Laird, a former security director with Northwest and president of a Nevada-based security consulting firm, supports the association's request that the scanners be looked at more closely. 'I'm a proponent,' he said, 'for the simple reason that it's the only way you can find what you're looking for.' Laird is less enthusiastic about using dogs at airports. For one thing, he said, they can work only so many hours a day. And they're no match for a crafty would-be terrorist who knows how to manipulate an explosive device so that it gives off no scent. 'The normal person wouldn't know how to seal an (explosive device) and cleanse it, but these guys aren't average people,' he said. 'These guys are engineers; they know how to do it.'

1,"Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said Tuesday that the municipality is putting off a plan to demolish homes built without permits in an Arab neighborhood slated to be the site of a new archaeology park. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked Barkat Tuesday to 'allow more time for efforts to reach an understanding with the residents' and warned of 'elements which are interested in sowing strife and discord' over the city's plan. 'This is a plan that takes into consideration the needs of the residents,' Barkat said in a press conference in Jerusalem's city hall. 'There are extremists who whatever we do will try to twist the plan and accuse us of wrongdoing.' The demolition of unauthorized Arab construction in parts of Jerusalem has been a source of tension between Israel and the international community, including the United States and European Union. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in August that 'the eviction of families and demolition of homes in East Jerusalem is not in keeping with Israeli obligations.' Ir Amim, a group that advocates on behalf of Arab property rights in the city, said in an e-mailed statement that demolishing homes in the east Jerusalem Silwan neighborhood 'to clear the area for an archaeological garden will be a dangerous step, which could ignite one of the most volatile areas, and damage the stability and political future of Jerusalem.' Barkat had said that Arab residents evicted from homes that are to be demolished in Silwan would be offered housing elsewhere in the area. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and subsequently annexed it, a move that has not been recognized by the international community. Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. "
1,"Sarah Palin has proved that she can draw a crowd. What she has yet to demonstrate is that she can translate the appeal of a phenomenon into a political force that can attract or mobilize sizable numbers of voters. The former Alaska governor is the Republican Party's biggest celebrity. She has given voice to a grass-roots movement grounded in anger with Washington and President Barack Obama's policies. But her political future remains in question. Is she presidential timber? A force only within the Republican Party? A protest candidate like George Wallace (minus the racial divisiveness) or Ross Perot? 'Sarah Palin will have to choose to be either the leader of a movement or the leader of a nation. She can't be both,' said Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. 'Right now, she is a figure like (George) McGovern or (Barry) Goldwater, two candidates who led the most intense movements in our country's political history, but who couldn't win the middle.' If Palin harbors presidential ambitions, she has a huge mountain to climb. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 71 percent of Americans do not think the politician who was Sen. John McCain's running mate in 2008 is qualified to be president. Those numbers are so daunting that some Republicans who otherwise admire what she has accomplished doubt that she will run in 2012. Others say that unless she can transform attitudes dramatically, she cannot hope to win a general election. Still, GOP strategist Phil Musser said, 'if she ran for president today, she would be the Republican nominee.' Musser's comments are notable because he is an adviser to Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who is eyeing a 2012 candidacy of his own. Palin's political future remains 'very much an open question,' Musser said, 'but the intensity that she brought to the ticket in 2008 hasn't faded, and one could argue that perhaps it's been enhanced.' The news media clearly cannot get enough of Palin. Her speech to the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville last weekend was carried live by the three major cable news channels. Her declaration the next morning on 'Fox News Sunday' that she would not close the door to a 2012 campaign drew headlines everywhere, even though it did not represent a significant change in her position. But she is more than catnip for the press and blogs. The tea party convention crowd gave her a rousing reception. The next day she drew about 8,000 people in a campaign appearance for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is in a high-stakes Republican primary race against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Perry adviser David Carney said that Palin's appearance was 'the largest Republican primary event in the history of the state' and that the audience was built 'without one dime of ads, mail or phone calls, just through social media, e-mails and the earned media off of that.' Across the state, he said, 'the coverage was wall to wall.' That she is a force within the party is indisputable, but her power is not easily quantifiable. She has taken sides in several GOP primaries _ in Texas, Kentucky, Arizona (for McCain) _ but how much those endorsements have meant in extra support isn't clear from the polls. Democrats regard Palin as mostly a Republican problem, someone capable of throwing the Washington political community into a lather with a Facebook posting or a tweet, but not yet a credible potential presidential candidate or leader of a broad-based opposition. They also think her embrace of the tea party movement is as risky as it is beneficial for the GOP because it puts the party too much on the side of anger and could turn off middle-of-the-road voters who want more bipartisan cooperation. Palin has many detractors, even within the GOP. They deride the content of her tea party speech as being long on grievance but short on substance. They mock her for the notes scribbled on her palm during that appearance and what they see as inconsistencies in her statements. But as one GOP strategist, who declined to be identified in order to speak more freely about her, put it, 'Palin has a following that is thoroughly uninterested in experiences on issues and instead is completely motivated by attributes. They'll take her authenticity over her ideas every day of the week.' 'No matter what she does, she has an important role in the Republican Party,' said Fred Malek, who has advised Palin over many months. 'She relates to and embraces the grass roots in a way nobody else does.' For those thinking of running for the GOP nomination in 2012, Palin's presence must be noted but not engaged politically or substantively. 'To do anything, to go out and challenge her, just does not make any sense right now,' said another Republican strategist who is advising a prospective 2012 candidate. The risk, this strategist said, is that a candidate could alienate voters who, if Palin does not run, will be looking for someone else. 'And it's clear she holds a grudge and doesn't forget it,' he said. But the others should be paying close attention, Castellanos said. 'Mitt Romney, Pawlenty and every other Republican contender ought to be worried,' he said. 'An authentic, populist voice has emerged as the anti-Obama and that voice doesn't belong to the Republican establishment. It belongs to Sarah Palin.' Since leaving the governorship last summer, Palin has taken steps to expand her political operation, which was derided even by those in the Republican Party as thin and inexperienced. Tim Crawford, who has been working in GOP politics for 30 years, serves as the treasurer of her political action committee. Others who are helping include Randy Scheunemann, who offers foreign policy advice as he did during her vice presidential campaign. Longtime adviser Meg Stapleton continues to serve as principal liaison to the news media. Palin told 'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace that she receives a daily e-mail from advisers outlining domestic and international developments. Asked by Wallace if she is more knowledgeable about domestic and foreign affairs now than she was two years ago, she replied: 'Well, I would hope so. Yes, I am.' Palin continues to express surprise to some of those close to her about the attention she attracts, most recently her tea party convention experience. But she is keenly aware, they say, of the poll numbers that show her as unelectable in a general election at this point. Where there is disagreement is in reading between the lines of her recent activities to discern whether there is a budding candidacy in the works or the playing out of something that has brought Palin national celebrity and commercial success. Some strategists see her efforts as intended to make sure that the door to a candidacy remains open until she is ready to make the decision. Others interviewed for this story think she is not doing all she can or should to develop relationships in key states, either during her book tour or on other travel. 'When she was on her book tour, people wanted to meet with her, but she didn't do any of that,' said one person who has been watching her closely. A recent Gallup poll showed a wide-open race for the Republican nomination in 2012. Asked to name their preferred candidate, 14 percent of Republicans named Romney; 11 percent said Palin. But 42 percent offered no opinion, and the rest were scattered among a slew of other candidates. As for the widespread lack of confidence in her ability to be president, one adviser said Palin has time to turn that around if she decides she wants to run in 2012. Another Republican said that if she chooses not to run, she can play an influential role in determining who wins. For now, she remains the Wasilla, Alaska-based mother who is rapidly becoming the embodiment of the anger and disenchantment that has been rising since Obama took office. As good as that might make people feel, that is far from a willingness to entrust their futures, and the country's, to her. 'Her challenge is to fill in the substantive blanks in a way that demonstrates that capacity, without losing her uniqueness and her role as provocateur,' said Tom Rath, a GOP strategist who has been part of Romney's political team. 'Not easy.' "
1,"KARACHI, Pakistan - Pakistan's deadliest floods in decades have killed more than 1,500 people and overwhelmed government efforts to provide aid, officials and relief workers said Monday. With President Asif Ali Zardari touring Europe, the government said it was rushing help to the devastated northwestern province, where the army has fought Taliban guerrillas. Islamic militant groups in the region and the United States both have built public support in the past by providing assistance to bolster government attempts. Monsoon rains will continue for the next few days after ripping out bridges, roads and villages since late last week, said Nasir Khan, a Meteorological Department official in the provincial capital, Peshawar. Regions downstream in the Indus River valley, where most of Pakistan's 162 million people live, braced for floods that may damage crops, according to the nation's biggest agriculture body. More than 1,500 people have died in Pakistan's northwestern province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said Noor Muhammad, a press officer for the provincial development ministry. Government and private relief agencies are managing to provide 'only 5 percent of what's required,' Mujahid Khan, provincial spokesman for the Edhi Foundation, which runs Pakistan's largest ambulance and rescue services, said by phone from Peshawar. Pakistani television channels showed flood survivors gathered at roadsides, seeking transport to nearby towns. Pakistani soldiers in the flood-scoured Swat Valley 'are rescuing people from the water by helicopter,' said Zahid Khan, 55, president of the hotel association in Mingora, the valley's main town. 'But the government has sent no help for people who lost their homes and they are camping wherever they can with no drinking water,' he said by phone. Islamic militant activists distributed aid packages in the northwestern town of Charsadda, outside Peshawar, the Associated Press reported. An earthquake in 2005 that killed about 86,000 people exposed the government's inadequacy in providing relief as the U.S. and Islamic militants raced to fill the gap. U.S. Air Force cargo planes landed in the city of Rawalpindi Sunday with food packages as part of $10 million in emergency help pledged by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She has sought to boost her country's image among Pakistanis as an opinion survey released last week by the Pew Research Center in Washington showed only 17 percent of the local population had a positive view of the U.S. The U.S. is rushing helicopters, boats, pre-fabricated bridges, mobile water treatment units and food supplies to affected areas, Clinton said in a statement Sunday. Food distribution has begun in the worst affected districts of Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsadda, the World Food Program said Sunday on its website. Floodwaters 'have also caused significant damage' to the United Nations agency's warehouses in northwestern Pakistan, it said. The flood's death toll may rise to 3,000, said Edhi Foundation's Khan. He spoke from Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, previously called the North- West Frontier Province. Officials in Pakistan's other provinces -- Punjab, Sindh and Baluchistan -- braced for the floodwaters moving down the Indus River and its tributaries. The Sindh government ordered residents evacuated from locales along the Indus. The floods, which according to British charity Oxfam may be Pakistan's worst in 35 years, may cut the production of rice, sugarcane and corn by about 10 percent to 15 percent, said Nasir Cheema, president of Pakistan's Chamber of Agriculture. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, a two-time prime minister, criticized Zardari for pursuing a trip to France and Britain this week. His absence flies in the face of 'the worst flooding in the country's history,' Sharif said on the GEO television news channel. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, who toured the stricken province by air, ordered the government to provide food to people at safe locations. The floods followed the deaths of 152 people when a plane crashed in heavy rain near the capital, Islamabad, on July 28. "
1,"The Obama administration is considering partially lifting its suspension of all transfers of Guantanamo Bay detainees to Yemen, officials said, following a federal court ruling that found 'overwhelming' evidence to support a Yemeni's claim that he has been unlawfully detained by the United States for more than eight years. The case of Mohammed Odaini has become so pressing that senior administration officials, including the secretaries of defense and state, or their deputies, will discuss it next week. A White House official stressed that any decision 'should not be viewed as a reflection of a broader policy for other Yemeni detainees.' 'What isn't being considered is lifting, in a blanket fashion, the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because deliberations are ongoing. The administration, though, may come under further pressure to quickly release Yemenis besides Odaini. As many as 20 more Yemenis could be ordered released by the courts for lack of evidence to justify their continued detention, a second administration official estimated. The official said the government may have to periodically carve out an exception to its ban. 'There is a group of Yemenis who are going to win their habeas cases,' the official said. 'Some of them will not be as clear as this case, but some will be and that poses a real dilemma.' Odaini was a 17-year-old student at a religious institution in Faisalabad, Pakistan, in March 2002 when he accepted an invitation to spend the evening at a nearby guesthouse that he had never before visited. He ended up spending the night, and after Pakistani authorities raided the house overnight, they turned Odaini and a number of other men over to the United States. The government argued 'vehemently' that Odaini's presence in the guesthouse demonstrated that he was part of 'the al-Qaeda affiliated network of man named Abu Zubaydah,' according to the court opinion. But a federal judge was unconvinced. 'The evidence before the court shows that holding Odaini in custody at such great cost to him has done nothing to make the United States more secure,' wrote U.S. District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., ordering Odaini's release in an opinion that was unclassified this month. 'There is no evidence that Odaini has any connection to al Qaida. ... The court therefore emphatically concludes that Odaini's motion must be granted.' In January, following the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound plane traveling by a Nigerian suspect who received training in Yemen, Presdient Obama suspended all transfers of detainees to Yemen. A month earlier, Republicans had strenuously objected to the repatriation of six Yemeni detainees. An inter-agency task force Obama created has cleared 29 Yemenis for repatriation and conditionally cleared another 30 if security conditions in Yemen improve. Most are likely to stay at Guantanamo for some time. But Odaini's case presents a particular challenge to the administration, and those on Capitol Hill who are opposed to any transfers to Yemen. 'This is a bad case to argue. There is nothing there. The bottom line is: We don't have anything on this kid,' said the administration official. 'The judge wants a progress report by June 25th. We have to be able to report something other than we are thinking about it.' In previous cases where Yemenis have been ordered released, the government has appealed. But the administration official said it would be 'unconscionable' to appeal in this case. Since his capture, Odaini was recommended or approved for transfer out of Guantanamo by various military or government officials in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2009, according to Kennedy's judgment. But he remained at Guantanamo Bay. The administration official said there are now basically two options in the case: either repatriate Odaini, the son of a retired Yemeni security official, or quickly find another country willing to resettle him. The second option may be complicated, however. Odaini's 'strong preference' is to return home, according to his lawyer David Remes. And countries that have so far resettled Guantanamo detainees have only accepted those who had nowhere else to go and who wanted to be resettled. There are about 90 Yemenis held at Guantanamo Bay, the largest single group by nationality among the 181 detainees held at the military detention center. Administration officials fear that the Yemen government, which does not control all of its own territory and is facing a terrorist threat from a splinter group called al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, is not able to ensure that released detainees do not return to the fight. Advocates for some of the Yemeni detainees say they do not pose a security risk. Asked if there were other cases as stark as Odaini's, his lawyer, Remes, said he was 'certain of it.' 'Why the government fights so tenaciously to keep men such as Mr. Odaini in prison unless and until the government sees fit to release them is the great mystery of this litigation, especially since President Obama took office,' said Remes, who represents 14 Yemenis held at Guantanamo Bay. 'They seem unable to admit they've ever made a mistake.' "
1,"Kraft Foods Inc. plans to reduce sodium by an average of 10 percent over the next two years for North American brands including Oscar Mayer and Velveeta. Kraft's move follows similar efforts by Campbell Soup Co. and ConAgra Foods Inc. Northfield, Ill.-based Kraft is cutting salt levels in more than 1,000 products, Susan Davison, a spokeswoman, said Wednesday by telephone. Sodium levels in Oscar Mayer bologna are to be reduced by 17 percent. Some flavors of Easy Mac Cups, microwaveable macaroni and cheese with as much as 29 percent of the daily sodium intake recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, are to see a drop of 20 percent. 'It's good for consumers, and, if done properly, it's good for business,' Rhonda Jordan, Kraft's president of health and wellness, said in a statement. 'A growing number of consumers are concerned about their sodium intake and we want to help them translate their intentions into actions.' Some products, like Grey Poupon mustard and Crystal Light beverages, will not be changed because they are already low in sodium, Davison said. A serving of Grey Poupon Dijon mustard has 5 percent of the FDA's recommended daily intake of sodium, according to the company's Web site. Kraft has more than 100 products with either low, reduced or no sodium, including Hint of Salt Ritz crackers, she said. The food industry may face sodium limits from the federal government if it doesn't voluntarily reduce salt content in processed foods, said Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an editorial published this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine. American adults consume an estimated 3,900 milligrams of sodium a day -- more than twice the maximum recommended by U.S. government dietary guidelines, according to a Stanford University study published in the same journal. In a survey last summer of consumers by market researcher Mintel, 25.7 percent said they always watched their salt intake, compared with the 24.2 percent who said they always watch sugar. In the United States, 4.1 percent of new food and beverage products had reduced, low or no sodium this year through March 17, compared with 2.5 percent in 2007, Chicago-based Mintel said. Campbell, the world's biggest soup maker, said it has more than quadrupled the number of products with lower sodium levels to more than 110 since 2005, the Camden, New Jersey-based company said in January. Campbell reduced sodium in more than 90 soups, including its condensed tomato soup, and V8 vegetable juice drinks. ConAgra, the Omaha, Neb.-based maker of Healthy Choice frozen dinners and Hunt's ketchup, said in October that it would cut a fifth of the salt in its products by 2015 as it tries to meet consumer demand for healthier food.

1,"A judge sentenced a couple to the maximum 14 years in prison for unnatural acts and gross indecency Thursday under Malawi's anti-gay legislation. The harsh sentence had been expected after the same judge convicted Tiwonge Chimbalanga and Steven Monjeza earlier this week under laws dating from the colonial era. Chimbalanga, a 20-year-old hotel janitor, and his unemployed partner were arrested Dec. 27, the day after they celebrated their engagement with a party at the hotel where Chimbalanga worked -- an apparent first in Malawi. Michelle Kagari, deputy Africa director of Amnesty International called the sentence 'an outrage.' Her rights watchdog has adopted Chimbalanga and Monjeza as prisoners of conscience, and would 'continue to campaign on this matter and to work tirelessly to see that they are released unconditionally as soon as possible,' Kagari told The Associated Press by telephone from her office in Kampala, Uganda. Malawi's government has been defiant in the face of international criticism over the couple's prosecution. Homosexuality is illegal in at least 37 countries in Africa including Malawi. In Uganda, lawmakers are considering a bill under which homosexuals could be sentenced to life in prison and 'repeat offenders' could be executed. Even in South Africa, the only African country that recognizes gay rights, gangs have raped lesbians. Gay people forced underground in Africa are unlikely to seek counseling and treatment for AIDS, activists say. In Malawi, nearly 1 million people -- an estimated 12 percent of the population -- are living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. "
1,"President Barack Obama is finding it tough to deliver on big campaign promises to the gay community but is looking to reaffirm a commitment to their priorities. On the eve of a major gay-rights rally, Obama planned to address thousands of gays and lesbians at a fundraising dinner Saturday night for the Human Rights Campaign, the s largest gay-rights group in the U.S. A White House spokesman says Obama will outline the progress he hopes to achieve for the gay community in the coming weeks and months. Since Obama took office in January, some advocates have complained that Obama has not followed through on promises on issues they hold dear and has not championed their causes from the White House, including ending the ban on gays serving openly in the military and pushing tough nondiscrimination policies. 'I'm disappointed because I think a lot of us, particularly a lot of us young people, believed that we would see quick and decisive change, and now I think we're facing the reality that it's not that way,' said Kip Williams, a co-director of the National Equality March, which is expected to draw thousands of gay and lesbian activists to the National Mall on Sunday. 'I am not satisfied by dreams and visions. I want to see real commitments, and I would be pleased if I heard Obama make a real commitment with a timeline,' he said. In the past, Obama has urged the gay community to trust him. In June, he pointed to some initial efforts, such as a presidential memorandum he issued that expands some federal benefits to same-sex partners. On Saturday night, Obama is also expected to cite hate-crimes legislation that he wants to see Congress pass quickly for his signature. Still, it's a far cry from his biggest promises. Obama publicly has committed himself to repealing the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy that allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they don't disclose their sexual orientation or act on it. But Obama hasn't taken any concrete steps urging Congress to rescind the policy, and his national security adviser last weekend would only say that Obama will focus on overturning it 'at the right time.' Obama also pledged during the campaign to work for repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which limits how state, local and federal bodies can recognize partnerships and determine benefits. But lawyers in his administration defended the law in a court brief. White House aides said they were only doing their jobs to back a law that was already on the books. The gay community is somewhat split as to whether Obama should be expected to produce results right away. The Human Rights Campaign, which invited Obama to speak at its dinner Saturday night, said it remains hopeful of seeing more action. 'He's obviously the most supportive president and has done more than any president' on behalf of the gay community, said Joe Solmonese, the group's president. He said the Obama administration has been working with the group on a range of issues 'on an almost weekly and sometimes daily basis.' Rep. Barney Frank, an openly gay member of Congress, notes there has been some progress such as the hate-crimes legislation, which would make it a federal crime to assault people because of their sexual orientation. Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, also said the gay rights community understands 'there is a legislative process' and progress can't happen overnight. ------ On the Net: Human Rights Campaign: http://www.hrc.org National Equality March: http://equalityacrossamerica.org/ "
1,"Stocks finished an erratic session mixed Tuesday as higher commodity prices lifted energy and materials shares. The meager advances were enough to push stocks to new 13-month highs, though more shares fell than rose at the New York Stock Exchange. The market had zigzagged for much of the day on mixed news from retailers and on industrial production. A rebound in the dollar after three down days kept investors' appetite for stocks in check. A long-term weakening trend in the dollar since March has been lifting commodities prices and shares of U.S. exporters, which benefit from stronger foreign demand for their goods when the dollar falls. Record-low U.S. interest rates have also driven investors to seek higher returns in stocks and commodities, pushing share prices higher. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, and trading volume remained light. Traders focused on retailers' earnings reports for insight into one of the market's biggest worries: how much consumers are spending. Home Depot Inc., Saks Inc. and Target Corp. all reported better-than-expected third-quarter results but also said they remain cautious ahead of the holiday shopping season. 'Despite the dramatic rally in the stock market, we still see the consumer operating at recessionary levels,' said Uri Landesman, chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at ING Investment Management in New York. Better retail news pushed stocks higher Monday as a government report showed a rebound in overall sales in October. Investors are looking for signs that consumer spending, one of the biggest drivers of the U.S. economy, will recover during the holiday season. A report on industrial production weighed on the market. The Fed said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent in October, less than the 0.4 percent predicted by economists polled by Thomson Reuters. Meanwhile, signs of inflation remained muted, a positive signal for the economy. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, rose less than expected in October. The 0.3 percent rise was smaller than economists' forecasts of 0.5 percent and followed a decline of 0.6 percent a month earlier. 'The market is saying inflation is not an issue,' said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Oklahoma City-based Burns Advisory Group. He said that's a signal interest rates will remain low. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. It was the highest close for the Dow since Oct. 2, 2008, when it ended at 10,482.85. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78. Falling stocks narrowly outpaced those that rose on the NYSE, where volume came to 972 million shares compared with 1.1 billion Monday. Stocks jumped Monday on the bigger-than-expected rebound in retail sales in October. The Dow rose 136 points and the S&P closed above the 1,100 level for the first time in more than a year. The Dow is up 725 points, or 7.5 percent, this month. That has some analysts saying the market has been rising too fast given problems like unemployment still facing the economy. For the year, the Dow is up 18.9 percent after rebounding from a 12-year low in March. A bounce in crude helped energy stocks for a second day Tuesday. Crude oil rose 24 cents to settle at $79.14 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold climbed 20 cents to $1,139.40. Gains in other metals fanned gains of materials companies. Platinum jumped $17.90 to $1,459 an ounce. Bond prices edged higher to push yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.33 percent from 3.34 percent late Monday. Home Depot fell 66 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $26.99, while Saks rose 26 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $5.67. Target fell $1.52, or 3 percent, to $48.77. Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. tumbled $1.13, or 22.6 percent, to $3.88 after its sales forecast fell short of expectations. Meanwhile, Jacobs Engineering Inc. fell $6.61, or 14.5 percent, to $38.88 after the company's fourth-quarter earnings slid 31 percent and the company's forecast fell short of expectations. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.53, or 0.1 percent, to 602.34. "
1,"WASHINGTON - Not all accused priests spend years in limbo. Some, such as Russell Dillard, are removed immediately. Dillard, now 62, was a faith adviser to then-Washington Mayor Anthony Williams and pastor of St. Augustine's in Northwest Washington, the city's oldest black Catholic congregation, in 2002 when two sisters accused him of kissing and fondling them when they were teens. He was suspended within days of the allegations, removed from the ministry five months later and eventually defrocked. No criminal or civil charges were leveled against him. After he was defrocked, Dillard received a master's degree in social work from Catholic University and now has a job advising people trying to get health care, friends said. At one point, they said, he was engaged, but he didn't marry. Kathryn Barrett-Gaines, 45, one of the sisters who accused Dillard, said she was 'floored' to hear about his new position serving others. 'This is not some hotshot job, and he loves to be the hotshot,' she said. 'I don't think he's evil. He just doesn't have empathy, which is why he shouldn't be a priest,' said Barrett-Gaines, a history professor at the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore and a member of her parish council. 'I'm just glad he's not a teacher or a doctor.' Dillard remains a practicing Catholic. He goes to post-worship coffee hour a few Sundays a month at St. Martin of Tours in Washington, parishioners there say. 'He is still well loved,' said Octavia Jackson, who was married by Dillard in 1990. 'Those who come around him, talk with him, don't have ill feelings or will about the allegations. Those who did believe [the accusations] just don't say anything.' "
1,"In the Manhattan neighborhood of Elena Kagan's youth in the 1960s and 1970s, drug addicts and prostitutes conducted their business minutes from the doormen and marbled lobby of the her childhood home. The future Supreme Court nominee's mother, a schoolteacher, and father, an attorney, were typical residents of the Upper West Side's grand boulevards. Three blocks away in Sherman Square, a scrap of greenery where Broadway crosses Amsterdam Avenue, heroin was being sold in the open, a scene memorialized in Jerry Schatzberg's 1971 movie 'The Panic in Needle Park' starring Al Pacino. 'One of the advantages of growing up in New York in those days was that you saw a broad swath of life just walking down the street,' said Margaret Raymond, 50, a high school friend of Kagan's who worked as a law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall a year before Kagan did. 'Her worldview includes a wide range of experience just because of what she saw and where she lived.' Kagan, 50, who is President Barack Obama's solicitor general, hasn't spoken much about her childhood and isn't granting interviews as she awaits Senate confirmation hearings. According to Raymond, Kagan and their peers at Hunter College High School had high aspirations and expectations. The school was a 'place full of people who might be Supreme Court justices,' Raymond said. 'This was really a place that was full of smart, serious young women who were going places in life.' In a November 1980 article in Princeton University's school newspaper as Ronald Reagan won the presidency, Kagan said she absorbed her liberal principles early in life and bemoaned Democratic losses at the polls. 'Where I grew up -- on Manhattan's Upper West Side -- nobody ever admitted to voting Republican,' she wrote. In the late 1960s, residents of the Upper West Side, which stretches from the west side of Central Park to the Hudson River, marched down Broadway, Manhattan's longest thoroughfare, carrying candles and their children, to call for an end to the Vietnam War. The Village Voice dubbed the neighborhood the Upper Left Side for its liberal political views. 'It wasn't the expensive place to live that it is now,' said Lawrence Block, the novelist whose character Bernie Rhodenbarr, a gentleman thief and used bookseller, lives in a fictional apartment at 71st Street and West End Avenue, four blocks from where Kagan lived as a young girl. As hard drugs reached Manhattan, chunks of the Upper West Side near Kagan's home turned 'really nasty,' Block said in a telephone interview. Schatzberg used junkies who hung out a block from Kagan's home as extras in his film. 'They pointed out which buildings they go into to buy drugs and where they'd shoot up half a block away,' he said in a telephone interview from his own Upper West Side home. The Upper West Side was 'decrepit and getting worse,' said architectural historian Christopher Gray, who also lived there. 'Very, very gritty,' is how Olga Statz, 45, described the area when she was growing up. She remembers abandoned buildings, slums, street crime and rent strikes, announced with red lettering on white sheets hanging from windows. Statz, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, bought plantains at local bodegas, knew the proprietors of the corner stores and saw Caribbean natives and Latinos living alongside Jews from Central Europe and Chinese immigrants. 'It was the world in a few blocks,' said Statz, who lived at 101st Street and Broadway and later at 94th and Amsterdam. 'That is something I've never seen again, anywhere.' Raymond recalls wandering the city with Kagan as a girl, holding long conversations in the coffee shops that then dotted the neighborhood. Long before Starbucks arrived, she saw her first cappuccino at Cafe La Fortuna on West 71st Street, and tasted cakes at the Eclair pastry shop, where New York magazine said in 1971, 'Mitteleuropa gathers at 4 p.m. to revive the afternoon with coffee and pastries.' 'We were New York kids,' said Raymond, who was a year ahead of Kagan at Hunter College High School, where Kagan's mother, Gloria, taught for many years in the elementary school.

1,"The Glashaus hotel used to be a symbol of the regeneration of one of Dublin's toughest neighborhoods. Empty and shuttered, it now represents one of the toughest economies Ireland has ever endured. Developer Liam Carroll opened the boutique hotel in Tallaght in the west of the city three years ago at the height of the country's decade-long real estate boom. Now, creditors have taken control of much of Carroll's empire and the Glashaus is closed, as is the nearby 186-room Tallaght Cross Hotel. 'It's a game of last man standing,' said Paul Gallagher, president of the Irish Hotels Federation in Dublin. 'When corporate traffic slowed up and the recession took hold, very quickly it became obvious we had an enormous problem.' At least 200 hotels opened during Ireland's decade-long economic boom, leaving a glut of rooms and mountain of debt as the number of visitors dwindles. While some establishments cut their losses and shut, others are lowering prices to stay in business and avoid repaying tax breaks if they were to close. Irish hotel occupancy slumped to about 54 percent in 2009, the lowest level since the early 1980s, as the economy fell into its worst recession on record, the hotels federation said. In 2007, the height of Ireland's boom, the figure was 64 percent. The numbers of trips to Ireland fell 20 percent in the two years through June 2010, the Central Statistics Office said Friday. Hotels have almost $9 billion in bank borrowings, according to figures from the industry group. Sixty percent of hotel loans at Allied Irish Banks, the country's second-largest lender, are classed as 'criticized,' either closely watched or in trouble, Managing Director Colm Doherty said Aug. 4. Britain's Lloyds Banking Group, among the biggest lenders to Irish hotels, said this month it's pulling out of Ireland. The economy will grow 1 percent this year after contracting about 11 percent in the last two years, Ulster Bank in Dublin forecast on Thursday. Unemployment will rise to 13.3 percent this year from 11.8 percent in 2009. Many hotels that opened as Ireland's economy tripled in size between 1997 and 2007 were given tax breaks provided they remained open for at least seven years. Such hotels are slashing prices in a bid to stay open, undermining longer- established venues, said Joe O'Flynn, owner of the Rathsallagh Country House Hotel, south of Dublin. 'It's a zombie plague,' O'Flynn said. 'I can't compete. If that happens do I join the zombies?' In other cases, banks are keeping alive hotels to avoid crystallizing losses on loans, hoteliers said. Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, created by the government to purge banks of risky real-estate loans, has taken control of 48 loans secured on hotels. In the latest batch of loans, hotels accounted for 23 percent of the assets bought by the agency. 'The big problem that the industry faces at the moment is that banks are keeping hotels open that would not normally survive,' said Charlie Sheil, manager at Dublin's four-star Gibson Hotel. 'They are being propped up by the banks, which is causing major damage to a lot of the good hotels.' The Gibson, whose heated rooftop terrace looks out over the city's docklands area, opened two months ago with a special rate of $127 per room per night. It considered pushing back its opening until later in the year, Sheil said. Back in west Dublin, two brown velvet chairs block the revolving doors of the Tallaght Cross, the centerpiece of a vacant office and retail development. It may not be the last to go, said Gallagher at the Irish Hotel Federation. 'It's inevitable,' Gallagher said. 'If the sector is going to survive, some hotels are going to have to go.' "
1,"Led by veteran forward Miroslav Klose, Germany opened its Euro 2012 campaign with a 1-0 victory over Belgium. Klose scored his 53rd goal for Germany when Bastian Schweinsteiger robbed Belgian defender Daniel Van Buyten of the ball and fed Thomas Mueller, who served Klose for the easy putaway. Despite the Belgian error, it was the quickness of execution of players who found each other seemingly blindfolded which impressed. It was a goal made by Bayern Munich players, from Belgium's Van Buyten to Klose, and gave Germany the early lead in Group A. The World Cup semifinalists, who showed some of the flowing play that marked their South African campaign, plays Azerbaijan on Tuesday in Cologne. Belgium plays Turkey next. Turkey beat Kazakhstan 3-0 to share the lead with Germany, 'They were too dominant a team. We were powerless to get a draw,' said Belgian captain Thomas Vermaelen. Belgium pressured early on, but progressively the Germans took control and never let go. After the defensive blunder which gave Germany the goal, they closed their defense off and had the cool and poise to keep the Belgians running after the ball. Overall though, Germany fell short of its World Cup form which saw it produce some of the most sparkling football of the tournament in spectacular wins over England and Argentina. ------ Lineups: Belgium: Logan Bailly; Toby Alderweireld, Daniel Van Buyten, Vincent Kompany, Thomas Vermaelen; Marouane Fellaini, Timmy Simons (Jelle Vossen, 83), Jan Vertonghen; Moussa Dembele, Romelu Lukaku (Christian Benteke, 73), Eden Hazard (Olivier Deschacht, 73). Germany: Manuel Neuer; Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker, Holger Badstuber, Marcell Jansen (Heiko Westermann, 46); Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger; Thomas Mueller, Mesut Oezil (Cacau, 88), Lukas Podolski (Toni Kroos, 70) , Miroslav Klose.

1,"The Security Council has voted unanimously to extend the U.N. peacekeeping mission in East Timor for a year and is endorsing plans to reduce its police contingent ahead of a possible withdrawal. The resolution adopted by the council on Friday supports Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's intention to gradually reduce the number of international police from 1,608 to 1,280 by mid-2011, as East Timor's own police force resumes responsibility. The council asked Ban to submit a report on plans for the U.N. police drawdown by Oct. 15 and another report by Jan. 26, 2011 with possible adjustments in the mission's mandate and strength. East Timor's Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Guterres told the council on Tuesday the government agrees with Ban that the mission should remain in the country until 2012. He expressed hope that it could be wrapped up at that time. "
1,"India's industrial production grew more than 10 percent for a sixth straight month in March, adding to inflation pressures even as Europe's debt crisis threatens to undermine the global economic recovery. Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 13.5 percent in March from a year earlier after gaining 15.1 percent in February, the statistics department said in a statement in New Delhi Wednesday. The median estimate of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 15.1 percent increase. The risks to global economic expansion has prompted Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao to say he will raise interest rates in a 'calibrated' manner to curb inflation. The approach is now winning the support of economists such as Kotak Securities's Mridul Saggar, who had said earlier that the central bank isn't aggressive enough in slowing inflation, which accelerated to 9.9 percent in March. 'The developments in Europe have vindicated the RBI's approach of gradualism in monetary tightening, something which economists like us were worried about as growth had recovered very strongly in the Indian economy,' Saggar said. 'We still expect a further rate hike of 25 basis points or more in July.' European policy makers on May 10 unveiled an unprecedented loan package worth almost $1 trillion and a program of bond purchases to contain a sovereign-debt crisis emanating from Greece. While the developments in Europe may have limited impact on India, policy makers are carefully monitoring the situation, Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said Monday. Subbarao on April 20 raised the central bank's benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the second time in a month, increasing the reverse repurchase rate to 3.75 percent and the repurchase rate to 5.25 percent. The next monetary policy statement is scheduled for release on July 27. Factory output is gaining strength in India as wages rise, spurring demand for houses and cars. Salaries in India may grow at the fastest pace in the Asia Pacific this year, according to Hewitt Associates Inc., the Lincolnshire, Ill.-based human resources adviser. India's $1.2 trillion economy may have grown 8.6 percent last quarter, the fastest pace in more than two years, Kaushik Basu, the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, said on May 4. Faster economic expansion has helped the benchmark Sensitive Index to gain more than 40 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange in the past year, and the rupee to advance 8.5 percent during the period. The yield on the key 10-year government bond has advanced 39 basis points to 7.96 percent since Jan. 1 as demand outstrips supply, stoking inflation. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition is under pressure to control rising prices. Inflation provoked opposition parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party to move a motion in parliament this month, challenging the government to prove its majority. Singh defeated the motion after receiving support from regional parties. "
1,"Auxerre beat Le Mans 2-1 with a stoppage-time goal from Benoit Pedretti to take the provisional lead in the French league and put pressure on Bordeaux. Pedretti scored the winner in the first minute of injury time after taking a pass from Dennis Oliech. Poland forward Ireneusz Jelen had given Auxerre the lead in the 25th minute, tapping home a cross from Oliech for his 10th goal of the season. Thorstein Helstad equalized for Le Mans with a header in the 89th. 'We made perhaps a mistake with our marking for the equalizer,' Auxerre coach Jean Fernandez told Europe 1 radio. 'We were telling ourselves that it was stupid to concede a goal in the last minute. 'But we didn't give up. We took advantage of the momentum which has been carrying us in our last few matches. If we continue that good run, why not a European spot at the end of the season?' Auxerre has 55 points from 29 matches, two clear of Bordeaux which has played two fewer games. Montpellier is level on points with Bordeaux, followed by Lille and Lyon which have 51 points each. Le Mans dropped to 19th place with 21 points. Also Saturday it was: Boulogne 2, Lorient 0; Rennes 4, Toulouse 1; Grenoble 0, Monaco 0; Nice 1, Paris Saint-Germain 0; Saint-Etienne 0, Nancy 0; and Lens 0, Sochaux 0. In Boulogne, Damien Marcq dribbled past goalkeeper Fabien Audard to score the opener in the 13th. The host made it 2-0 in the 52nd with an own goal from Lorient defender Laurent Koscielny, who deflected a shot from Olivier Kapo into his own net. Lorient slipped to ninth place with 43 points while Boulogne kept alive its chances of escaping relegation, narrowing the gap to the safety zone to six points. Rennes started its rout when Petter Hansson headed a freekick into the top corner to put the host ahead in the 31st. Asamoah Gyan doubled the lead in the 35th on a counterattack, and the Ghana forward then netted his 12th goal of the season to make it 3-0 from close range after a pass from Jimmy Briand in the 46th. Daniel Braaten pulled a goal back for mid-table Toulouse with a curling shot in the 51st before Jires Kembo-Ekoko sealed the win for Rennes in the 91st with a powerful strike. Rennes jumped to seventh place with 46 points. In Grenoble, the host held on to earn a point despite going down to 10 men after goalkeeper Jody Viviani was sent off for handling the ball outside his area in the 80th. Grenoble remained in last place with 15 points while Monaco moved into eighth place with 44 points. Nice also improved its chances of staying in the top flight after Loic Remy netted his 11th goal of the season with a header in the 79th from a cross by Anthony Mounier. The match was played behind closed doors as the French league decided to punish Nice for the behavior of its supporters, who ran across the pitch in January to clash with Monaco fans. Nice stayed in 16th place with 32 points but moved closer to securing safety whereas PSG remained in 12th place with 37 points. On Sunday, Bordeaux hosts Lille, Montpellier faces Valenciennes and Lyon visits Marseille. "
1,"If imitation is the highest form of flattery, the 'tea party' movement must be honored. In an effort to replicate the tea party's success, 170 liberal and civil rights groups are forming a coalition that they hope will match the movement's political energy and influence. They promise to 'counter the tea party narrative' and help the progressive movement find its voice again after 18 months of floundering. The large-scale attempt at liberal unity, dubbed 'One Nation,' will try to revive themes that energized the progressive grassroots two years ago. In a repurposing of Barack Obama's old campaign slogan, organizers are demanding 'all the change' they voted for _ a poke at the White House. But the liberal groups have long had a kind of sibling rivalry, jostling over competing agendas and seeking to influence some of the same lawmakers. In forming the coalition, the groups struggled to settle on a name. Even now, two of the major players disagree about who came up with the idea of holding a march this fall. In this respect, at least, the liberal effort already resembles the fractious tea party movement. In February, some tea party groups skipped a long-planned gathering in Nashville in protest of alleged profiteering by convention organizers. Tea partiers have also argued about which candidates represent the movement. Despite the friction among liberal groups, the effort behind 'One Nation' was born of a certain necessity: At one of the first meetings, Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, said, 'Raise your hand if you can push your part of the agenda all by yourself.' No hands shot up. Indeed, a promised overhaul of immigration law is virtually dead this year. Legislation that labor unions say would make it easier for them to grow their membership are stalled in Congress. The jobless rate is 15.4 percent for blacks and 12.4 percent for Hispanics, compared with 8.6 percent for whites. 'Having been confronted with the specter of the tea party ... we felt it urgent to organize the majority of this country, which voted in 2008 and has gone back to the couch,' said Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP. 'We've been split off in different directions.' The groups involved represent the core of the first-time voters who backed President Obama _ including the National Council of La Raza, NAACP, AFL-CIO, SEIU and the United States Student Association. (The effort is separate from the Democratic Party's plan to spend $50 million trying to reach those same voters.) Their aha moment happened after the health-care overhaul passed this spring. Liberal groups, who focused their collective strength to push the bill against heavy resistance, felt relevant and effective for the first time in a long while. That health-care coalition _ composed of civil rights groups, student activists and labor leaders _ liked the winning feeling. 'In many ways, the bitter fight for health-care reform has painfully highlighted that we must go back to the grassroots organizing that won us the election in the first place,' said George Gresham, president of 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. 'We must reassert our strength as the social movement that ushered Obama into office.' Liberal leaders see 'much of the progressive agenda at risk in this election,' said Paul Starr, a professor of public affairs at Princeton University and co- editor of the American Prospect, a liberal magazine. 'There is no choice but for these groups to get together. The historical pattern is that voter turnout falls disproportionately among minorities and young people at these midterm elections, so they are fighting a historical trend.' Leaders of the groups have been meeting for about three months in a planning process that some participants called arduous, debating everything from the name of the coalition to what the branding and logo should look like. The coalition's first goal is to plan a march to 'demonstrate to Congress that these agenda items have support across multiple demographics,' Jealous said. The demonstration, to be held Oct. 2, will center on pressing for more government spending on job creation. 'This is a way to create some intensity,' said Eric Rodriguez, vice president of NCLR. 'Month after month, we spend time pointing to these employment figures, and we're still not breaking through on the disparities in a way that we think is important.' This week at their national conventions both NAACP and NCLR leaders will begin talking to their members about 'One Nation,' and they are seeking money from foundations for the effort. They hope it will be a show of force that will remind both Congress and the White House that they are out there. Obama, who some activists say has not lived up to their expectations, could also be pushed harder, said Michael McGerr, a professor of history at Indiana University who has studied political campaigns. The effort has a historical parallel in a story that Obama has told on the campaign trail. According to the story, when labor organizer and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph met with President Franklin Roosevelt to press his issues, Roosevelt told Randolph he agreed with him but that Randolph should 'go out and make me do it.' 'They are calling the Democratic party back to what has been the pattern of successful liberalism in the 20th century,' McGerr said. "
1,"Portia de Rossi has officially taken wife Ellen Degeneres' last name. A Los Angeles Superior Court commissioner granted De Rossi's request to take the last name of her partner during a closed hearing Thursday. The television star will now legally be known as Portia Lee James DeGeneres. The couple was married in August 2008. The 37-year-old Australian-born actress asked for the name change last month. Neither woman attended the hearing. They married during the five-month window in which gay marriage was legal in California. Portia DeGeneres is well-known for her roles on several television series, including 'Ally McBeal,' 'Arrested Development' and 'Better Off Ted.' "
1,"Defense Secretary Robert Gates has directed the military to delay the Lockheed Martin F-35 program, cutting planned purchases by 10 aircraft in fiscal 2011 and a total of 122 through 2015, according to a budget document. More than $2.8 billion that was budgeted earlier to buy the military's next- generation fighter would instead be used to continue its development. The delay is a setback for both Gates and Lockheed. The defense secretary said last year he wanted to accelerate jet purchases to complete the military's most expensive weapons program sooner and possibly save money. For Lockheed, the world's largest defense contractor, accelerated purchases would be more profitable because a program's production phase brings in more revenue than research and development. In addition, the company faces negotiations that may require it to absorb a share of cost overruns during what will likely be an extended development phase. The company now absorbs no overrun costs. Along with the delay in Lockheed's program, Gates is calling for spending a total of $2.4 billion in 2011 and 2012 to buy 26 F/A-18E/F planes that are capable of jamming enemy radar. Those aircraft are produced by Boeing, the second-largest defense contractor. Navy officials warned that if the F-35 program slipped, they'd press for more F-18s to mitigate a 'fighter gap' caused by their aging, carrier-based jets. Gates' order is in an unreleased document he signed Dec. 23 that is the basis for the new defense budget to be released Feb. 1. The document was widely distributed within the Pentagon, including the military chiefs, inspector general, the intelligence agencies and regional combat commanders. Gates cut the planned purchase of F-35s by 10 planes in 2011 to 42; by 17 in 2012 to 45; by 52 in 2013 to 77; by 20 in 2014 to 90; and 23 in 2015 to 107, according to the document made available to Bloomberg News. He directed the shift from the procurement budget to development of $320 million in fiscal 2011; $544 million in 2012; $716 million in fiscal 2013; $872 million in fiscal 2014 and $356 million in 2015, according to the document. The document gives no indication that the program's target quantity would be cut. The planes bought through 2015 would be used for training, testing and to fill the first operational squadrons. The F-35 is intended to replace the F-16, A-10, AV-8 Harrier jets and earlier model F-18s. The F-35 program's current projected cost is $298.8 billion. The plan is to build by 2034 at least 2,456 U.S. aircraft with common parts for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Gates' decision appears to have been influenced by several independent assessments commissioned by the Pentagon, said Thomas Christie, who was in charge of the Defense Department's weapons testing from 2001 to 2005. One recent study agreed with a similar one from a year earlier that predicted a 2 1/2 year delay in development beyond the current target of October 2014 and an added cost of $16.5 billion. The new estimate recommended the Pentagon add $314 million to the five-year plan to beef up testing. Gates did so. A separate review of Lockheed's manufacturing raised questions about the company's ability to meet its schedule for assembling the plane. The deferral of buying 122 aircraft reflects concerns 'about Lockheed Martin's ability to produce aircraft at the previously planned rate,' Christie said in an interview. 'I have to compliment' Gates 'for stepping up to the plate as opposed to once again letting the program go on as previously planned, with its clearly unexecutable cost and schedule profile,' he said. Lockheed Martin spokesman Chris Giesel said the company understood the Pentagon was revaluating F-35 program funding and 'this may have implications' for purchases in 'fiscal 2011 and beyond.' Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to comment on what he said was pre- decisional budget material. "
1,"Police say a woman's body has been found in a forest in southwestern Germany near where a banker's wife was kidnapped last month. Police said Friday that the body hadn't yet been identified. German news agency DAPD reported that a man walking his dog Thursday night found the body, which had been covered with branches. Maria Boegerl was seized from her home in Heidenheim in May. The kidnapper then contacted the 54-year-old woman's husband, Thomas, an executive with a local bank, and demanded a ransom of (EURO)300,000 ($368,000), according to German media reports. Police say Thomas placed the ransom money at the side of a highway but it was never picked up. More than 100 officers and helicopters spent days searching for Boegerl. "
1,"Supreme Court justices signaled Tuesday that they are likely to uphold a national law that permits the civil commitment of 'sexually dangerous' people after they complete their federal prison terms. Hearing arguments in Washington, most of the nine justices suggested they viewed Congress as having the constitutional power to enact the law. A federal appeals court said the 2006 measure, under which more than 100 people have been held, exceeded Congress's authority. The case tests the power of the federal government to play a role in preventing sex crimes, traditionally a state function. Although the high court has reined in the federal government in other contexts over the past 15 years, Tuesday's hour-long hearing revealed more concern about ensuring public safety than interest in protecting states' rights. 'You are talking about endangering the health and safety of people,' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. 'The government has some responsibility, doesn't it?' Justice Antonin Scalia alone voiced criticism of the statute, repeatedly saying the federal government was intruding on state powers. He said federal prison officials could accomplish the same goal by notifying state authorities when a dangerous person is about to be released and asking them to begin commitment proceedings. 'I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter,' Scalia said. He characterized the Obama administration's arguments in favor of the law as 'a recipe for the federal government taking over everything.' The law, part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, directs the attorney general to 'make all reasonable efforts' to persuade states to assume responsibility for the custody and treatment of committed people. The civil commitment law is being challenged by five men held under the measure. Four of them have completed prison sentences for sex crimes, while the fifth was held incompetent to stand trial on charges of sexually abusing a child. They are being held in a treatment facility in Butner, N.C. Before the law's enactment, the federal government's civil commitment power covered people in U.S. custody who were found incompetent to stand trial, found not guilty by reason of insanity or determined after conviction to be mentally ill. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, the Obama administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, said the commitment power stemmed from 'the power to run a responsible criminal justice system.' Her argument resonated with Justice Stephen Breyer, who said that government-run hospitals on occasion need to restrain people for their own protection or that of someone else. 'Once you are down the road where you admit the government can do that, how is a prison any different?' he asked G. Alan DuBois, the lawyer representing the men. Similarly, Justice John Paul Stevens likened the commitment of sexually dangerous individuals to the quarantining of federal prisoners who have tuberculosis. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito also hinted with their questions that they were likely to support the government. "

Cummins had taken over from John Carver, who quit in frustration midseason and returned home to England. Toronto FC has not reached the playoffs in its three seasons in the league. "
1,"MSCI may have been more instrumental in changing investor behavior toward Israel than an eight-year-old divestment campaign by some Harvard and MIT academics. The index provider's decision to move the country to a developed nations index prompted Harvard University, T. Rowe Price and Eaton Vance to sell a combined $210 million in Israeli stocks from their emerging markets investments last quarter, according to Bloomberg estimates. Funds focusing on mature economies have been slow to buy the shares because Israel accounts for just 0.4 percent of the developed markets index, compared with about 3 percent of MSCI's emerging markets measure. 'Israeli stocks might be in no-man's land for a while,' said John Derrick, the director of research at San Antonio-based U.S. Global Investors. 'It's small enough in the developed market index to avoid altogether,' said Derrick, whose firm's Global Emerging Markets Fund sold 9,346 shares of Israel Chemical during the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sales have hurt returns of Israeli stocks, with the Tel Aviv 25 Index trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI EAFE index of developed non-U.S. markets since it was upgraded on May 27. Derrick said the country may attract new funds after a transition period because it has stronger economic growth than other developed markets. The MSCI upgrade, a plan made public more than a year ago, reflects diminished concern by investors over geopolitical risks when buying Israeli stocks, according to Frank Nielsen, an executive director for the New York-based company. Israel had already satisfied developed market criteria related to economic sustainability, market size and liquidity, and market accessibility. None of the asset managers said they sold the shares for political reasons. In 2002, professors and students from Harvard and the neighboring Massachusetts Institute of Technology called on the schools to divest from Israel and from U.S. companies that sell arms to the country, to protest the occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel. The petition, organized by academics including Nancy Kanwisher, a brain and cognitive sciences professor at MIT, was signed by 132 faculty members from both institutions, including Noam Chomsky, a linguistics and philosophy professor at MIT. Chomsky, in an e-mail, said while he supported the 'general thrust' of the petition, he criticized it for excluding 'countries with far worse criminal records,' including the U.S. The Tel Aviv 25 index returned 2.5 percent in the year after the petition, compared with a 15 percent decline by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. In the eight years since the petition was announced and before Israel's promotion, the gauge returned an annual average of 14 percent, excluding dividends, beating the 13 percent average of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. "
1,"Staggered by the scale of destruction from this summer's catastrophic floods, Pakistani officials have begun to acknowledge that the country's security could be gravely affected if more international aid does not arrive soon. The floods have submerged an area roughly the size of Italy, displaced 12 percent of the population and destroyed billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and crops. But with the government admittedly overwhelmed and foreign aid only trickling in, the worst may be still to come, as Pakistan struggles to deal with food shortages, disease outbreaks and a mass migration of homeless families. All those factors have the potential to further destabilize a nation undermined by weak governance and a vicious insurgency even before the crisis. 'There are already signs that people are restive,' said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, a military spokesman. 'If not addressed, it could balloon and will create a security situation in the areas where the government has not taken care of people's needs.' The army has had to reorient in recent weeks, shifting its focus from counterinsurgency and toward relief and recovery missions. A potential offensive in the militant haven of North Waziristan has been placed on indefinite hold, as has the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of refugees from last fall's battle in South Waziristan. Meanwhile, efforts to rebuild the Swat Valley, the scene of intense fighting last year, are back to square one after flooding from monsoon rains knocked out every bridge and many schools, health clinics and communications towers. 'The so-called war on terror has to be on hold,' said Ayaz Amir, a security analyst and a member of Pakistan's parliament. 'As long as the nation, the government and the army are dealing with this flood situation, the war takes a back seat.' That is bad news for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, where commanders seeking to turn around a flagging war effort are relying heavily on Pakistani cooperation. It could particularly affect plans in eastern Afghanistan, where the United States had been contemplating a fall offensive in areas directly across the border from North and South Waziristan. So far, the Pakistani Taliban has not made any visible efforts to exploit the crisis. Although some Islamic charities linked to banned militant groups have distributed aid in certain areas, the Taliban itself has remained relatively quiet since the flooding began three weeks ago. Abbas said there was no indication that the group was mobilizing for major attacks, and analysts said Taliban operations could have been hamstrung by the floods. The Taliban may also be wary of alienating the public by carrying out strikes at a time of mass hardship. 'We can do with a lull on both sides,' Amir said. But it's not clear that the lull will last. The floods have inundated some of the poorest and least accessible areas of Pakistan, many of which were already fertile recruiting grounds for militants. Some heavily affected areas of Swat can be reached only by helicopter, and residents are building wooden bridges by hand to reestablish links to the outside world. Southern parts of Punjab province, too, have been heavily affected, exacerbating the threat from Taliban affiliates that have been moving quickly in recent years to expand their influence beyond Pakistan's northwest. The center of militancy in Pakistan remains North Waziristan, and while it was not among the worst-hit parts of the country, the army's focus on the floods means any operation there is now extremely unlikely. 'The government is face to face with massive problems from the flood. There are millions of displaced people. If they go for the operation in North Waziristan, there would be many more,' said M. Kamran Khan, a member of parliament representing North Waziristan. 'It's not possible for the government to take care of more people.' Even before the floods hit, Pakistan had been reluctant to move into North Waziristan, despite months of intense U.S. pressure. Whereas South Waziristan was home to the Pakistani Taliban, militant groups in the north _ including al- Qaeda and the Haqqani faction of the Taliban _ have generally been friendlier toward the Pakistani government and have focused their attacks across the border in Afghanistan. Abbas, the military spokesman, said the United States has stopped pressuring Pakistan to go into North Waziristan, recognizing that such a move could backfire if undertaken when the army is overstretched. 'They have a better understanding now of our concerns and our constraints,' he said. 'For the near future, there's too much on our plate. We're totally involved in responding to this disaster.' Gains made in South Waziristan have also been put in jeopardy by the floods. The army declared victory there late last year after weeks of battling insurgents, but residents have yet to return, and the army says plans to escort them back have been delayed. Out of Pakistan's 500,000-man army, approximately 60,000 troops are involved in flood-related rescue and relief work. So far, those troops have been called up from the reserves or from training and have not been pulled from active military operations. But with the flood response taking up critical resources, including helicopters, the army is clearly constrained. 'There is now a lot of breathing space for the Pakistani Taliban and their allies in the tribal areas,' said Hasan-Askari Rizvi, a political and defense analyst. 'They know they will soon be able to cash in on the ammunition that develops as the people are alienated from the government.' That alienation is already apparent. The government says it is doing everything it can to provide flood victims with food, water and shelter, but it admits it does not have nearly enough resources to help the estimated 20 million people affected. In recent days, Pakistanis rendered homeless by the floods in the southern province of Sindh have taken to the highway in protest, blocking traffic and setting fires. Across the country, fights have broken out among increasingly desperate aid recipients as they compete for every sack of flour and bottle of water. The United Nations said Tuesday that money and supplies are both in short supply and that only about a third of the $459 million in emergency funds it asked for last week had arrived. The World Bank redirected $900 million worth of previously committed loans to flood recovery on Tuesday, but aid groups continued to plead for money that can be used immediately to help those at risk. The United States has provided $87 million in flood assistance, more than any other country. Meanwhile, even stalwart allies of Pakistan such as China and Saudi Arabia, have been slow to provide funds. 'We have a country which has endemic watery diarrhea, endemic cholera, endemic upper respiratory infections,' said Daniel Toole, UNICEF's regional director for South Asia, at a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday. 'We have the conditions for much, much expanded problems.' "
1,"The author of a book unusually critical of China's premier said Wednesday it will be published this month in Hong Kong despite police threats that he could be put in prison. Yu Jie said the book, titled 'China's Best Actor: Wen Jiabao,' is meant to show the vast difference between the image the premier projects in public -- he has called himself 'Grandpa Wen' -- and his hard-line policies. 'This is a completely deceptive way to speak to people,' Yu said in an interview Wednesday. Yu, 36, is a former best-selling author whose books are now banned in China. He helped found the Independent PEN Center in China which fights for freedom of expression, and is a vocal Christian who has angered authorities with his outspoken defense of religious freedom. Yu said he discussed the book with U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman during a meeting Tuesday about freedom of expression and other topics, after an invitation from the embassy. 'He was very interested in the book and asked detailed questions,' Yu said. An embassy spokesman confirmed the two met. Yu said the book will be published Aug. 16 in Hong Kong, a former British colony that enjoys freedom of the press as part of its special semiautonomous status. The publisher is Bao Pu, who earlier this year tried to publish a memoir purportedly written by Li Peng, China's premier in 1989 when authorities cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Bao dropped the idea because of copyright problems. 'I'm certainly very concerned. I told him I don't want him to get arrested for publishing this book,' Bao said of Yu. 'But he doesn't seem very concerned.' Bao is the son of Bao Tong, a top aide to late Chinese Communist Party General-Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was purged for opposing military action in Tiananmen and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. Bao Tong wrote the introduction to Yu's book. 'The leaders and the led, everyone is passing their days inside a contradiction,' Bao Tong wrote in the introduction, titled 'The Virtual China and the Real China,' saying Wen is the best example, the best actor. In Wednesday's interview, Yu used Wen's response to the devastating Sichuan earthquake in 2008 as an example. Wen was the first top official at the scene, where he cried, comforted families, and told the parents of crushed children the government would find out why buildings, especially schools, collapsed, Yu said. 'But already two years have passed, and there's nothing,' Yu said. 'Instead, volunteers who investigated the collapsed buildings have been arrested and sentenced.' Police detained Yu last month after word of his book spread online. Yu said he was questioned for more than four hours, mostly about the book's contents. 'The state security people said Wen Jiabao isn't a normal citizen, he's the premier, so criticizing him hurts the nation's interests and security,' Yu said at the time. '(They said) I could be given a heavy sentence like Liu Xiaobo.' Liu, also an author-dissident, is currently serving an 11-year sentence on charges of inciting to subvert state power. Yu said China's policies under Wen and President Hu Jintao are more hard-line in such cases than under previous leader Jiang Zemin. Under international and especially U.S. pressure, several political prisoners were released under Jiang, but no one has been released under Hu and Wen, he said. 'If Wen doesn't agree,' Yu said of his book, 'he can write an article to disagree.' ------ Associated Press Writer Isolda Morillo contributed to this report. "
1,"Foreign governments, longtime Democratic fundraisers, entertainers and thousands of individuals gave money to former president Bill Clinton's charitable foundation in 2009, according to a list of donors the foundation released Friday under an agreement with President Barack Obama to prevent the appearance of conflicts with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role as secretary of state. Some foreign governments that had been multimillion-dollar donors in the past, including Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Kuwait and Qatar, did not give in 2009, which was Hillary Clinton's first year in the Cabinet post. But other governments continued their giving, including Norway, which has given between $10 million and $25 million over the past several years, and Oman, whose donations have totaled between $1 million and $5 million. Also among the 19,047 donors from last year are Slim-Fast founder and billionaire Democratic donor S. Daniel Abraham, who has given the Clinton Foundation between $5 million and $10 million; Canadian mining tycoon Frank Giustra, who has given more than $25 million; and Scottish financier Sir Tom Hunter, whose foundation has donated between $10 million and $25 million. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also gave money in 2009 and ranks among the top donors, having given more than $25 million. 'I am deeply grateful to the many generous contributors who made it possible for my foundation to accomplish so much in 2009, including increasing the number of people on lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, helping cities reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and inspiring millions of children to lead healthier lives,' Clinton said in a statement. The list designates whether donors gave money in 2009, but only details the total of their giving since the charity began raising money in 1998. It could not be determined how much each donor gave in 2009 alone. Some prominent Clinton Foundation supporters did not give money last year, including Hollywood magnate Stephen Bing and upstate New York businessman Tom Golisano, each of whose past donations total between $10 million and $25 million. Citigroup, the banking firm that has received federal bailout money, is a past supporter but did not donate in 2009. Among the list's more unusual donors is Richard Scaife, a conservative media baron who bankrolled anti-Clinton investigations in the 1990s. Scaife, publisher of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, has given the Clinton Foundation between $100,001 and $250,000, but did not make a donation last year. Since its founding in 1997, more than 160,000 people have contributed to the Clinton Foundation, with more than 11,000 individuals giving for the first time last year. More than 90 percent of the foundation's donations last year were valued at $250 or less. The foundation finances charitable programs in climate change, global health, poverty and education. It also hosts the annual Clinton Global Initiative, which brings together philanthropists, corporate chiefs, government officials and nonprofit leaders to find charitable solutions to worldwide problems. The foundation said its activities have positively affected more than 220 million lives in 170 countries, including helping some 2 million people living with HIV/AIDS get access to medicines and helping 40 of the world's largest cities reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the foundation helped implement waste management projects in Delhi, launch the first-ever Zagat Guide to Harlem and provide more than 1 million meals to schoolchildren across Latin America. The foundation also financed the construction of Clinton's presidential library in Little Rock. Clinton is under no legal obligation to identify his foundation's donors. Former president George W. Bush has not revealed the donors helping construct his presidential library in Texas. Clinton resisted revealing his foundation's donors during his wife's presidential campaign, but he agreed to do so in late 2008 when Hillary Clinton was negotiating with Obama's transition team to join the Cabinet. In December 2008, Clinton for the first time released a list of donors, and has pledged to update the list annually, according to the agreement with Obama. Clinton also agreed that new donations from foreign governments would be examined by government ethics officers. "
1,"NEW YORK - Obesity increased among black and American Indian girls in California even while declining for non-Hispanic whites, signaling flaws in programs aimed at combating fatness, researchers said. The rate of obesity rose to 22 percent in 2008 for black girls, from 20 percent seven years earlier, while climbing for American Indian girls to 23 percent from 15 percent, according to a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. Those numbers moved up even after 2005, when the rate for non- Hispanic white girls fell by 0.6 percentage point, to 10 percent, the scientists said. The finding suggests there will be greater disparities among racial and ethnic groups over time, and that anti-obesity programs must be tailored to high-risk populations, said researchers led by Kristine A. Madsen, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. 'Our study is a call to action,' Madsen said in a telephone interview. 'We're the first ones to show that the policies that we're putting in place to decrease obesity are not decreasing disparities. That's scary.' Programs should target low-income communities specifically, since that is where obesity is increasing, she said. Obesity is the second-biggest lifestyle-related cause of disease and death in the United States, after smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC, based in Atlanta, classifies obesity as an epidemic, one that persists even as companies such as London-based GlaxoSmithKline offer pharmaceutical solutions and hospital networks such as HCA Inc. in Nashville, Tenn., promote obesity surgeries. The researchers examined data from the years 2001 to 2008 for 8.3 million fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-graders of both sexes, ages 8 to 17. Using data from mandatory school fitness assessments, researchers determined who was obese by calculating BMI, or body mass index, which is weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in meters. 'Normal' index numbers are 18.5 to 24.9. Doctors generally deem patients to be 'overweight' at an index figure of 25 to 29.9, and 'obese' at 30 or higher. A 5-foot, 5-inch woman is considered overweight at 150 pounds and obese at 180. A 6-foot man is overweight at 184 pounds and obese at 221. For the research, patients were classified by how their BMI numbers compared with those of other people of similar sex and age. Some 38 percent of all students included in the study were deemed overweight according to the methodology, including 20 percent who were obese and 3.6 percent considered 'severely' obese, the scientists wrote. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian girls were two to three more three times as likely to be overweight as non- Hispanic white girls, the study showed. Boys' patterns were similar, 'but with lesser disparities,' according to the report. 'In a nation that is so well resourced and has such influence in the world, race and income shouldn't predict health differences,' Madsen said. First Lady Michelle Obama began a national 'Let's Move' campaign in February aimed at 'solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight.' The study was carried out at researchers at the University of California campuses in San Francisco and Berkeley, and at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City. The authors recommended adoption of a soda tax, because sugary drinks have been linked to obesity and since consumption is known to be higher in lower-income communities, Madsen said. School environments should also include more physical education and healthier food, she said. 'We would love to see our study in the hands of policy- makers at national, state and local levels who will improve push for a soda tax and will change school policies,' Madsen said. California minors account for 13 percent of the total population under 18 years old, according to the study. The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J.; the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health Human Development in Rockville, Md.; and the American Heart Association in Dallas. 'Obesity reduction campaigns are not targeted enough at populations that are not mainstream, so the message is not specific to the culture, food, language, and exercise of American Indians and Alaska natives,' said Rick Haverkate, director of public health at the National Indian Health Board, in Washington, in a telephone interview. Among states, California has the highest number of different American Indian tribes, Haverkate said. Many live in rural areas where there isn't enough access to healthy foods and fitness equipment, he said. Low incomes also influence community members to opt for inexpensive foods that are high-calorie and high- fat, he said. Some 21 percent of American Indian and Alaska native children were obese in 2008, which is higher than any other U.S. racial or ethnic group, according to the CDC. American Indian and Alaska natives represented 1.5 percent of the national population in 2000, according to the latest relevant census data. 'There's no one fix-it solution and a whole range of tribal, governmental and personal choices have to be made,' Haverkate said. "
1,"Taliban fighters used to swagger with impunity through this farming village, threatening to assassinate government collaborators. They seeded the main thoroughfare, a dirt road with moonlike craters, with land mines. They paid local men to attack U.S. and Afghan troops. Then, beginning in late February, a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces soldiers organized nearly two dozen villagers into an armed Afghan-style neighborhood watch group. These days, the bazaar is thriving. The schoolhouse has reopened. People in the area have become confident enough to report Taliban activity to the village defense force and the police. As a consequence, insurgent attacks have nearly ceased and U.S. soldiers have not hit a single roadside bomb in the area in two months, according to the detachment. 'Everyone feels safer now,' said Nasarullah, one of two gray-bearded tribal elders in charge of the village force. 'Nobody worries about getting killed anymore.' The rapid and profound changes have generated excitement among top U.S. military officials in Afghanistan, fueling hope that such groups could reverse insurgent gains by providing the population a degree of protection that the police, the Afghan army and even international military forces have been unable to deliver. But plans to expand the program have been stymied by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who fears the teams could turn into offensive militias, the sorts of which wreaked havoc on the country in the 1990s and prompted the rise of the Taliban. 'This is playing with fire,' an Afghan government official said. 'These groups may bring us security today, but what happens tomorrow?' Citing Karzai's objections, Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, has blocked the release of money needed to broaden the initiative. He also has instructed State Department personnel in the country not to assist the effort until the Afghan government endorses it. In addition to sharing Karzai's concerns about what would happen to the local defense forces once U.S. oversight ends, Eikenberry and other embassy officials worry that the program would weaken the central government in the eyes of the public and compete with efforts to build up the nation's army and police. 'At the end of the day, how sustainable would a program like this be?' said a State Department official based in Kabul, who like other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal disputes. 'It runs counter to the goal of giving the state a monopoly of force.' The military's interest in local-defense initiatives is driven in large part by President Barack Obama's July 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing combat forces, which has increased pressure on commanders to demonstrate clear progress in their counterinsurgency mission this year. Some military officials have expressed frustration that U.S. diplomats in Kabul have not done more to lobby Karzai and other Afghan officials to change their minds. Interior Minister Hanif Atmar, who had been supportive of the initiative earlier in the year, told participants at a U.S.-Afghan planning session this month that he no longer sanctions it, a reversal that military officials attribute to pressure from Karzai. Atmar instead wants the United States to expand a different local-defense program, which is under the control of his ministry and has been implemented in one province in the east, but U.S. commanders think it will not be as effective as the approach undertaken in Afghanistan. Instead of waiting for Karzai's approval, the Special Forces command has moved forward with pilot projects here and in nine other villages, hoping to show that the forces being created are not militias. The command allowed a Washington Post reporter to visit four of the sites this month. 'There are signs of real promise,' said Brig. Gen. Austin Miller, the top special operations commander in Afghanistan. A senior U.S. military official said Karzai has provided a tacit blessing for a small number of experiments so long as the forces that are created are connected in some way to the Afghan government. The official said the Special Forces aims to build those links. In Washington, a senior administration official involved in Afghanistan policy said the experiments have prompted interest _ and cautious support _ in the White House. 'These sorts of bottom-up solutions need to be part of the equation,' the official said. _ _ _ When a detachment from the 1st Special Forces Group arrived here in mid-January, it seemed like a good place to experiment with the Local Defense Initiative. This part of the fertile Arghandab valley is a key route for insurgents seeking to infiltrate the city of Kandahar, located less than 20 miles away. The population here is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns who belong to the Alokozai tribe. Their leadership has been generally supportive of the Afghan government. But when the soldiers asked the principal tribal leaders in the area to gather to discuss security matters, they were rebuffed. 'The only thing they could agree on was saying to us, `We don't need your help,' ' the detachment commander said. U.S. military officials requested that members of the unit, as well as the name of the village, not be identified because of operational security concerns. The soldiers responded by setting out to drink endless cups of tea with the elders. Instead of driving around in large land-mine-resistant vehicles as conventional U.S. Army units do, the soldiers jumped on camouflage-painted dirt bikes and four-wheel all-terrain vehicles equipped with a front mount for an M240 machine gun and a rear rack upon which a few AT-4 small rockets can be lashed. Their mode of transportation mirrored that of their Special Forces brethren riding horseback with troops of the Northern Alliance in 2001. The goal was to win support for a program that was hatched at a Pentagon City, Va., sports bar last year by Special Forces Lt. Col. David Mann and Seth Jones, a Rand Corp. political scientist who focuses on Afghanistan. They questioned whether the United States and NATO were missing an opportunity by concentrating so many resources on building up the national police, the army and other formal institutions, arguing that the Afghans should try to re-create the informal village-level defense forces that existed in parts of the country when it was a monarchy. Mann and Jones's plan, which senior U.S. commanders endorsed, seeks to allay fears that the effort will breed militias: The forces are not paid or given weapons, and to minimize the risk of warlordism, they are supposed to be under the authority of a group of tribal elders _ not just one person. Within a month, the promise of modest reconstruction projects paid for with the military's discretionary money managed to sway the locals. Nasarullah, who is the Alokozai leader in the village, agreed to sit down with Mohammed Aman, the leader of the minority Kakar tribesmen in the area. A few weeks later, the 22-member force was formed, drawn principally from the Alokozai but with the support of the Kakar. The detachment has trained the members in rifle marksmanship, basic first aid and how to conduct a patrol. They also have received lessons on setting up traffic checkpoints and searching vehicles. Those selected were eager to participate but they initially insisted on being paid for their work _ a line the Special Forces did not want to cross. After extensive negotiations, they compromised: Members of the defense force would receive $10 a day, but they would have to spend part of their time working on reconstruction projects. 'They're pulling security and laying bricks,' the commander said. _ _ _ The defense force appears more ragtag than fearsome militia. Although the members wear matching army-green shalwar kameez and camouflage vests, they have all manner of footwear and headdress. Their AK-47s are battered, and they show more interest in lolling about their compound than imposing authority on the village. But that does not seem to trouble the soldiers here. The measure of their effectiveness, say members of the detachment, has more to do with perceptions of security among the villagers than the amount of time the force struts around. 'They're a tripwire,' Mann said. 'The fact that they're guaranteeing safety is the essence of the program.' To the soldiers here, the clearest measure of the change that has occurred may not be in statistics or comments from residents, but in a one-page handwritten letter, placed in an air-mail envelope and dropped under the gate of the local defense force compound last week. It was addressed to Toorjan, the commander of one of the two police checkpoints on the main dirt road _ the only Afghan government presence in the area. In January, he hit a roadside bomb while driving through the bazaar. He was not seriously injured, but his truck was destroyed. The letter, from a person who said he was a local supporter of the Taliban, was an olive branch of sorts. The writer blamed the bombing, which he said he witnessed, on fighters from Pakistan, and he suggested he was open to switching sides. 'The local Taliban are our neighbors,' Toorjan said. 'Now that the security is better, they have no other choice but to support us.' _ _ _ Even if the Special Forces get the authority and funding to expand the initiative, replicating what has unfolded here will not be easy. It has taken three months of intense effort by one detachment to turn around _ for the moment _ just one village. Although there are several dozen detachments in Afghanistan, not all of them could be reassigned to this task. And even if a few dozen villages were flipped, it may not have the hoped-for strategic impact. Among members of the village defense force here, however, questions of growth are less important than what happens once the flow of U.S. cash ends. Will the group demobilize? Or will it, like so many other armed outfits in Afghanistan's history, morph into something larger and more troublesome? Nasarullah, the local elder, insists that he does not have the money, or the desire, to sustain the effort himself. Even the members do not regard their current roles as a permanent occupation. Some said they would like to join the police. Others said they will go back to their farms. 'I am only doing this for my village,' said Zahir Jan, who owns a small shop in Kandahar that he has entrusted to his brother while he serves in the defense force. 'I am looking forward to the day I can put my gun down. But that day has not arrived.' "
1,"If you're a woman and just turned 40, there's a rite of passage: your first mammogram. You are asked to place your breasts, one at a time, between two pieces of clear plastic. A kindly, often smiling technologist turns a dial that squeezes and slightly flattens the breast, necessary to get a good image. Before the digital image is taken, patients are given a gentle reminder: 'Don't breathe' _ to which women sometimes want to mutter, 'As if.' This first, or baseline, mammogram at age 40 has been considered part of a long- term strategy for detecting breast cancer in its earliest stages, when it is the most treatable. It was one piece of health advice that most women remember, considered near- gospel. That is until last year when it was challenged by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory panel. Rather than have women start getting mammograms in their 40s, the task force suggested that most could wait until their 50s. And even then, it said, women between the ages of 50 and 74 should be tested once every two years rather than annually. The guidelines were based in part on the number false-positive tests, when women appeared to have a cancerous lump that further testing showed was benign. These false positives could occur nearly twice as often among women between the ages of 40 and 69 who received mammograms every year rather than every other year, the report said. In short, having mammograms every other year provides a better balance of benefits, it added, including fewer unnecessary biopsies. The task force wasn't alone in this stance. The University of California at Berkeley took a similar position in its February Wellness Letter. However, it urged patients, particularly those with a family history of breast cancer, to talk to their doctor about the issue. The recommendations have triggered a fierce and sometimes emotional national debate over what advice women should follow. 'Women are really confused and scared,' said Dr. Lisa Ivanjack, an internal medicine physician at The Everett Clinic in Everett, Wash. 'My mother-in-law died of breast cancer. It's a scary personal issue. It's hard for patients constantly to be told different things.' She said she advises patients to stay the course and continue with previous guidelines. 'It's been shown that women getting screened between 39 and 49 help reduce breast cancer mortality rates,' she said. Shauna McBride, a spokeswoman who works at the American Cancer Society's Seattle office, said mammograms are the best tool now available for detecting beast cancer. Women in their 40s who decide not to be screened, while eliminating the possibility of false positive tests, 'wouldn't benefit from the proven, life- savings benefits of mammography,' McBride said. Nationally, approximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths occur in women who were diagnosed in their 40s, and 22 percent occurred in women diagnosed in their 50s, she said. Some women coming to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett for their mammograms have asked about the new recommendations. 'Some had friends in their 40s who had breast cancer,' said Mary Wickert, a technologist who administers mammograms at the hospital's Comprehensive Breast Center. 'They can't understand why the recommendations were what they were.' The anxiety over mammograms that show a spot of concern, triggering biopsies that later turn out negative, were other reasons the national task force gave for going to every-other-year mammograms. Dr. Tom Smith, a surgeon and the breast center's medical director, disagrees. Getting annual mammograms helps detect cancer at its earliest stages, cancers as small as 1/8 to of an inch. Some microscopic cancers can be detected by a few small calcifications spotted on a mammogram, he said. 'The benefits are clearly there with screening and with modern mammography.' Mammograms cost about $150 while the cost of treating cancer can be $6,000 for surgery, about $12,000 for radiation, and an initial treatment of chemotherapy can cost about $14,000, even in relatively straight forward cases. 'I think for me it's a compelling argument that discovering early breast cancer can save some of this,' he said. 'It's an interesting argument that was left out: What it costs to discover breast cancer in that early age group.' The American Cancer Society statement on mammograms: 'Despite recent controversies over its usefulness, especially in women under age 50, mammography is still considered to be the gold standard for early detection of breast cancer. Women are still advised to get a mammogram every year, starting at age 40.' The University of California at Berkeley Wellness Letter: 'For most women, it would make sense to switch from annual screening to every two years. The evidence shows that mammography every two years saves nearly as many lives as annual screening.' "
1,"The leader of a Mexican farmworkers' organization and 14 other people were killed in a mass shooting in the northern Mexico state of Sonora, an official said Saturday. Sonora prosecutors' spokesman Jose Larrinaga said the victims include farm leader Margarito Montes, 10 other men, one woman and three minors. Most were believed to be Montes' relatives or employees. Larrinaga said the victims' bullet-ridden bodies were found on a roadside near a farm Friday. The killers apparently used assault rifles, the sort of weapon favored by Mexico's drug gangs, but Larrinaga said the motive in the attack was still under investigation. The killings occurred in a rural area of the state, near the border with Sinaloa, the home state of some the country's most powerful drug lords. Montes was the leader of the General Popular Union of Workers and Farmers, which claims tens of thousands of members, mostly in southern Mexico. Local news media reported that Montes had led peasant and squatters' movements involved in land seizures and that his group has sometimes had violent clashes with rival claimants to land. Montes' group is an affiliate of the nationwide Permanent Agrarian Congress, which said Montes was ambushed by a gang of gunmen near his home. It issued a statement calling his killing 'a cowardly assassination,' and suggested it could have been related to land disputes. The group said it 'regrets .... that in the 21st-century, land disputes are still being settled with gunfire' and demanded authorities catch and punish the killers. In the southern state of Guerrero on Saturday, state police reported assailants tossed two grenades at a police guard station at a toll booth in the resort of Acapulco. Assailants also fired assault rifles and tossed two grenades at a police station in the nearby town of Tecpan de Galeana. Some damage but no injuries were reported in the attacks. State police also reported finding nine banners strung up in towns along the coast near Acapulco with messages relating to organized crime gangs. The police statement did not provide the text of the messages, but drug cartels frequently use such banners to threaten rivals or claim credit for killings. The attacks came at the start of what is expected to be a busy three-day weekend for the resort, with tourists taking advantage of Mexico's Day of the Dead holiday. "
1,"BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward faces rising speculation that the worsening oil spill will cost him his job as he grapples with worried investors, rating downgrades, politicians and public anger over the company's inability to control the crisis. Hayward will address London's investors and analysts Friday, spokesman Mark Salt said by phone. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings downgraded BP Thursday because the costs from the accident will hurt finances. Two senators said Wednesday it would be 'unfathomable' for BP to pay a dividend. Criticism of Hayward grew this week after BP's failure to stem the flow from the damaged well caused the biggest share price drop in 18 years and raised the risk the London-based company may become a takeover target. Wednesday, he apologized for comments last week that he wanted his 'life back.' 'The pressure is on Hayward at the moment, primarily from politicians,' said David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the National Association of Pension Funds in London. 'Investors clearly will want some answers in order to understand what the long-term future for the company is.' More than $59 billion has been wiped off the value of BP since the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon rig. Credit Suisse said Wednesday the disaster may cost BP as much as $37 billion, almost double this year's likely profit, risking a cut in dividends. 'There is a question mark over the chief executive officer,' said Colin McLean, of SVM Asset Management in Edinburgh, which holds BP shares. 'The dividend will continue but be cut. A quarter or a third is quite possible.' Irish bookmaker Paddy Power offered even odds that Hayward will leave his post by the end of year. The New York Daily News Wednesday called him 'the most hated -- and clueless -- man in America' for his handling of the crisis. 'It looks increasingly likely that heads will roll, and Tony will be in the frame,' Dougie Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities in London, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. 'The longer these things go on, the shakier things look for the company.' Hayward, whose call Friday will be relayed on BP's website, has come under fire from lawmakers after BP initially underestimated the size of the leak, starting with 1,000 barrels a day and then raising it to 5,000 barrels a day. U.S. Geological Survey and science adviser Marcia McNutt said last week that the well may have been gushing 19,000 barrels a day. BP sheared away the riser from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well Thursday, a precursor to the company's attempt to lower a cap onto the leak and divert oil to ships on the surface. An attempt to plug the well with mud and debris failed last weekend. That means that the flow of oil from the well probably won't be stopped until August, when the drilling of relief wells is scheduled for completion. Hayward apologized Wednesday for what he called 'hurtful' comments saying that he wanted the spill to end in order to get 'his life back.' That followed comments in which he said that the environmental impact of the spill would be 'very, very modest' and that the amount of oil and dispersant is tiny compared to the size of the Gulf. Hayward spent much of his first three years as CEO working to improve BP's safety record after a series of accidents, including the deadly March 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that helped bring down his predecessor, John Browne. 'Safety has been a major plank of Hayward's tenure,' the National Association of Pension Funds' Paterson said. Unlike Browne, Hayward didn't attend Oxford or Cambridge, Britain's most elite universities. The 53-year-old was born in Slough, England, 25 miles west of London and studied in Birmingham and then in Edinburgh, where he earned a PhD in geology in 1982. He joined BP the same year to work in the North Sea and worked in Asia, South America and the U.S. before becoming CEO in 2007. 'Hayward only just got his feet under the table and is highly regarded within the company,' said Peter Hitchens, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London. 'I don't think Hayward will step down, but you can never rule these things out. BP is starting to be seen as a walking catastrophe.' With assistance from Eduard Gismatullin, Stanley Reed, Kari Lundgren and Andrea Catherwood in London. "
1,"After earning an Olympic title in the choppy, sloppy 1,000-meter speedskating race, Christine Nesbitt goes for gold No. 2 on Sunday in the 1,500. 'I feel relieved after the 1,000,' Nesbitt said of Thursday's race. 'Probably the worst 1,000 I have done this year. 'Now I can enjoy the 1,500.' After winning Canada's first speedskating gold at the oval by .02 seconds over Annette Gerritsen of the Netherlands, she no longer has to carry the weight of a whole nation's expectations on Sunday. 'I know I have to skate more relaxed,' Nesbitt said after Saturday's training session. This time, though, she will have more than the home fans to help her out. Kristina Groves is currently leading the World Cup standings and the two Canadians have exchanged 1-2 finishes over the last two races. 'All eyes are on Kristina and I am OK with that,' Nesbitt said. Groves, who won silver over the distance at the 2006 Turin Games, has also been able to ease the pressure after winning bronze in the opening 3,000. With the men yet to break into the medals, Canada must rely heavily on its strong women's team. More than halfway through the Olympic speedskating competition, the Canadians are in fourth position behind the surprising South Koreans, the Netherlands and the United States. Nesbitt and Groves are also key members for the team pursuit, where they are favorites to win gold, too. The Dutch, though, are expected to be close on their heels in the 1,500, but this time it is unlikely Gerritsen will be chasing the Canadians hardest. Gerritsen is primarily known as a sprinter, and will likely yield top Dutch honors to Ireen Wust, the surprise winner of the 3,000 in Turin. She was a disappointing seventh this time around, and will be looking for revenge over a distance where she is third in the World Cup standings. In Sunday's race, Nesbitt will go in the final pairing with American Jennifer Rodriguez, knowing what time she will have to beat. Groves goes one pair ahead of her against Poland's Katarzyna Bachleda-Curus. In the 15th of 19 pairs, Wust should set the pace for the other favorites to shoot at. Martina Sablikova, who won the 3,000 during the opening weekend, is also entered into Sunday's race but is not expected to challenge for gold on the heavy ice. The second gold for the Czech skater should come in next week's 5,000. "
1,"Shell Oil announced Wednesday that it has scaled back its Arctic Ocean exploration plans in 2011 to promising sites in the Beaufort Sea, backing off prospects in the Chukchi Sea until legal clouds are cleared. 'Our plan is to drill in the Beaufort in 2011,' said Shell Alaska Vice President Pete Slaiby. The company has applied for one exploration well in the Beaufort off Alaska's north coast and will seek a permit for a second. The company will hold off applying for well permits in the Chukchi of Alaska's northwest coast until two court cases are resolved. Shell's plans to drill exploration wells in the both areas this year were put on hold by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Salazar suspended applications for permits, and has set no timetable for lifting the suspension. Drilling in Arctic waters is bitterly opposed by environmental groups and some Alaska Native groups, who say petroleum companies have not demonstrated an ability to clean up a spill in ice-choked waters. They also say the remote location of drilling sites, the area's notorious inclement weather and the lack of infrastructure, including a deep-water port, would make a cleanup of a major spill nearly impossible. Shell has invested more than $3.5 billion in the Arctic outer continental shelf, including $2.2 billion in leases in the Chukchi that have been challenged. Slaiby said Shell will need a decision by December to move forward with its 2011 plans, which involve moving north a drilling ship and a small fleet of support vessels, including spill response boats. Shell has continuously stressed that Arctic drilling would be in shallow water and that the risk of a spill is minimal. Slaiby said the company since the Deepwater Horizon blowout has taken 'extraordinary steps to build confidence around our 2011 program.' The company also will position a second drilling ship in Alaska as an additional safety measure. If the first drilling ship were crippled by a blowout, a second ship could drill a relief well. 'We also confirmed our commitment to engineer an oil spill containment system, which is designed to capture hydrocarbons at the source in the unlikely event of a shallow water blowout,' Slaiby said. Some of Shell's Chukchi prospects are 140 miles offshore, but Slaiby said the distance did not contribute to the decision not to seek permits there for the 2011 drilling season. Rather, it was a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., that found flaws in the federal government's 5-year leasing plan, and a second lawsuit filed in Anchorage that ruled the former Minerals Management Service had not required adequate environmental reviews for the Chukchi leases. Slaiby said Shell is optimistic they will be resolved. 'All of these issues that we've got, legally, in the Chukchi, I think are fairly small and narrow,' he said. "
1,"Russia's defense minister says that along with France's offer to sell an advanced naval ship, Moscow is considering similar proposals from Spain and Netherlands. Anatoly Serdyukov was quoted by the Russian news agencies Interfax and RIA Novosti as saying Monday that Russia wants to buy one such ship and jointly build three others. Such an arms sale would be the biggest ever by a NATO country to Russia. Earlier this year, France said it agreed to sell Russia a single Mistral-class assault ship and was considering a request for three more vessels that may be built under license in Russian shipyards. Serdyukov's statement appeared to indicate that Moscow wants to make the best possible deal by sending a warning to Paris that it was also talking to other potential suppliers. "
1,"Finland has banned selling or giving cigarettes to people under the age of 18 as part of extensive legislation that aims to make the Nordic country smoke-free by 2040. The new law says that anyone caught providing youth with tobacco products faces fines and a maximum six-month sentence. It came into force on Friday. The legislation also allows housing associations to ban smoking near children's play areas and on apartment balconies. Finland banned smoking in workplaces, public buildings and on public transport in 1995. In 2012, it will push cigarette retailing under the counter -- out of sight of underage customers, and three years later cigarette vending machines will be scrapped. "
1,"Paul R. Jones, who built one of the largest collections of 20th century African-American art, has died in Atlanta. He was 81. University of Alabama spokeswoman Angie Estes says Jones died Tuesday after a brief illness. The Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art is at the university. The school received 1,700 paintings and photographs valued at $5 million in 2008. Jones began collecting art in the 1960s and was soon drawn to African-American pieces after noticing the art was vastly underrepresented in public galleries. He also donated some 900 works to the University of Delaware. Besides being an art collector, Jones was a civil rights activist. He was a native of Alabama and had lived in Atlanta, Georgia, for several decades. "
1,"Frank Magid, the television 'news doctor' whose survey research and advice to local television stations in the 1970s resulted in co-anchors who chatted between stories, fast-paced graphics, sports tickers and live shots, and a heavy reliance on both crime coverage and feel-good segments, died of lymphoma Feb. 5 in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 78. 'Action News,' as Magid dubbed his format, revolutionized broadcast news operations from Cedar Rapids to Kuala Lumpur. At a time when most local TV news shows featured a single anchorman reading the news from a sheet of paper in front of a static background, 'Action News' and its rival, 'Eyewitness News,' demonstrated both the untapped possibilities of the medium and the opportunity to devolve into 'happy talk' between serious segments. The redone broadcasts almost always shot to the top of the ratings. But Magid-style changes were criticized as both a uniformization and a dumbing- down of news coverage. 'Thanks to him, local newscasts throughout America are like airports or fast food joints; they lack all traces of indigenousness,' wrote Tom Shales of The Washington Post in 1982. Supporters noted that Magid consistently emphasized the importance of local news, sharpened his clients' newswriting and forced them to pay better attention to the impressions of the audience. His research said viewers wanted hard news mixed with health, consumer and lifestyle stories, presented in a highly visual, fast-paced broadcast by people whom viewers liked. Shorter stories, urgent tones and better dressed and coiffed news staffers were just part of the bargain. The 'Action News' format had its first major success in 1970, when WPVI in Philadelphia rocketed from last to first place in the ratings. Station managers took notice, and it quickly became standard fare across the country and later, around the world. Magid's research also recommended CBS News feature Walter Cronkite as the solo anchorman on its evening news program. That didn't stop the venerable broadcaster from describing the work of consultants such as Magid as 'a fad' and 'balderdash,' in a widely reported 1976 speech, dubbing those who followed his advice 'suckers for a fad' and 'editing by consultancy.' The criticism irked Magid. He told Washington Post reporter John Carmody the next year that 'I feel sorry for Walter because he doesn't take time to check the facts. It's interesting that TV newsmen are so gullible.' Magid also helped develop ABC's 'Good Morning America,' which in 1975 defined the modern morning show format, and he developed local early morning local newscasts as well. 'We were the first to suggest to clients that there was an opportunity for news between 6 and 7 a.m. in the morning and strongly urged our clients to do that,' Magid in 1997 told Electronic Media magazine, which called him 'the godfather of local TV news research.' Clients resisted his suggestion, he recalled, claiming that the time was not covered by ratings, the audience was too small and advertisers would never support the concept. A New Orleans stations, followed by Sacramento and Minneapolis, proved the naysayers wrong. Magid (pronounced Mah-gid with a hard G), through his eponymous company based for many years in Marion, Iowa, also ran a 'star school' for aspiring anchors where reporters were taught 'relaxed intensity' in their presentation. Magid Associates also served as an industry recruitment agency, providing client stations who were searching for new 'talent' with videotapes of up-and-coming broadcasters in other markets. Frank Newton Magid was born in Chicago on Sept. 1, 1931, and served in the Army during the Korean War. He graduated from the University of Iowa and received a master's degree there in 1956 in the fields of social psychology and statistics. After teaching at Iowa's Coe College and the University of Iowa, Magid launched his company in 1956. His first client was a bank; his fourth was WMT-TV, now KGAN-TV, in Cedar Rapids. By creating careful surveys and polling random samples of a population, Magid and his employees were able to provide highly accurate data that gave television its first serious consumer research. The work paid off for the Iowa station, and the station's manager recommended Magid for a job at Time-Life's newly acquired KOGO-TV in San Diego. That, too, was successful, and it led to a contract for all the Time-Life stations. 'And that really was our launching pad because they were very kind to us and began to do some considerable amount of advertising to the trades, talking about how they were listening to the public through this rather new, and at that time quite unique, kind of research,' Magid told Electronic Media. His firm, from which he retired in 2002, also advised AM radio stations to get into the FM field, and urged broadcasters to invested in cable TV. He helped identify viability of direct broadcast satellite television and did the first research that determined the viability of digital video recorders. Now based in Minneapolis, the privately-held company has about 200 employees and advises all kinds of media, including The Washington Post, through its MORI Research division. Survivors include his wife of 53 years, Marilyn Magid of Santa Barbara; two sons, Brent Magid who took over the company and resides in Minneapolis, and Creighton Magid of Washington; a brother; and four grandchildren.

1,The United States beat Russia 4-3 on Sunday for its first victory in the Junior World Cup hockey tournament. Both teams had lost all their games in the preliminary rounds but battled for their first points in Pool I to determine the final rankings of teams finishing between 17th and 20th. Belgium edged England 2-0 in another match in Malaysia's Johor Baru city with both goals scored in the first half. 
1,"The first feature film by Jim Loach looks at the true story of the deportation of thousands of children from Britain to Australia and the abuse they suffered. The director said he sees it as a tale of survival and the indomitable human spirit. Loach, English director Ken Loach's son, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he was fascinated by the woman who uncovered the scandal and is at the center of the movie: a social worker who worked doggedly to reunite families and bring authorities to account. He became fascinated by the personalities of the former child migrants, some of whom he met, and questions of identity. Ultimately, he felt the story needed to be told. 'The story itself was shocking and appalling and amazing,' Loach said at the Rome film festival, where 'Oranges and Sunshine' was presented. 'We couldn't believe that it had happened and we were amazed that so little had been said about it.' Under the program, between 1920 to 1960s, an estimated 150,000 British children were sent to Australia and other distant colonies. The program was intended to ease pressure on British social services and provide the children with a fresh start ('oranges and sunshine'), but many of them ended up in institutions where they were physically and sexually abused, or were sent to work as farm laborers. Both Australia and Britain have apologized recently for the child migrant program. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said this year that he sorry for the 'shameful' and 'misguided' program. In Australia, Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called the caretakers in Australia 'a ring of pedophiles' as he apologized last year for his country's role in the scheme. In the movie, the story is told through the eyes of social worker Margaret Humphreys, played my Emily Watson, the Oscar-nominated British actress. Humphreys almost stumbles across the story. On one night in Nottingham, she is approached by a woman who says she was put on a boat to Australia when she was a little girl in a children's home. She wants to find her true identity. From that moment on, Humphreys discovers hundreds of cases, hearing about the horrific abuse and hardship the children, now adults, lived through. She travels to Australia and confronts authorities, at the detriment of her own personal life and health. 'She was battling to overcome the odds,' said Loach. 'For us it was a survivor's story. It was about the human spirit.' Watson told reporters in Rome this week that, as she was reading the script, she became 'emotionally involved by the end of page 2.' Loach met with Humphreys, who's written a book about the case, and with several former child migrants. As he heard about their 'utterly compelling and shocking' stories, he started combining different aspects of their personalities to form the characters in the movie. He said his father has watched 'Oranges and Sunshine' and liked it. He also helped with the script and in the cutting room. Speaking of his father's influence, Loach said that growing up he was always encouraged to have an inquisitive mind and search out stories, especially ones 'that were inherently contradictory and dramatic and important to be told.'

1,"Pakistan has been bowled out for 296 on the fourth day of the second test on Monday, setting England a target of 118 for victory. Pakistan added just five runs to its overnight score when Mohammad Asif (11) was caught by Kevin Pietersen off Stuart Broad (2-66) from the 11th ball of the morning session at Edgbaston. Graeme Swann was England's leading bowler with 6-65, while Zulqarnain Haider was Pakistan's top scorer with 88. "
1,"Giorgos Karagounis converted a penalty and set up another goal to lead Panathinaikos Athens to a 2-0 win over crosstown AEK Sunday and earn a berth in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Ante Rukavina also scored for Panathinaikos. Panathinaikos finished at the top of the four-team Greek league playoffs for European competitions, ahead of AEK, which secured a place in the playoff round of the Europa League. PAOK, which finished third, will play in the third qualifying round of the Europa League and last-placed Larissa in the second. The game marked the end of the Greek soccer season, with Olympiakos winning both the title and the Greek Cup. The Greek champion will join Panathinaikos in the 3rd qualifying round of the Champions League. AEK charged forward from the kickoff squandering two early scoring chances. A powerful shot by Nacho Scocco in the ninth minute forced Mario Galinovic to punch the ball clear, and a minute later a shot by Ismael Blanco hit Panathinaikos' post. But in the 31st minute, Karagounis put Panathinaikos ahead with a penalty, five minutes before supplying the pass to Rukavina to make the score 2-0. Galinovic made a flying save to keep out a powerful shot by Dimitris Koutroumanos in the second half and AEK's goalkeeper Sebastian Saja made a fingertip save following a shot by Dimitris Salpingidis.

1,"BERLIN - More than 20,000 art objects seized by the Nazis from Jewish collectors and institutions in France are now searchable online in a database that the creators hope will ease the path for families seeking stolen heirlooms. About half of the listed art works haven't yet been returned to the original owners or their heirs, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which together with the United States Holocaust Museum is the organizer of the project. As an example, a search on Rembrandt revealed that 10 works still hadn't been restituted. The database provides access to the Nazis' detailed records and photographs of the objects plundered in occupied France by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (E.R.R.), a task force authorized by Adolf Hitler to loot art across Europe. The E.R.R. set up in France soon after the invasion and sorted its booty at the Jeu de Paume in Paris, from where it shipped the best to Germany and sold less highly esteemed works. 'Families robbed of their prized art works can now search this list to help them locate long-lost treasures,' Julius Berman, the chairman of the Claims Conference, said in an e- mailed statement. 'Organizing Nazi art-looting records is an important step in righting a historical wrong.' The Claims Conference urged museums and dealers to use the database to check their holdings for unreturned looted objects. Users can search for items by artist, owner, inventory number and medium, or they can browse through the 260 collections, mostly belonging to Jewish families. Items range from abstract art to 18th-century furniture, from medieval crucifixes to African masks. Works by Pablo Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh, Lucas Cranach and Johannes Vermeer are among those seized. 'There is a story, a complex human drama behind all the names in this database,' said Project Director Marc Masurovsky, a consultant to the Holocaust Memorial Museum. 'It can benefit the art world, and also gives insight into the aesthetics and tastes of the time,' he said. 'I hope it will demystify the issue of looting and give as accurate an account as possible of the journey these works took.' "
1,"The presidential candidate of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which governs the semi-autonomous region of Southern Sudan, said he's withdrawing from next month's election, the first multiparty vote in 24 years. Yasser Arman cited 'many violations' in preparations for the presidential vote, especially in the western region of Darfur, where government forces and insurgents have battled for the past seven years. 'The security conditions do not allow for free and fair elections to be held in Darfur,' Arman told reporters in the capital of Khartoum. 'Therefore I will not participate in the presidential elections.' While the SPLM as a party will run in the elections across the rest of Sudan, it is withdrawing its candidates in Darfur, he said. The April 11-13 vote for the presidency, parliament and state governorships will take place five years after the SPLM signed a peace deal with the government, ending a 20-year civil war between the Muslim north and the south, where Christianity and traditional religion dominate. Southern Sudan will vote in a referendum in January to decide whether to secede from the rest of Sudan, sub- Saharan Africa's third-biggest oil producer. A coalition of opposition parties in northern Sudan on Wednesday postponed a decision on whether to boycott the vote. It accuses the government of rigging the election and says the National Elections Commission is biased in favor of Umar al-Bashir's National Congress Party. The International Crisis Group also accused Bashir's government of rigging the election. The government has 'manipulated the 2008 census, drafted the election laws in its favor, gerrymandered electoral districts, co-opted traditional leaders and bought tribal loyalties,' Brussels-based ICG, a private nonprofit group that works to prevent conflict, said Tuesday in a report. 'The legal environment for free and fair elections does not exist,' Fouad Hikmat, Crisis Group's special adviser on Sudan, said in the report. 'The international community should acknowledge that whoever wins will lack legitimacy.' The government rejected the charges. 'These accusations are not true and have no basis,' Rabie Abel Ati, adviser to the minister of information, said Tuesday by phone from Khartoum. 'The registered voters will come and vote in front of international observers and in front of everyone to see.' The U.S., Britain and Norway on Wednesday called on Sudan's government and political parties to address allegations of intimidation, harassment and other safety concerns to clear the way for the vote. 'We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April,' the countries said in an e-mailed statement. While rigging has occurred across Sudan, Crisis Group said, the focus has been on Darfur, where as many as 300,000 people have died, mainly of disease and starvation, and almost 10 times that number have been displaced by the conflict, according to United Nations estimates. The government puts the death toll at about 10,000. 'Winning big in Darfur is central to the NCP's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance,' according to the Crisis Group report. Bashir, who has ruled Sudan since coming to power in a military coup in 1989, has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges he was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. Crisis Group called on international observers, such as the Atlanta-based center founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, the European Union and the African Union, to document 'the severely flawed process.'

1,"A real inspector would have focused on the powdered substance hiding in my bra, the box cutter tucked into my tights and the plastic-explosive material snuggling inside my dress pocket. But because I was too close to the subject under scrutiny, I fixated on the position of my bellybutton: How strange that it sits so high up on my torso. Get over yourself, honey: The full-body scanning machines at airport security checkpoints weren't created to point out corporeal flaws but to detect suspicious objects lurking beneath airline passengers' clothing. The advanced imaging technology identifies forms that aren't traditionally part of the human physique, such as an oval mound on the hip that could be a potential bomb, or a pen shape near the ankle that might be a knife. Since I hadn't harbored any contraband in my navel, there was no cause for alarm. Yet in a broader context, plenty of people are alarmed. The machines have sparked an electric storm of controversy that touches on such knotty issues as the U.S. government's anti-terrorist strategies and an individual's privacy rights. Compared with body scanning, removing our shoes is as benign as trying on footwear at Payless. To understand the debate from all angles, I decided to undergo a scan, experiencing technology's prying eyes firsthand. Standing before a bank of uncovered windows in a second-floor office in Rosslyn, Va., I bared almost all. If you've ever walked into a boothlike apparatus, stepped on colored footprints and moved your arms like a clumsy cheerleader, you've been body-scanned. The Transportation Security Administration piloted the new technology in 2007 and rolled out 40 of the machines in 19 airports. Last fall, the agency bought 150 imaging machines, and it has since procured funding for 300 more. If all goes according to plan, the TSA will have installed 490 scanners by year's end. 'This enables the officers to identify without any physical contact something concealed under clothing,' said Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman. 'We need to have as many different layers of security as we can. When we put them all together, it's more formidable.' The au courant technology addresses a gap in security that garnered critical attention after the failed bombing of a Christmas Day flight to Detroit. X-ray machines catch only metal objects, and explosives trace detectors, such as the sneezelike puffers, collect only the residue of hazardous material. With pat- downs, searchers can detect foreign objects stashed on a person's figure, but private areas, such as the underwear zone of the recent terrorist, are off- limits. 'Unless it's a grope, we never would have found that device,' said Brian Jenkins, a homeland security expert and senior adviser to the president of Rand Corp. 'We can increase the restrictions, or we can deploy another array of hardware.' For now, the TSA has chosen the latter, adding another machine to its already gadget-laden process. 'Since Americans are enamored with technology, we tend to look for a silver bullet,' Jenkins said. 'Will the body scanner add to the security? Yes. Will it solve the problem and prevent all future terrorist attacks? No.' The TSA has approved two types of imaging machines that utilize different technologies but share the same purpose: peeling back a passenger's clothing to reveal suspect objects on the body. With the millimeter-wave model, radio waves bounce off the skin, lighting on foreign substances; the emission is equal to one ten-thousandth of the energy released by a cellphone. The backscatter uses low-level X-rays _ about what you'd be exposed to during a two-minute plane ride _ that seek out energy discrepancies. While the passenger is being scanned, a security official in a remote location studies the captured image for strange shapes and anomalies. The whole procedure takes 15 seconds or less. The millimeter wave transmits a black-and-white 2-D hologram that resembles an overexposed photo of an X-Man gone soft. The backscatter image looks like a body sketch by an amateur artist, unrefined and not worth hanging on the fridge door. 'It's not pornographic; it's not titillating,' said Jenkins. 'I would regard these as the most unerotic images.' Unless you have a hankering for panty lines. Only six airports operate body scanners for primary screening, so unless you depart from one of those locations (such as Miami or San Francisco) or are selected for a secondary inspection, your chances of being scanned are fairly random. Rather than leave it to fate, I arranged an imaging session with Smiths Detection, an engineering firm that designs equipment for the TSA, including a millimeter-wave machine about to be field-tested. (Note: A few weeks later, I requested a scan at the Atlanta airport. Though a TSA official told me that it wasn't 'some amusement park ride,' he directed me to a machine near lanes 1 through 4. The screeners there thought I was strange but apparently not dangerous, as I received an 'all clear; copy that.') In its Rosslyn office the company keeps an array of Security `R' Us toys, some of which looked familiar (X-ray machine), others foreign (a bottle scanner that ascertains the safety of liquids) and one reminiscent of my old Dustbuster (a portable explosives trace detector). The body scanner stood against an unadorned wall opposite a wall of windows. A pair of white footprints faced a tall detection panel as exciting as a clean blackboard. A small computer screen sat on a table within view of the feet. Shannon Town, a Smiths Detection office manager, agreed to go first. As she raised her arms and spun with comfort and ease, I sensed that she was a frequent guinea pig. In fact, Town is such a veteran model that she was able to slip some 'weaponry' under her clothes without attracting notice. Only after studying her image did I detect the smuggled box cutter and explosives stand-in material. 'We are looking at differences in shapes, sizes and densities,' explained vice president Brook Miller. 'You see what you need to see.' Truth be told, I didn't think I needed to see (begin ital) this (end ital)much of Town: her bra straps, the buttons of her pants, her wiggling toes. 'It's better for females than males,' said a male volunteer, who also pranced before the machine with a fake gun tucked into his waistband. 'It looks like what you wear at the beach.' But only if your bathing suit style tends toward Germans on holiday. Body scanners may appeal to the nudists of the world, but a number of (clothed) groups are not so supportive of the technology, viewing it as a threat to an individual's right to privacy. In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union testified before Congress, questioning the equipment's ability to foil terrorists and raising concerns about potential violations of basic rights. More recently, the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, requesting the images generated by these machines. 'Before the new technology is implemented, there should be evidence of its effectiveness against the threat. The device does not locate well-concealed items in body parts and cavities,' said Michael German, policy counsel at the ACLU, citing as one example a British study that found the scanners inept at detecting low-density materials. 'It's asking a lot of people to sacrifice their privacy for technology that's not effective.' Though many folks may be ashamed of outing their beer paunches, privacy advocates also worry that the machines could violate a person's religious beliefs or cultural customs, or may unnecessarily expose a physical disfigurement or medical condition, such as a colostomy bag. 'With the current threat, this isn't the answer,' German said. 'There are other technologies that don't have these privacy issues.' To address those concerns, the TSA has implemented a number of safeguards. Faces on the images are blurred or covered with a bar, and hair is absent, creating an extended family of look-alike baldies. The Smiths Detection model gender-proofs the review process by matching female inspectors with female passengers and male inspectors with male passengers. Screeners surveying the images are physically separated from the person being scanned, minimizing the risk of an awkward encounter. L-3 Communications, which makes the millimeter-wave scanner, is taking it further: With its new automated version (in use at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport), machine replaces man, highlighting questionable objects on a Gumby-like figure. In addition, the images cannot be saved or stored; the next scan can take place only if the previous picture is erased. Finally, travelers may opt out of the experience and request another type of screening. Note: Plan B could be a pat-down. If a recent poll by USA Today and Gallup is any indication, Americans will be queuing up for the scanners. Seventy percent of those surveyed said that, for comfort reasons, they'd rather undergo a body scan than a pat-down. Another finding: More men than women support its use, with the majority of guys saying they have no qualms about being virtually strip-searched. To prepare for my scan, I had packed some essentials: a screwdriver, a Swiss Army knife, a container of Kiehl's lotion, a fork, a candle and an orange that could be used as a weapon or a snack. However, after seeing the company's buffet of (faux) hazardous material lined up on the countertop, I quickly abandoned my props for theirs. Before entering the chamber, I sneaked into the kitchen to accessorize my body, throwing a small Mini Moo's creamer into my bra at the last minute. Bulked up, I stepped onto the footprints and lifted my arms. My first spin was too fast, so I slowed the pace for the second turn, allowing the waves enough time to penetrate my threads. From my position, I could peek at the screen, and I was impressed: I looked like a terrorist-kicking avatar dressed in a liquid catsuit. Upon closer inspection, my superhero uniform fell away. I noticed the outlines of my underwear, tights and bra, and the mid-waist tie of my dress. A shot of my backside, revealing more than a plumber's peep show, made me realize that I needed to add squats to my exercise routine. I could see the glint of my dangly gold earrings and the white of my teeth. And then there was the odd placement of my navel, a small dot too far north. Of course, America's safety _ not my ego _ was on the line. So I got serious, discerning the various shapes atypical of the basic human form: the crinkly mass above my ribcage (the baggie of sugar), the shine by my shoulder (a paper clip), the dark shadow beside my heart (the Mini Moo's). I was a voodoo doll of danger. Miller eventually deleted my image, but my mind held on to it as I tried to grasp the new bare-it-all phase of airport security. In the end, I found it comforting to know that the body scanner would uncover items missed by older equipment and that we travelers have one more layer of protection against those exceedingly crafty terrorists. For that, I could live with an exposed bellybutton. sachsa@washpost.com "

1,"YouTube co-founder Steve Chen once warned a fellow co-founder to stop posting pirated videos on their Web site, according to court documents unsealed Thursday as part of a 3-year-old copyright lawsuit against the online video leader. That bit of intrigue was among the confidential information that had been kept under wraps since Viacom Inc. sued YouTube for alleged copyright infringement in a federal court in New York. The newly released evidence also revealed that Viacom wanted to buy YouTube before getting beat out by Google Inc., which acquired the site for $1.76 billion in 2006. Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and cable TV channels that include Comedy Central, sued YouTube in 2007 seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The media company alleges that YouTube allowed copyright-protected clips to appear on its Web site in its early days to attract a bigger audience. YouTube maintains it has always obeyed the Internet's copyright laws, which generally protect service providers from copyright claims as long as they didn't post the infringing material themselves and promptly remove it when notified about a violation. An e-mail exchange less than six months after YouTube's February 2005 inception showed that Chen knew Jawed Karim might be causing copyright trouble with his behavior. 'Jawed, please stop putting stolen videos on the site,' Chen wrote in the July 19, 2005, e-mail. 'We're going to have a tough time defending the fact that we're not liable for the copyrighted material on the site because we didn't put it up when one of the co-founders is blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it.' In a statement after the documents were unsealed, YouTube said Chen's e-mail was referring to some aviation videos that had been making the rounds on the Web. 'The exchange has nothing to do with supposed piracy of media content,' YouTube said. Karim left YouTube before Google bought it in 2006. One of the biggest disputes in the case is how YouTube monitored its site for copyright violations before Google bought it. Viacom contends YouTube's employees realized copyright-protected video was being illegally posted on the Web site, but routinely looked the other way because they knew the professionally produced material would help attract a bigger audience and encourage return visits. YouTube lawyers have contended there was no way to know whether copyright-protected video was coming from pirates or from movie and TV studios looking to use the Web site as a promotional tool. If a studio issued a notice of a copyright violation, YouTube says it promptly removed the specified clip as required under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Although other content producers also initially complained about copyright abuse at YouTube, many media companies have since struck revenue-sharing deals with the Web site. YouTube won over much of the professional media by developing technology that automatically detects video and audio claimed by its copyright owners. "
1,"Metals prices tumbled again Friday as traders remained concerned about a drop in Chinese demand and uncertainty about monetary policy in the U.S. China has rattled markets in recent days as top officials there say they'll clamp down on bank lending in an effort to slow rapid economic growth and prevent speculative bubbles. A slowdown in China's huge economy could push demand for metals and energy lower. Platinum, palladium and silver, which all have industrial uses, fell sharply. Platinum for April delivery dropped $47.60, or 3 percent, to settle at $1,544.50 an ounce. Palladium for March delivery dropped $13.85, or 3.1 percent, to $440.10 an ounce. March Silver fell 57.8 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $16.932 an ounce. Mark Hansen, director of trading at CPM Group, said commodities traders are also keeping a close eye on a looming vote in the Senate to confirm Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose term expires Jan. 31. Though he is expected to keep his job, that decision is not as certain as previously thought. Any change in who heads the Fed could have a major impact on interest rates, which in turn could strengthen or weaken the dollar. The dollar is one of the primary drivers of commodities prices, especially gold. Most commodities are priced in dollars and tend to fall when the dollar rises, which make them less attractive for foreign investors. Gold for February delivery fell $13.5 to settle at $1,089.70 an ounce. It hit a one-month low of $1,081.90 an ounce earlier in trading. Benchmark crude for March delivery lost $1.54 to settle at $74.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In other Nymex trading in February contracts, heating oil fell 4.4 cents to settle at $1.9416 a gallon, while gasoline lost 1.72 cents to settle at $1.9657 a gallon. Natural gas futures added 20.4 cents to settle at $5.819 per 1,000 cubic feet. Grain prices also fell. Wheat for March delivery fell 1 cent to $4.985 a bushel. Soybeans fell 2.5 cents to $9.515 a bushel, while corn fell 7.25 cents to $3.6475 a bushel. "
1,"(c) 2010, The Washington Post KABUL -- The decision by an independent commission to shutter more than 1,000 polling centers for Afghanistan's parliamentary elections Saturday has been touted as a way to reduce ballot fraud in unstable regions and produce transparent results that will restore the public's faith in the democratic process. But among the estimated 1.5 million Afghans who have been effectively disenfranchised, it may have a very different effect. Residents and candidates in these regions, mostly remote villages in dangerous southern and eastern provinces, said they worry that the move will deepen ethnic rivalries by creating electoral imbalances and accelerate a growing disengagement from the Afghan central government that has fed the Taliban's resurgence. 'In most of these places, the communities already have been somehow disconnected. People are living under very difficult circumstances,' said Ahmad Nader Nadery, chairman of the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan. 'This will give them more of a feeling they are left at the mercy of the Taliban and no major initiative is being taken to bring them back into the fold or provide them security.' That is precisely the scenario that the Independent Election Commission hoped to avoid when it announced this summer that it would close 1,019 of the country's 6,835 polling centers. After last year's fraud-plagued presidential election, in which Hamid Karzai was returned to office amid allegations of ballot stuffing and forged voter registration cards, commission officials and international groups hoped that the move would prevent abuses at insecure, poorly monitored polling stations. In 2009, the commission had planned to shut only a few hundred stations, but the Election Day chaos led hundreds more to be left out of the final vote tallies. This year, the affected voters, who represent about 12 percent of the country's estimated 13 million voters, are clustered largely in Afghanistan's east and south. Many people in these areas are, like the Taliban, ethnic Pashtuns, a population that has felt under-represented in government since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Though Karzai is a Pashtun, much of his cabinet is composed of ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras. The inability of large segments of the Pashtun population to participate in the elections has led some to fear that they will be even further marginalized in the next parliament. For example, in Ghazni, a diverse province of 1.3 million people, officials have closed 107 of the 379 polling centers, said Said Ismail Jahangir, spokesman for the governor, Mohammad Musa Akbar Zaba. Risal Di Aji A'ha, a Pashtun who lives in the Ajristan district of Ghazni, complained that most of the shuttered centers are in Pashtun areas. 'People who know the importance of the elections are very concerned about it having a negative long-term impact,' he said. Daoud Sultanzoy, a legislator running for re-election from Ghazni, said that not only do most of the polling stations in the Hazara and Tajik villages remain open but also reports of falsified voter registration cards could allow thousands of additional votes to be cast at those stations. 'This is not the fault of the Hazaras, and it's not the fault of the Pashtuns,' said Sultanzoy, who is a Pashtun. 'It's the fault of the government and international community that allowed Ghazni to get where it is. We knew a few years ago where Ghazni was headed, and we raised this question with everybody. The government has not reacted in time to fill that void.' Jahangir dismissed Sultanzoy's concerns, suggesting that voters in the areas where polls are being shut did not participate in large numbers in either the presidential election last year or the parliamentary elections five years ago. Opening the polls in those areas would have pointlessly taken away security forces and poll workers who are needed elsewhere. 'The ethnic makeup is not the main question,' Jahangir said. 'We have closed down some sites in areas which were safe, but the reason is due to the disinterest of the people last time.' At a news conference Wednesday, Ahmad Zia Rafat, a commissioner with the Electoral Complaints Commission, acknowledged that the independent body has 'received some complaints from some supporters of certain candidates who are being deprived of casting a vote.' The decision to close a polling station in Sarkand village in the eastern province of Nangahar shocked Malik Nazir Gul, an elder who joined other residents in petitioning the provincial office to reconsider. They pledged to provide their own security at the polls if the government was unable to do so, he said. Instead, the provincial office instructed the 3,000 Sarkand households to cast their ballots in Kaskoot. That village would take more than an hour to reach by car over recently flooded roads that are littered with improvised explosive devices planted by insurgents, Gul said. 'I think that the security commander of the province thought it was better to close down stations to make his job easier,' he said. 'Our worry is that the district will sort of be deleted (from representation), and people are very angry and sad about it.' Abdul Qayom, mayor of the Khiva District, which includes Sarkand, said that election officials informed him of the closures during a recent meeting in Jalalabad, the largest city in Nangahar. 'The reason was that these are far-flung areas and security is not very good there,' Qayom said, adding it was 'really hard (for security forces) to approach that area. The roads are not paved.' Gul glumly offered a potential remedy. 'We would have no choice but to join hands with the Pakistanis and become part of Pakistan,' he said. 'If they accept us.'

1,"Dick Francis a champion jockey for the British royal family who turned to writing crime fiction and helped launch an immensely popular sub-genre of mysteries set in the horse-racing world, died Feb. 14 at a home he kept in the Cayman Islands. No cause of death was reported, but he had prostate cancer diagnosed in the mid-1990s. He was 89. In a career spanning four decades and 42 novels, Francis sold more than 60 million books. His protagonists, often former jockeys themselves, caromed through page-turning murder plots and ruthless kidnapping schemes. They endured impossibly excruciating torture but solved the mystery, nabbed the bad-guy and usually got the girl. Reviewers said Francis captured the authentic smells, sounds and sights of the racetrack. Author Carol Flake once wrote in the New York Times that Francis' plots moved so quickly that 'one is tempted to handicap his books rather than review them, assigning each a speed rating and a weight allowance.' As a jockey in Britain after World War II, he won about 350 races during his nine-year career and was Champion Jockey of the 1953-54 season. His success led the Queen Mother to retain him as her jockey for the 1956 Grand National at Aintree, one of steeplechasing's top races. Francis often said that if a mystery had not unfolded literally underneath his feet at the Grand National during the mid-1950s, he might have never started writing at all. Known as one of the most challenging events for horse and man, the four-mile, 856-yard course is filled with tall jumps that if not cleared properly often lead to fatal crashes. Francis and his mount, Devon Loch, had survived the course and were in the lead strides away from the finish when the big, brown gelding suddenly collapsed in a heap. After the incident, the horse stood up, apparently uninjured and healthy. News of the spectacular spill spread across Britain, where photos of the horse splayed out on the turf accompanied many front-page news stories. Francis, then 37, retired from race riding months later, citing a body too plagued by injuries _ including six collar-bone breaks, five nose breaks, a fractured skull, a broken back and dislocated shoulders. He once suffered a gash on his face after a horse stepped on it. His fame as Britain's favorite failed hero led an agent to push him to write his autobiography, 'The Sport of Queens,' which came out in 1957 to positive reviews. He began writing for London's Sunday Express that year as an expert racing correspondent, an arrangement that continued for 16 years. Inspired by the success of his autobiography, and the slim wages of journalism work, Francis decided to write a crime mystery about a jockey who is killed in the middle of a race. 'Dead Cert' came out in 1962, and since then Francis wrote about a book a year. Reviewers sometimes called his writing formulaic and genre specific. But critic John Leonard, writing in the New York Times, said: 'Not to read Dick Francis because you don't like horses is like not reading Dostoyevsky because you don't like God.' His books were devoured by millions, and fans took pride in Francis's attention to detail and realism. Among his supporters was the Queen Mother, whom Francis sent an advance copy of each of his books before they were published. She'd return the favor with a handwritten note reviewing the work. 'How do you think these stories up?' she once wrote to him. 'You're getting more bloodthirsty than ever.' The answer was simple. Throughout his career, Francis often went to the track with his 'eyes and ears open.' An idea for a plot twist in one of his books _ a rare swine disease that kills several top race horses _ was suggested to him by a veterinarian. Richard Stanley Francis was born Oct. 31, 1920, near Tenby in South Wales. His father was a professional steeplechase jockey and later a stable manager. Francis would write his books sentence by sentence in longhand. His wife, the former Mary Brenchley, who died in 2000, edited and proofread his novels and helped him with his research. For his books 'Flying Finish' (1966) and 'Rat Race' (1970), which involve scenes on an aircraft, Francis did not just fall back on his years as a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II. He enrolled his wife in flying lessons to make sure he'd written authentic passages about taking the controls of an airplane mid-flight. Francis won many awards for his writing, including the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award an unprecedented three times. After he was widowed, Francis did not write for some time. Recently he began releasing titles co-authored with his son Felix. Their latest book, 'Even Money,' came out in September. Their next, 'Crossfire,' is scheduled to be released later this year. In addition to Felix, survivors include another son, Merrick. Before Francis began his writing career, he was unsure whether he'd be remembered for much else besides riding Devon Loch, the Queen Mother's fallen horse. 'I heard one man say to another, a little while ago, `Who did you say that was? Dick Francis? Oh yes, he's the man who didn't win the National,' ' Francis wrote in his autobiography. 'What an epitaph!' "
1,"As Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., winds down his 30-year run in the Senate, his top remaining priority _ a landmark piece of legislation that could shape his legacy _ is an effort to enact the greatest overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system since the Great Depression. Lawmakers, financial industry representatives, consumer advocates and other observers offered varying predictions Wednesday about how Dodd's pending retirement might influence his approach as he shepherds the reform bill through the Senate. But most agreed that Dodd's desire to leave behind meaningful changes, coupled with the freedom from a grueling and uncertain reelection campaign, bodes well for the prospect that a bipartisan bill could emerge from the Senate. 'I think this probably improves the chances for a financial rewrite,' said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a member of the Senate banking committee, which Dodd leads. He said Dodd's close relationship with the panel's ranking Republican, Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and the fact that 'this will be a legacy item for both of them,' creates 'the framework for a good bill.' Consumer advocates and financial lobbyists, who have long been at odds over the direction of financial reform, each held out hope Wednesday that a politically unencumbered Dodd might shape legislation more in line with their interests. 'I hope that he'll focus like a laser beam on reform,' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Mierzwinski's group has been pushing hard for changes such as the creation of an agency devoted to protecting consumers of financial products, which Dodd and the administration have called a top priority, but which has run into stiff resistance from Republicans and the banking industry. Mierzwinski said Dodd's decision might allow him to push harder for such measures. 'I think it could play to our advantage. He can worry more about the policy and not the politics,' he said. 'My guess is he's worried more about his legacy than he is about making compromises.' Meanwhile, groups such as the American Bankers Association, which has strongly opposed the new agency, hope that Dodd's decision actually leads him down the road of more compromise. 'If there was going to be a bill, it had to be a bipartisan bill with some significant compromises,' said ABA President Edward Yingling. 'He's now more free to move to a bipartisan compromise' rather than 'having to constantly look over his shoulder to see what the politics of it all might be in Connecticut.' Still, what remains is a massive and complicated piece of legislation, and reaching consensus will take more than good intentions. In November, Dodd unveiled an 1,136-page draft bill that adopted many of the administration's proposals but also put him at odds in certain areas with both the administration and House lawmakers, as well as several moderate Democrats on his own committee. In November, talks between Dodd and Shelby broke down, largely over Shelby's opposition to creating the new consumer agency. Last month, however, the two announced a return to the bargaining table. 'Our country needs financial regulatory reform and we are committed to working together on legislation to create a sound regulatory structure,' they said in a joint statement. Dodd's decision to retire means that Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. is likely to take over as chairman of the banking panel in the next Congress. Johnson, 63, suffered a brain hemorrhage in 2006 that impaired his speech and forced him to use a motorized scooter. When Dodd considered leaving the banking post in 2009 to head up a key panel dealing with health-care reform, some Democrats wondered privately whether Johnson was physically capable of succeeding Dodd as chairman. But Johnson's condition has improved, and a Senate leadership aide, granted anonymity to discuss a delicate issue, said that top Democrats didn't see his health as an impediment. Johnson is known as a champion of the credit card industry, as many card issuers have based their operations in South Dakota to take advantage of the state's absence of caps on the interest rates companies can charge. When the Senate passed a credit card reform bill in May, Johnson was one of just five senators {ndash} and the only Democrat {ndash} who voted against it. In the meantime, Dodd remains in the chairman's seat with the opportunity to put his stamp _ and possibly his name _ on a bill that could significantly alter the relationship between Washington and Wall Street. 'I may have the optimism of a neophyte, but I thought the chances were pretty good before,' Warner said of its prospects. 'If this removes one level of the partisan concerns, so much the better.' -0-< Staff writers Ben Pershing and David Cho contributed to this report. "
1,"SAN FRANCISCO - LivingSocial, the second-biggest website for daily deals, will use a $183 million investment led by Amazon.com to overtake market leader Groupon, the company's chief executive officer says. LivingSocial will more than triple its employees next year to 1,800 and more than double the number of cities where it offers deals, CEO Tim O'Shaughnessy said in his first interview since the Amazon.com investment was announced last week. That would bring the service to 300 markets, about the number that Groupon now serves with its staff of 3,000. 'Having a $183 million investment is an important part of making sure we're not bringing a knife to a gunfight,' O'Shaughnessy said. 'If you want to be the biggest player in local commerce, having an investor that's the biggest player in e-commerce seemed like a really smart thing to do.' O'Shaughnessy is taking a different path from Andrew Mason, his counterpart at Chicago-based Groupon who spurned an offer last week from Google. The $6 billion deal would have given Groupon financial backing from the cash-rich owner of the world's most-used Web search company. Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Groupon, didn't respond to requests for comment. The biggest daily-deal sites have to demonstrate that they offer more than just a list of consumer names to send offers to, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. 'The winner in this space will win not because they have the largest list, but the best list,' Mulpuru said in a blog posting. 'By that I mean, knowing who are the customers who will spend more than the value of the deal and who will come back to frequent a business. The company that can identify those people, even if it's just 100,000 customers, will win.' To that end, LivingSocial plans to expand internationally, develop programs to help merchants identify repeat customers and broaden its offerings. O'Shaughnessy founded the Washington-based company in 2007 to build social applications played on Facebook. Last year, he saw how quickly Groupon was growing and changed tack, hiring a national sales staff that now numbers 500 to bring in local merchants of its own. LivingSocial has at least one sales representative in each of its 120 geographic markets. It will use the recent investment, which includes $175 million from Amazon and $8 million from venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, to expand overseas and begin rolling out programs to help merchants retain shoppers. Most small and medium-sized merchants don't have any form of customer relationship management, an opportunity for LivingSocial, O'Shaughnessy said. 'What you'll see us do more of in 2011 is start to build a system where merchants can track their customers and can track who's coming back and how valuable are they, and really give them more insights into their business,' O'Shaughnessy said. LivingSocial also will begin focusing more on excursions such as skeet shooting and beer tasting. In October, the company bought Urban Escapes, which offers deals on vacations, events and guided tours. By mid-November, LivingSocial had sold more than 10,000 such trips, which it dubs 'Escapes.' While the deals are usually riskier for the company, since they may involve renting out a venue in advance, they typically have higher margins than most products sold on daily-deal sites, O'Shaughnessy said. Groupon, which started in November 2008, has 35 million registered users and is set to record revenue of more than $500 million this year, according to two people familiar with the matter. LivingSocial says it will reach that milestone in 2011. Groupon and LivingSocial control more than 90 percent of the daily-deal market, O'Shaughnessy said. LivingSocial is gaining a few percentage points of share every month, he said. Both companies are chasing the local advertising market, which is estimated at $133 billion in the U.S. this year and is moving online and away from print, radio and direct mail, according to consulting firm BIA/Kelsey in Chantilly, Va. With hundreds of companies in the daily-deal industry, including BuyWithMe.com and Tippr.com, there is a risk that they will undercut one another on price, driving down profit margins. Those concerns are overblown, O'Shaughnessy said. 'One of the common misperceptions is that getting into the space is all you need to do,' O'Shaughnessy said. In reality, expanding the business and developing relationships with merchants 'is much harder to do than most people realize.' --With reporting by Douglas MacMillan in San Francisco. "
1,"Maarten Stekelenburg never doubted he would be back in goal for the Netherlands, even when repeated injuries sidelined him and he was left out of the team by club side Ajax. The Dutch goalkeeping crisis was so acute last year -- with Stekelenburg on the Ajax bench and two other keepers injured -- that coach Bert van Marwijk pleaded with Edwin van der Sar to return from retirement for a pair of World Cup qualifiers. The Manchester United No. 1 and most capped Netherlands player turned him down and Stekelenburg's path back to Oranje was assured. Van Marwijk selected him for the qualifiers against Scotland and Macedonia and he repaid his coach's confidence by keeping clean sheets in both matches. 'I was not afraid I would not come back because I know what I can do and I think I've demonstrated that,' Stekelenburg said. 'But it was a tough year last year. Maybe mentally it was good for me.' The 27-year-old has now played 31 times for the Netherlands since making his debut as Van der Sar's deputy in September 2004. Now he is looking forward to facing Brazil in Friday's World Cup quarterfinals after making two crucial saves to help the Netherlands beat Slovakia 2-1 in the round of 16. 'At a crucial stage Maarten Stekelenburg saved us,' Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said. The crucial moment was the 67th minute, with the Netherlands defending a precarious 1-0 lead and the momentum of the match swinging toward Slovakia. Buoyed by beating defending champion Italy 3-2 in its previous match, Slovakia poured forward in search of an equalizer. In rapid succession, Stekelenburg tipped a powerful shot from Miroslav Stoch over the crossbar and then parried a close-range effort by Robert Vittek. 'Those two saves kept us in the match. They were two good shots,' Stekelenburg said. 'After that we regained the initiative.' Stekelenburg has only let in two goals in the Netherlands' four matches at the World Cup -- both penalties. Samuel Eto'o beat him in the 2-1 win over Cameroon when the Dutch already were qualified for the next round, and Vittek scored a consolation penalty for Slovakia with the last kick of the match after Stekelenburg had brought down substitute Martin Jakubko. The foul momentarily put Stekelenburg's place in the quarterfinal in doubt as referee Alberto Undiano reached into his pocket for a card that turned out to be yellow instead of red. Stekelenburg said he was not afraid he would be sent off for bringing down a player who had broken through to shoot. 'He was running toward the sideline and I think there was a defender on the goal line,' he said. 'But you never know.' "

1,"A Florida jury awarded a couple $2.5 million in damages Friday in the first U.S. jury trial over defective drywall from China. A state court panel in Miami deliberated more than a day before finding Banner Supply Co. 55 percent responsible for damage done to the home of Armin and Lisa Seifart. The jury found a company not included in the lawsuit, Germany's Knauf Group, 35 percent liable. The plaintiffs had sought $4.3 million for loss of enjoyment of their home and other damages. 'It sets a precedent to the extent that we were able to see what a jury thinks about this case,' said Ervin Gonzalez, attorney for the Seifarts. USG Corp. and Knauf are among about 1,000 defendants that may face claims they distributed defective drywall manufactured in China. The cases, part of coordinated litigation over allegedly defective drywall, are intended as a bellwether to help determine property damage issues in other cases against manufacturers. More than 2,100 people in the U.S. have sued in federal court claiming damages from drywall made in China. As many as 40,000 plaintiffs may bring claims, U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon of New Orleans, who is overseeing the lawsuits nationwide, said last month. The Seifarts bought their home in February 2008. After less than a year they learned their problems with appliances and a sulfur smell originated with the drywall. Banner countered that the Seifarts should be reimbursed for the cost of repairs only, urging the jury not to make an award for loss of enjoyment or the reduction of the value to the home. 'We are a bit disappointed and we will weigh all of our rights, including our appellate rights,' Banner's attorney, Todd Ehrenreich said after the verdict. "
1,"When Roseanne Morrison was scouting new street looks in Manhattan's Meatpacking District late last year, she spotted a young woman sporting brown lace-up boots, blue jeans and an attitude. 'It was kind of insouciant, `I just rolled out of bed and threw my boots on,'' said Morrison, fashion director at New York retail consultant Doneger Group. 'I knew this was something different and that it was going to drive a new look.' That freshness has pushed even luxury designers such as Christian Louboutin to market so-called combat boots, with peep-toe platform versions going for $1,495. Women are pairing them with shorts, miniskirts and floral dresses, helping to make boots the fastest-growing part of women's fashion footwear in spite of scorching weather in cities like New York and Miami. Boot sales surged 37 percent in the year through April, bolstering a rebound in luxury spending as the economic recovery strengthens. Stars Miley Cyrus and Chloe Sevigny are wearing styles from military to motorcycle, prompting retailers Neiman Marcus Group and Barneys New York to stock Louboutin and Rag & Bone to appeal to upscale shoppers. 'It's a way of saying, `I am a tough, cool and bad girl and don't mess with me,' and at the same time, women want to stay feminine,' said Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys New York. 'The only faux pas is not to have confidence. You have to look like you can kick some butt.' Women are shopping for themselves again after surviving the worst economic slump since the Great Depression. Bain & Co. projects U.S. luxury sales will rise 4 percent this year after falling 17 percent to $54 billion in 2009. The chunky boot trend was popular during a previous slowdown in the `90s. Back then, so-called grunge music fans embraced the look, an evolution of what punk rockers wore in the '70s, Doonan said. The 'mother ship,' he said, is the thick- soled Dr. Martens that became popular during that era, which typically cost $100 to $200. What's different now is that the look is 'less rocker, more rugged,' according to Morrison, who specializes in trend analysis at the 64-year-old Doneger Group. It's part of a return to a broader military trend in fashion, which includes trench coats and utility pants, and is no longer limited to black. Fashion houses that have sent combat boots down the runways in recent years include Alexander Wang and Chloe. Limi Feu showed them in Paris for the spring/summer 2010 season, with voluminous short dresses. Balmain and Ann Demeulemeester have weighed in with their own interpretations. Neiman Marcus sells the $1,495 Louboutin version, with six-inch heels and the designer's signature red sole. Barneys New York features the women's Rag & Bone combat boots, both in black and beige, with canvas, for $495. The British label AllSaints Spitalfields displayed five types of women's combat boots -- including light-colored 'chalk' and 'stone' ones -- when it opened a store in New York's SoHo district on May 21. They are priced $250 to $280. Jennifer Kline, a 44-year-old mother of two sons and professional model who lives in Wayzata, Minn., said she's one woman who's saving her money for another style. 'It's horribly unattractive, and it doesn't flatter anybody,' said Kline, who has modeled for magazines including Vogue, Shape and Newsweek. 'It looks like you're trying too hard to be cool. For the summer, it's too heavy.' Nevertheless, the combat-boot trend 'underscores how less- seasonal style is becoming,' said Marshal Cohen, NPD's chief industry analyst. Boots' share of women's footwear sales climbed to 5.2 percent in last year's second quarter from 4.6 percent a year earlier. That share expanded to 13 percent in the third quarter from 12.4 percent, according to NPD. Women previously wore other boots after Memorial Day, pairing Deckers Outdoor Corp.'s Ugg Australia sheepskin styles with shorts. Fashionistas who can't stand the heat should look to shorter styles and open-toe versions -- though comfort isn't what matters most, Morrison said. 'Stilettos, they aren't comfortable either, but they have been on trend for some time now,' she said. 'Fashion first.' With assistance from Viola Gienger in Washington. "
1,"Construction workers hoping to speed up the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site chanted 'Build it now!' at a rally Tuesday to urge quicker movement on the project. Construction is under way on 1 World Trade Center, a memorial and a transit hub, but the building of other planned towers has stalled as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey battles developer Larry Silverstein. The authority, which controls the property, wants more private-sector cash for the project than Silverstein has offered and prefers to delay construction on two of the towers until the real estate market improves. An arbitration panel gave the two sides until Friday to hammer out a new schedule for rebuilding parts of the site of the 2001 terror attacks. Port Authority Executive Director Chris Ward said Tuesday the authority 'is not willing to do a public bailout of Larry Silverstein.' Addressing several hundred workers gathered next to the site, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney said, 'Instead of a shining American symbol of resilience and strength, we have a hole in the ground.' She said that rebuilding after the attacks is a moral imperative, and putting 10,000 people to work is an economic imperative. "
1,"A top Federal Reserve official said Thursday he's worried about the weakness of the U.S. economic recovery but doesn't think it will slip into another recession. William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with The Associated Press: 'I think we do have a sustainable economic recovery.' But he added: 'I'm less confident how strong that recovery will be.' The odds that the economy will fall back into recession 'are low, but not zero,' he said. To energize the recovery, the Fed has pledged to hold interest rates at record lows for an 'extended period,' which some analysts say means at least six months. Dudley said that with unemployment high and factories operating well below capacity, the Fed can be 'quite patient' before reversing course and raising rates. The New York Fed chief also left the door open to a possible extension of an emergency program aimed at driving down mortgage rates and bolstering the housing market. The Fed is on track to end its $1.25 trillion purchases of mortgage securities at the end of March. If the economy were to turn much weaker than expected or if mortgage rates were to sharply rise, it could prompt the Fed to extend the program, Dudley said. Dudley likened the situation to the Fed driving a car. 'If there's a sharp turn in the road,' the Fed will adjust course. 'Nothing is on automatic pilot,' he said. For now, Dudley doesn't think mortgage rates will jump when the program ends because the Fed has put investors on notice for months about the March 31 end date. Some worry that the Fed's record-low interest rates near zero could feed some new speculative bubble. The Fed has left rates at record lows for more than a year. Dudley said he doesn't see any new bubbles 'at this stage.' 'A lot of the improvement in asset prices is desirable,' reflecting the economic recovery, he said. On the Fed's unpopular bailout of insurance giant American International Group Inc., Dudley indicated the Fed didn't have the time or leverage to extract concessions from AIG's Wall Street trading partners, which ended up being paid in full by AIG. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's Senate battle last week to win confirmation for a second term hasn't hurt the Fed boss' effectiveness 'one iota,' Dudley said. But the spectacle does raise concerns about Congress trying to nibble at the Fed's independence, he said. The Fed must make decisions that might be unpopular but right for the economy without interference from Congress, Dudley said. "
1,"A federal jury on Monday convicted an Indian-born former stealth bomber engineer of selling military secrets to China. Noshir Gowadia was convicted on 14 counts, including conspiracy, violating the arms export control act and money laundering. He was found not guilty on three counts of communicating national defense information to aid a foreign nation. Gowadia, who has been in federal custody for nearly four years, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in November. The decision came after six days of deliberations at a federal court in Honolulu. Prosecutors accused Gowadia of helping China design a stealth cruise missile. They alleged he pocketed $110,000 over two years for his exhaust nozzle design. The trial lasted nearly four months. The 67-year-old from Maui has spent almost five years in federal detention since his October 2005 arrest after a judge ruled he was a flight risk. Gowadia helped design the propulsion system for the B-2 bomber when he worked at Northrop Corp., now known as Northrop Grumman Corp. between 1968 and 1986. Prosecutors argued that Gowadia helped China design a cruise missile exhaust nozzle that would give off less heat, allowing the cruise missile to evade infrared radar detection and U.S. heat-seeking missiles. They said Gowadia traveled to China between 2003 and 2005 while designing the cruise missile and used e-mail to arrange payment for his work. During closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson told jurors Gowadia designed the exhaust nozzle to raise money to pay a $15,000-a-month mortgage on the mansion-like home he built on Maui's north shore. Gowadia's defense attorney, David Klein, told jurors it was true the engineer designed an exhaust nozzle for China. But he said Gowadia's design was 'basic stuff' based on unclassified information that was already publicly available. Prosecutors also charged Gowadia with attempting to sell classified stealth technology to the Swiss government and businesses in Israel and Germany. Born in India, Gowadia moved to the U.S. for postgraduate work in the 1960s and became a U.S. citizen about a decade later. He retired from Northrop for health reasons in 1986, two years before the B-2 made its public debut. He moved to Maui in 1999 from the U.S. mainland where he had been doing consulting work after retiring from Northrop. The case is one of a series of major prosecutions targeting alleged Chinese spying on the U.S. In March, Chinese-born engineer Dongfan 'Greg' Chung was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison after he was convicted of six counts of economic espionage and other federal charges. Investigators learned about Chung while probing Chi Mak, a defense contractor engineer convicted in 2007 of conspiracy to export U.S. defense technology to China. Mak was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2008. "
1,"SAN FRANCISCO - Home seizures fell 9 percent in October from the previous month, the biggest decline in a year, as attorneys general began a nationwide probe into lender foreclosure practices, according to RealtyTrac Inc. The number of properties taken back by banks fell to 93,236 last month from a record 102,134 in September, the Irvine, Calif.-based data seller said Thursday in a report. Foreclosure filings, which also include default and auction notices, fell 4 percent from the previous month to 332,172 and were little changed from a year earlier. One in 389 households got a filing. Top legal officers in all 50 states began a coordinated inquiry on Oct. 13 into whether banks and loan servicers used false documents and signatures on hundreds of thousands of foreclosures in a process known as 'robo-signing.' The probe is on a 'fast track' and may lead to multiple settlements, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the leader of the investigation, said in an interview this week. Foreclosures last month 'probably would have been higher except for the fallout from the recent 'robo-signing' controversy,' RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer James J. Saccacio said in a statement. The probes are likely to result in further declines in home seizures in November, he said. Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, temporarily halted repossessions nationwide as it reviewed processes, while JPMorgan Chase and Ally Financial's GMAC unit froze home seizures in states where courts oversee foreclosures. A prolonged decline in repossessions threatens to hurt U.S. home sales. Almost a third of all transactions in September involved distressed properties, according to RealtyTrac. In Florida, the state with the second-highest rate of filings, completed foreclosure cases in the 17th Judicial Circuit fell to 310 in the week of Oct. 4 from 955 the prior week because of the moratoriums, Chief Judge Victor Tobin said in a telephone interview. The pace may return to pre-review levels after lenders improve procedures, he said. 'I anticipate within three to four weeks it will pick back up,' said Tobin, whose circuit includes Broward County, home of Fort Lauderdale. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. now has 'enhanced procedures' to process home seizures, the Pittsburgh-based lender said Nov. 9. PNC stopped sales of foreclosed homes last month as investors showed concern about buying mortgage assets, Chief Financial Officer Richard J. Johnson said last week. Home repossessions reached records in four of the last seven months as banks accelerated actions against delinquent homeowners, according to RealtyTrac. The October seizures were up 21 percent from a year earlier. The month-over-month decline was the largest since October 2009, RealtyTrac said. Repossessions fell on a monthly basis in 33 states, while 14 states showed year-over-year declines. Default notices, the first stage of foreclosure, were sent to 100,575 properties last month, down 2 percent from September and 19 percent from a year earlier, RealtyTrac said. They fell in California, Nevada and Michigan on a monthly basis while rising in Florida, Ohio and Illinois. Foreclosure auctions, the second stage in the process, were scheduled on 138,361 properties in October, down 3 percent from September and up 6 percent from a year earlier. Auctions decreased from the previous month in 26 states and the District of Columbia. Nevada had the highest foreclosure filing rate at one in every 79 households, almost five times the national average. A total of 14,205 homes in the state received filings, down 13 percent from September and up 3 percent from a year earlier. One in 155 Florida households received a filing. Arizona ranked third at one in 165. Other states with the 10 highest rates were California, Michigan, Utah, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois and Colorado. Five states accounted for more than half of all filings, led by California's 66,475, a fifth of the national total. Filings in the most populous state were down 12 percent from September and 22 percent from a year earlier. Florida ranked second with 56,858 filings, down 4.5 percent from September and up 9.5 percent from October 2009, RealtyTrac said. Michigan was third at 19,288, down 12 percent from September and up 17 percent from a year earlier. Illinois had 16,969 filings and Arizona had 16,538. Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Texas and Washington rounded out the top 10, according to RealtyTrac, which sells default data from counties representing 90 percent of the population. --With assistance from Margaret Cronin Fisk in Detroit.

1,"Go ahead. It's okay to laugh at al-Qaida. It's okay to call Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab the Underbomber, or even the Tighty- Whitey Terrorist. It's okay to call his explosive-bearing undergarment the Jihad Jockeys or the Frighty Whities or Fruit of the Boom. It's okay to laugh about the 'wardrobe malfunction' that kept the bomb in his pants from going off in a plane over Detroit, and about the likelihood that even if the underpants bomb had exploded, there would be '72 very disappointed virgins' when the martyr got to heaven. It is probably even okay to put a photo of the terrorist's singed briefs on the cover of the New York Post with the headlines 'GREAT BALLS OF FIRE' and 'Blast Packing Undies are the Real Hot Pants.' This is all okay because, for all the hand-wringing and finger-pointing surrounding the failed Christmas Day attack, the real lesson of the botched bombing is a happy one: If this is the worst al- Qaida can do, we're in good shape. Yes, it's bad that U.S. authorities missed all the red flags and let Abdulmutallab get so close to success. And it would have been really, really bad if he had blown up the plane. But the dismay of the past two weeks misses a larger point: that the nature of the attack shows just how lame al-Qaida really is. Eight years ago, most experts were convinced that the terrorists would have hit us with a dirty bomb by now. Dirty underpants just aren't as menacing. Remember some of these Post headlines in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks? 'Fears Prompt U.S. to Beef Up Nuclear Terror Detection; Sensors Deployed Near D.C., Borders; Delta Force on Standby'; 'U.S. Fears Bin Laden Made Nuclear Strides; Concern Over `Dirty Bomb' Affects Security'; 'Shadow Government Is at Work in Secret; After Attacks, Bush Ordered 100 Officials to Bunkers Away From Capital to Ensure Federal Survival'; 'Terrorist Attacks Imminent, FBI Warns; ... Assaults on U.S. Called Possible in `Next Several Days' '; 'Al-Qaida May Have Crude Chemical, Germ Capabilities.' But instead of WMD, we got BVDs. 'Blowing up an individual plane is terrible, but it's nothing compared to the catastrophic terrorism risk that most of us feared we'd see soon after 9/11,' said Joe Cirincione, an expert on nuclear terrorism who is president of the Ploughshares Fund. 'We figured there would be a huge escalation in the terrorist attacks.' What emerged instead, he added, was 'one crazy 23-year-old kid with plastic explosives _ this is not the kind of sophisticated attack you'd need to do something like a nuclear weapon.' In part, we overestimated (or, in the case of the Bush administration, perhaps exaggerated) the threat from al-Qaida. In part, the post-Sept. 11 efforts to strengthen the borders and disrupt terrorist operations have worked. Whatever the cause, al-Qaida is now less an organization than a bunch of loosely affiliated cells. These cells are capable of inflicting plenty of pain, as a suicide bomber's killing of seven Americans at a CIA base in Afghanistan last month reminded us. But they do not pose an existential threat to the United States. They can put a kid on a plane with plastic explosives in his pants, but they still can't destroy a U.S. city with loose nukes. This isn't a reason to declare victory or to pull back from the fight, but it is cause to be thankful that things aren't as bad as we thought they'd be. Keeping al-Qaida to this level of 'nuisance' terrorism should be the goal. Attacks by small, uncoordinated cells are harder to prevent, but they aren't as devastating. In the war on terrorism, limiting the enemy to his Frighty Whities is about the best we can hope for. Certainly, the Obama administration should patch the holes in aviation security and fix the newly uncovered gaps in intelligence. But it's more important to redirect some of this frenzy over the underwear bomb to where it really matters: keeping nuclear materials away from terrorists. The president has pledged to do this, and he's gathering some 40 heads of state in Washington in April for the Nuclear Security Summit. Their goal should be to secure remaining nuclear material before al-Qaida and al-Qaida-like groups can get to it, and to end the civilian use of highly enriched uranium. If they can do that _ and that's a big 'if' _ al-Qaida really will be nothing more than Fruit-of-the-Loom fanatics. And the joke will be on them. "
1,"Thick, sticky oil crept deeper into delicate marshes of the Mississippi Delta, an arrival dreaded for a month since the crude started spewing into the Gulf, as anger and frustration mounted over efforts to plug the gusher from a blown-out well and contain the spill. Up to now, only tar balls and a sheen of oil had come ashore. But chocolate brown and vivid orange globs and sheets of foul-smelling oil the consistency of latex paint have begun coating the reeds and grasses of Louisiana's wetlands, home to rare birds, mammals and a rich variety of marine life. With each passing day, outrage grows. State and local officials say the federal government isn't doing enough. President Barack Obama faults the agency that oversees offshore drilling. Republicans say the Coast Guard and the administration should have done more. A deep, stagnant ooze sat in the middle of a particularly devastated marsh off the Louisiana coast where Emily Guidry Schatzel of the National Wildlife Federation was examining stained reeds. 'This is just heartbreaking,' she said with a sigh. 'I can't believe it.' Fingers are also pointing at BP PLC, not only for the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig and the deaths of 11 workers, but for the gusher of oil that flowed entirely uncontained until this past weekend. The company, which was leasing the rig, conceded Thursday what some scientists have been saying for weeks: More oil is flowing from the leak than BP and the Coast Guard had previously estimated. 'It's anger at the people who are supposed to be driving the ship don't have any idea what's going on,' said E.J. Boles, 55, a musician from Big Pine Key, Florida. 'Why wouldn't they have any contingency plan? I'm not a genius and even I would have thought of that.' A live video feed of the underwater gusher, posted online after lawmakers exerted pressure on BP, is sure to fuel the anger. It shows what appears to be a large plume of oil and gas still spewing into the water next to the stopper-and-tube combination that BP inserted to carry some of the crude to the surface. The House committee website where the video was posted promptly crashed because so many people were trying to view it. 'I think now we're beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP,' said Democratic congressman Edward J. Markey. 'BP has lost all credibility ... It's clear that they have been hiding the actual consequences of this spill.' At least 6 million gallons (22.7 million liters) have gushed into the Gulf since the explosion, more than half of what the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled in Alaska in 1989. A growing number of scientists believe it's more. BP spokesman Mark Proegler told The Associated Press that the mile-long tube inserted into a leaking pipe over the weekend is capturing 210,000 gallons (800,000 liters) of oil a day -- the total amount the company and the Coast Guard have estimated is gushing into the sea -- but some is still escaping. He would not say how much. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a team including scientists is working on a new estimate of how much oil is gushing from the well. Agency officials would not speculate on how big the leak might be. Washington, meanwhile, has turned up the pressure on BP. The Obama administration asked the company to be more open with the public by sharing such information as measurements of the leak and the trajectory of the spill. BP has been accused of covering up the magnitude of the disaster. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency directed BP to employ a less toxic form of the chemical dispersants it has been using to break up the oil and keep it from reaching the surface. BP is marshaling equipment for an attempt as early as Sunday at a 'top kill,' which involves pumping heavy mud into the top of the blown-out well to try to plug the gusher. If it doesn't work, the backup plans include a 'junk shot' -- shooting golf balls, shredded tires, knotted rope and other material into the well to clog it up. 'We're now looking at a scenario where response plans include lighting the ocean on fire, pouring potent chemicals into the water, and using trash and human hair to stop the flow of oil,' said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, in a letter to Obama calling for a formal moratorium on new offshore drilling permits. 'If this is the backup plan, we need to rethink taking the risk in the first place.' Lawmakers wonder why the company has to invent remedies on the fly. 'Shouldn't you have thought of a worst-case scenario and prepared for it and had this type of technology from day one?' congressman Steve Cohen asked BP America President Lamar McKay during a hearing. He's not the only one with questions. In New York, a morning show anchor pressed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to accept responsibility; he didn't. In London, activists strung a banner at BP headquarters, rechristening the oil company, 'BP, British Polluters.' And on Facebook, tens of thousands join groups with names such as 'I demand to know how much of BP's oil is in the Gulf.' Ask Vincent Creel, spokesman for the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, about the spill and his words nearly spew, like a leak he can't control. The oil hasn't hit shore here, he says, but it overshadows everything, including a major golf tournament. It is an economic and PR nightmare. 'It's staying out at sea so far,' he said, 'and yet it's bringing doom to our shores.' Patience was wearing thin among state and local officials who called on Obama to take a larger role in the fight against oil invading the Louisiana coast. 'We've given BP enough time,' said Jefferson Parish Councilman John Young. 'Everything in that marsh is dead as we speak,' Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said after touring the clogged marshes. 'Had you fallen off that boat yesterday and come up breathing that stuff, you probably wouldn't be here, either.' ------ Smith reported from Morgantown, West Virgina.

1,"NEW YORK - Most stocks fell Thursday, a day after benchmark measures climbed to a five-week high, as a lower-than- estimated profit forecast from FedEx overshadowed gains in technology shares before Apple's release of the iPad tablet computer in China. About two stocks fell for each that rose. The S&P 500 declined less than 0.1 percent to 1,124.66 at 4 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 22.10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,594.83, the highest since Aug. 10. 'It's an uneven recovery,' said Russ Koesterich, the San Francisco-based head of investment strategy for scientific active equities at BlackRock, the largest asset manager. 'The economic numbers continue to be mixed. A negative outlook from the shipping industry supports the notion that the U.S. recovery is going to be anemic.' The S&P 500 has lost 7.6 percent from its 2010 high in April amid mounting evidence of a slowdown in the world's largest economy. The drop pushed the index's valuation to about 12.2 times estimated profits for the next year, near the lowest since March 2009. The gauge has risen 7.2 percent so far this month and is on pace for the best September since 1954. Transportation companies, which are considered a proxy for economic growth, had the biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 24 industries, falling 1.2 percent. FedEx, the second-biggest U.S. package-shipment company, dropped 3.8 percent to $82.72 after forecasting earnings for the current quarter that fell short of analysts' estimates, and said it will eliminate 1,700 jobs. Net income for the three months ending in November will be $1.15 a share to $1.35 a share, the Memphis, Tenn.- based company said in a statement. Analysts projected $1.37 a share, the average of 19 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. A gauge of 12 home builders in the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, the most in more than a month. U.S. home seizures reached a record for the third time in five months in August as lenders completed the foreclosure process for thousands of delinquent owners, according to RealtyTrac. PulteGroup, the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, sank 3.9 percent to $8.24, the second-biggest decline in the S&P 500. KB Home, the U.S. home builder that targets first-time buyers, fell 3.9 percent to $11.27. Apple led technology shares up 0.7 percent, the biggest gain among 10 S&P 500 industries ahead of the release of its iPad tablet computer in China. Technology shares in the S&P 500 have climbed for seven straight days, the longest streak since July. Microsoft has rallied this week after a person familiar with the matter said the largest software company may sell debt to return cash to shareholders. Cisco Systems has advanced after saying Sept. 14 that it will start paying a dividend. 'Tech companies are attractive,' said Philip Orlando, the New York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. 'They are cash-rich. As investors see the economic data firming up, they'll say - wait a minute, this is a soft patch, not a double-dip recession.' Stock futures pared losses temporarily after reports showed demand is strong enough to prevent deflation and jobless claims were lower than economists had predicted. The producer price index increased 0.4 percent, the most in five months and twice the gain in July, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast was for a 0.3 percent rise, according to a Bloomberg News survey. A measure excluding volatile food and energy costs climbed 0.1 percent. Another report showed that jobless claims dropped by 3,000 to 450,000 in the week ended Sept. 11, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast was for a rise to 459,000, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The total number of people receiving unemployment insurance fell, and those getting extended payments plunged. Stocks also pared losses after a report showed that the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's general economic index rose to minus 0.7 this month from minus 7.7 in August. Readings less than zero signal contraction in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected the gauge would turn positive. Ford led a gauge of companies in the automobile industry up 3 percent, the biggest gain among 24 groups in the S&P 500. Barclays upgraded the second- biggest U.S. carmaker to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight,' citing improved earnings power because of cost cutting and pricing. Ford rallied 4.8 percent to $12.44. GameStop gained 4.4 percent to $19.40. The world's largest video-game retailer said it will buy back $500 million in shares and debt. "
1,"Move over Green Lantern. The new stars of this week's Comic-Con International comic-book festival may be Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake. Like Hollywood studios, Mattel and Hasbro view the annual Comic-Con gathering in San Diego, the biggest U.S. comic-book and movie convention, as a pipeline to fans who can build buzz for new products. They're pushing to put toys in films and on TV, and see the show as more than a nerd-fest. 'It's turned from a fanboy event to a family event,' said Doug Wadleigh, vice president of boys action play marketing for Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif. 'Parents are bringing their kids.' About 40 percent of this year's attendees will be female, the organizers say. Mattel and Hasbro, the world's largest toy companies, will sell limited-edition dolls and offer peeks at new products to an estimated 125,000 fans registered to attend the event that started Friday. Hasbro is bringing figures based on characters from 'G.I. Joe' and 'Transformers.' Mattel is producing 'Masters of the Universe' and 'Ghostbusters' toys. Mattel is spotlighting girls toys at Comic-Con for the first time, Wadleigh said in an interview. Barbie has a booth and the company is selling a limited-edition Polly Pocket figure, he said. Mattel is also promoting Monster High, a toy line that targets girls. Worldwide toy sales rose 3.6 percent to $80.3 billion last year, according to researcher NPD Group based in Port Washington, N.Y. Adult collectors spend more than $1 billion a year on film and comic-related products and even more on toys for their children, according to Jim Silver, editor-in- chief of TimetoPlayMag.com and Royalties$ magazine. Limited-edition toys are a popular draw. 'It gets your fans talking,' Silver said. 'They talk a lot on the Web. If you do a really great collector's item, it can enhance the overall value of that toy line.' Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., is offering an exclusive Strawberry Shortcake doll and a My Little Pony figure. Typically, 1,500 or so copies of exclusive toys are made and are sold only at Comic-Con, Silver said. 'Exclusives are really what bring people in,' Silver said. Comic-Con also gives the toymakers an opportunity to showcase products at the same time studios are promoting movies that the toys inspired. Hasbro's Transformers and G.I. Joe toys both have become the basis for big-budget movies produced by Viacom's Paramount Pictures. Sales of Transformers toys and merchandise rose to $590 million last year with the release of the second movie from $480 million in 2007, when the first film was released, John Frascotti, Hasbro's global chief marketing officer, said in an interview. In October, Hasbro will start a new cable television channel, The Hub, with Discovery Communications Inc. The programming will include shows based on Hasbro toys, including Transformers, G.I. Joe and Strawberry Shortcake, according to a May 17 statement from the companies. Mattel is considering a movie based on the 'Monster High' toy line, Wadleigh said. The company also is trying to develop a film based on the 1980s' 'Masters of the Universe' TV show. The idea, he said, is for consumers to spend more time with Mattel products. 'Adults like to engage in play, whether it's games or action-figure collecting,' Wadleigh said. 'This playful attitude in society is one we're really focusing on as a company. I don't know where it's going to take us, but it is an exciting new direction.' The first Comic-Con in 1970 focused on comics and novels and had guests including author Ray Bradbury, according to the convention's Web site. Things changed as Hollywood studios began making basing more films on comic-book characters. This year, Warner Bros. will host a presentation on 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I,' based on the last book in the series by J.K. Rowling. The film is scheduled for release In November. Walt Disney will show footage from 'Tron: Legacy,' due in theaters in December. Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake aren't the only variations. Television networks are promoting shows that don't fit with the usual Comic-con fare, such as comedies, along with horror series such as the vampire saga 'True Blood' on Time Warner's HBO. News Corp.'s FX cable network will host a presentation about 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,' a comedy starring Danny DeVito. General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal will screen footage of 'Community,' a comedy series about students at a community college. Some hard-core fans don't like the shift away from science fiction, horror and fantasy. But most embrace it, said Jonah Weiland, owner of the web site Comic Book Resources. 'There is a smaller group, very vocal, who like the old days when Comic-Con was just a comic-book convention,' said Weiland, who has attended for the past 18 years. 'But truth be told, Comic-Con was never just a comic convention.' "
1,"The federal government will bear virtually the entire cost of expanding Medicaid under the new health-care law, according to a comprehensive new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that directly rebuts the loud protests of governors warning about its impact on their strapped state budgets. About half of the increase in health insurance coverage under the new law is expected to come from expanding Medicaid in 2014 to a new nationwide eligibility threshold of 133 percent of the poverty level _ $14,400 for a single adult or $29,300 for a family of four. A disproportionate share of the 16 million people expected to enroll in the expanded Medicaid live in states in the South and West that until now have had very stringent eligibility rules for low-income adults. Governors of many of those states have predicted fiscal calamity for their budgets, and some have cited the Medicaid expansion in the suits they have filed against the new law, saying it violates their states' rights. But the Kaiser study released Wednesday predicts that the increase in state spending will be relatively small when weighed against the broad expansion of health coverage for their residents and the huge influx of federal dollars to cover most of the cost. Even the small increase in Medicaid costs may be canceled out by the savings states will enjoy from no longer having to subsidize the uncompensated care of uninsured people who will be on Medicaid, study co-author John Holahan said. 'It's absurd,' Holahan, an Urban Institute researcher, said of the states' doom and gloom predictions. 'They come out ahead. It's just crazy.' The federal government splits the cost of Medicaid with the states, ranging from a 50-50 split in wealthy states to more than 75 percent in poor states, for a nationwide average of 57 percent, although it has been paying higher rates under the economic stimulus package. Under the new law, the federal government will pick up 100 percent of the cost for all newly eligible people through 2016, a rate that will drop gradually to a 90 percent match in 2020 and beyond. The federal government will continue to pay its existing match rates for people who would have already been eligible under their states' current rules. But the study's authors predict that there will be relatively few of these people among the new enrollees. As a result, the overall federal share of the expansion cost will be somewhere between 92 and 95 percent from 2014 through 2019. Although Medicaid enrollment nationally is estimated to increase by 27 percent by 2019, state spending will increase only 1.4 percent, on average, and federal spending will increase by 22 percent, the report finds. States have widely varying eligibility levels for adults. In many Northeastern and Midwestern states, parents are covered to double the poverty level or above, whereas in others, such as Texas, Virginia and Missouri, only disabled or truly indigent adults _ those making less than $8,000 for a family of four _ are eligible. The widely varying status quo means that the impact of raising the eligibility threshold to a single national standard will have a disparate state-by-state impact. In the states that have invested the most heavily in expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, it will have relatively little impact. In New York, for example, the Medicaid population is expected to increase by only 6 percent by 2019, and the cost impact on the state is expected to be zero because the federal government will be paying the new 100 percent match rate for some of the adults that the state has been paying a large share for today. In states with slightly less generous current Medicaid eligibility standards, there will be a larger increase in new enrollees, but the increase in costs will be only slightly higher, the study predicts. New Jersey, for instance, is expected to see a 38 percent rise in Medicaid enrollment by 2019 and a 1.2 percent increase in state spending on Medicaid as a result; California is expected to see a 20 percent increase in enrollment and a 1.5 percent increase in state Medicaid costs. In the states that have had the most stringent eligibility rules, there will probably be a huge increase in enrollment _ a predicted 45 percent in Texas, where a quarter of the population is uninsured, and 37 percent in Alabama. But because of the very high federal match rate, the predicted increase in state Medicaid spending in these states will be small _ about 3 percent. Seen more broadly, the report finds, these states will be making out better than states with more expansive Medicaid eligibility today because a vast swath of their population will be covered at the 100 percent (and eventually 90 percent) federal match rate for newly eligible people, whereas most of the Medicaid population in the other states will be covered under their existing lower federal match rates. In Texas, for instance, the overall federal match rate for Medicaid will go up from 60 to 67 percent, but in New York it will remain at 50 percent. Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, said that states that will enjoy the very high federal match rate may be protesting nonetheless because they are worried that they will not be able to afford even their small share of the expansion _ and because they may be less committed to Medicaid generally. Someone offered a $200 pair of shoes for $20, he said, will appreciate that only if he likes the shoes _ and if he has $20. 'This is a pretty good deal,' for states, Weil said. But it's a question of whether 'states focus on what they're going to get versus whether they can afford this slightly smaller amount they have to put in.' The study used the same assumptions as the Congressional Budget Office for what the participation levels will be in the expanded Medicaid but also produced a second set of estimates assuming a higher participation, with Medicaid expanding by 22.8 million people, if outreach efforts and the goad of the individual insurance mandate succeed beyond expectations. Even under this higher enrollment, the increase in state Medicaid costs would be relatively small _ 3.4 percent in California and 5.1 percent in Texas. Kaiser officials dismissed predictions by some governors, such as Indiana's Mitch Daniels (R), that 100 percent of the newly eligible people would sign up, thereby resulting in much higher costs to states. History shows that large numbers of people eligible for Medicaid never bother to sign up, they said. 'The reality of the fiscal situation today at the state level is going to be the lens through which any state is going to assess the future,' Kaiser Executive Vice President Diane Rowland said. But, she added, 'if you want to make assumptions like 100 percent of people signing up, that doesn't bear out any experience we've had.' "
1,"Flan and Ouisa Kittredge sell art. They believe all their problems will be over if they can clinch a deal on a Cezanne. They find, like many who have been dealing in paintings recently, that their problems are just beginning. This is the plot of John Guare's 1990 play 'Six Degrees of Separation,' the subject of a superb revival at London's Old Vic. Guare paints an icy- affectionate portrait of a middle-class art bubble. It feels contemporary, even 20 years on. The Kittredges's plush life changes when the dashing young Paul is brought into their New York apartment as a victim of mugging. He tells them he's a friend of their children and didn't know where else to turn. Paul is a great cook, an engaging conversationalist, and a beautifully mannered guest. He's also a brilliant con artist. Suddenly the play begins, with exuberant intellectual comedy, to double-deal in the real and the fake. The Kittredges must question the value of everything in their lives, from their rare double-sided Kandinsky to their children's love. At one point Paul delivers a beautiful hymn to the power of the imagination: His self-reinvention from black hustler to suave conman is seen in artistic terms. Later, it's clear that he understands the value of the imagination, not its cost. Value, cost. Cost, value. Guare suggests that there are no easy answers to this riddle, either in art or life. The performances fizz with energy. Anthony Head gives an intriguing edge to the suave Flan Kittredge, and Zoe Boyle and Paul Stocker are amusingly hysterical as his adolescent children. The play's weight comes from the relationship that develops between Ouisa Kittredge (Lesley Manville) and Paul (Obi Abili), who achieve a touching vulnerability. It's funny, it's moving, and ideas fly out like sparks from a whetstone. And all in 90 whirling minutes. A theatrical device that Guare uses cleverly is the direct-to-audience address. So does Douglas Carter Beane in 'The Little Dog Laughed,' with less sophistication. That's not to say that there aren't some whip-smart laughs in his comedy. 'You want my word?' shrieks the bitchy Hollywood agent Diane (Tamsin Greig). 'You're asking a whore for her cherry.' Diane's top client is the young star Mitchell Green (Rupert Friend) who has, as she says, a 'slight recurring case of homosexuality.' When Mitchell gets involved with a bisexual call-boy called Alex, Diane must nip the relationship in the bud to protect his burning-hot image in Hollywood. As a satire, it lacks bite. A leading man can't be 'out' in Hollywood? That's hardly a new plot line. As a comedy, it fares better, especially with Greig's hilarious performance. When Mitchell wonders if he can be an 'out' leading man, Diane shouts incredulously: 'Are you British? Do you have a knighthood? Then no!' Jamie Lloyd's simple production is serviceable, if lacking the elegant tension of 'Six Degrees.' Some scenes meander. The emotions verge on the trivial. There are no ideas about value, cost or imagination sparking off the whetstone here. With Greig's comic bravura, though, it has enough laughs to remain entertaining. _ 'Six Degrees of Separation,' through April 3 at the Old Vic theater; information: www.oldvictheatre.com, 44-844-871-7628. _ 'The Little Dog Laughed,' through April 10 at the Garrick Theatre; www.nimaxtheatres.com, 44-844-579-1974.

1,"Aksel Lund Svindal has some unfinished business to take care of in the men's Olympic downhill on Whistler Mountain. The Norwegian is drawing extra motivation from a couple of setbacks from last season as he prepares for the signature Alpine event of the Vancouver Games on Feb. 13. Bad weather conditions robbed him of a sporting chance to win the downhill at last year's world championships, and Svindal is still a bit peeved about being barred by Canadian officials from inspecting the Olympic course during a visit last spring. Not that the two-time overall World Cup champion needs extra reasons for craving his first Olympic gold. 'The downhill is special,' the 27-year-old Svindal said in a recent interview. 'I hope we get good, fair conditions and a tight race.' Svindal has bad memories of the world championship downhill last February when he and fellow former winners Bode Miller and Michael Walchhofer had to race in a soup of fog pouring across Val d'Isere, France. Unable to pick the fastest race line in the worsening light, the trio trailed well over one second behind Canada's John Kucera who went earlier in bright sunshine. 'I was kind of mad because the downhill was not fair at all,' said Svindal, who proved his point two days later when he and Miller returned to the hill and were easily fastest in the opening run of the super-combined event. 'We did the super-combined downhill in equal conditions and we were 1-2, like a second ahead of the guy who was third,' Svindal said. 'But that's all history. And I'm not complaining because I feel like I've had a good couple of years so far.' Indeed, Svindal took gold in that super-combi and carried over his form to win his second overall World Cup title. However, being crowned the world's best skier didn't get him access to the Olympic course when he visited Whistler last spring. The reconnaissance trip was important because he missed the World Cup races there the previous year after a horrific training crash three months earlier in Beaver Creek, Colorado, wiped out his season when defending his first overall title. 'I was supposed to train with the Canadian guys,' Svindal recalled. 'But then some, like, big dude from VANOC, the organizing committee, told the coaches that they do a lot of funding for the training and that I wasn't allowed to be on the slope. 'I thought it was ridiculous but, whatever.' In 1994, the young Aksel from Skedsmo, Norway, had easier access to the Olympic piste at nearby Lillehammer to watch Tommy Moe of the United States win downhill gold, 0.04 seconds ahead of home hero Kjetil Andre Aamodt. 'I was there, 11 years old and it was cool and everything but I hadn't really got my head around what it was,' Svindal said. He went to Turin 12 years later as a teammate of Aamodt, who at 34 won the super-G for the last of his record four Olympic golds in men's Alpine races. Even then, Svindal -- who was 21st in the downhill -- did not fully appreciate the moment because he was caught up in a breakout World Cup season. 'I felt like every race was important,' he said. 'This year I'm more aware what the Olympics really is, that it's something huge.' His focus on Whistler could sharpen with the World Cup likely out of reach. Offseason shoulder surgery was followed by a left knee injury in October and a lengthy bout of flu over the holidays. 'It's been a little different season than I hoped for,' he said. With hindsight, he would have skipped the season-opening giant slalom at Soelden, Austria, because his knee was worse than feared. After that, Svindal recuperated in Miami far away from snow and anything resembling winter. 'I needed to get out there,' he said. Then a sore throat on his flight back to Europe developed into strength-sapping flu after a troubled journey from Oslo to Italy for the downhill at Bormio. 'It took 17 hours to get there,' Svindal said. 'So I was like, 'I'm going to ski this thing.' That was a mistake.' After a so-so weekend in Wengen, Switzerland, Svindal now seeks his speed and rhythm on the intimidating Streif slope at Kitzbuehel, Austria. He believes he has time to peak when the Olympic fun begins. 'I'm looking forward to the whole experience,' he said. 'Just driving into Whistler and North Vancouver and feeling the Olympics spirit, seeing the rings, yeah, the whole deal. 'It's pretty unique.' "
1,"Toyota may have a tough time defending itself in lawsuits over flaws in its vehicles after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood found the company 'knowingly hid a dangerous defect.' The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Monday proposed a record civil penalty of $16.4 million, less than 2 percent of Toyota's projected net profit for the year ending March 31, related to a January recall of 2.3 million U.S. autos for accelerator pedals that allegedly stick. Toyota failed to act in a timely manner after knowing of the problem since at least September 2009, LaHood said. The NHTSA finding is useful for plaintiffs in lawsuits even if it won't be admitted as evidence in trials, said Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law. 'It's something that plaintiffs' lawyers can capitalize on in settlement negotiations or in asking judges for broader discovery,' Tobias said. In seeking company documents, 'they could point to the government's finding,' he said. A Toyota spokeswoman, Martha Voss, declined to comment Tuesday. 'We have already taken a number of important steps to improve our communications with regulators and customers on safety-related matters as part of our strengthened overall commitment to quality assurance,' the company said Monday in a statement. 'These include the appointment of a new Chief Quality Officer for North America and a greater role for the region in making safety-related decisions.' Toyota faces at least 177 suits seeking class-action, or group, status and at least 56 individual suits over sudden acceleration. The assessment by LaHood and NHTSA won't be admitted directly as evidence in trials against the company, said W. Mark Lanier, a Houston attorney who has filed class-action and individual lawsuits related to the claims. 'It's not like a criminal finding in that there was due process,' Lanier said. 'The underlying facts that prompted the fine will come into evidence.' The proposed fine may be admitted to rebut any assertions by Toyota that the government never found anything wrong with its vehicles, Lanier said. It won't be allowed in a personal-injury suit because it's irrelevant to the cause of a particular accident, he said. LaHood's evaluation that Toyota hid a defect would be admissible in lawsuits brought by investors claiming the carmaker failed to disclose material information, driving down the value of company shares, the lawyer said. The class actions typically include claims that Toyota deceived consumers by withholding information about problems that could cause sudden acceleration or misrepresenting the safety of the vehicles. Most allege fraud or deceptive trade practices. Some suits include claims of violations of civil racketeering law through 'failures to disclose and misrepresentations that their cars were safe,' said Ohio attorney Robert Steinberg of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley in Cincinnati. The NHTSA finding supports 'our RICO claim of mail and wire fraud based on Toyota's misrepresentations,' he said, referring to the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 'We think the misrepresentations also include statements that were limited to floor mats or sticking pedals' as causes of sudden acceleration, Steinberg said. More than half of the lawsuits contend that such incidents may be caused by a flaw in the electronic throttle control in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. The proposed fine 'certainly bolsters our cases,' said Robert Nelson of San Francisco-based Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which has filed 20 suits for individuals claiming injuries or deaths caused by sudden-acceleration incidents. 'It demonstrates Toyota has been less than forthright with the U.S. government and with consumers.' The proposed penalty came after Toyota, the world's largest automaker, last week reported U.S. sales rose 41 percent in March with the help of no-interest loans and discount leases, a sign that it was winning back some consumers after recalling more than 8 million vehicles worldwide. The Japanese automaker waited at least four months before telling the agency that accelerator pedals might stick, LaHood said Monday in a statement. Companies have five business days to report safety defects, the agency said. 'We now have proof that Toyota failed to live up to its legal obligations,' LaHood said. 'Worse yet, they knowingly hid a dangerous defect for months from U.S. officials and did not take action to protect millions of drivers and their families.' The $16.4 million fine is the largest that could legally be assessed against Toyota. The carmaker will probably concede to pay the fine, Kyodo News reported today, citing people familiar with the matter. In February, Toyota forecast a return to annual profit and a 51 percent surge in North American sales even as the company faces its worst recall crisis. The company expects net income of $880 million in the year ending March 31, compared with an earlier forecast for a 200 billion yen loss, it said Feb. 4 in a statement in Tokyo. The proposed fine is too little to harm the company financially, Lanier said. 'What we'll be trying to do is assess a real fine' through jury trials, he said. The lawyer has filed two personal injury cases and is considering filing about 100 others, including a dozen involving deaths, he said. "
1,"Bayer Leverkusen will spend the winter break at the top of the Bundesliga after a 3-2 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, while Bayern Munich kept pace with another attacking display. Eren Derdiyok found the net and Toni Kroos scored his second goal of the game as Leverkusen fought back from 2-1 down at home to capture the symbolic title of 'autumn champion' with 35 points from 17 matches. 'It was important for us that we turned around the game. We started well and gave up the lead. I don't know why. But the reaction by the team after falling behind was good,' said Kroos. Leverkusen coach Jupp Heynckes was happy that his team had the character to fight back and earn the win. 'These kinds of games show what kind of character this team has. It showed that we can work hard when trailing and win a game. It was enormously important that we wanted to win and stay top of the league,' Heynckes said. Bayern Munich collected its sixth straight victory and fourth in the Bundesliga with a 5-2 thrashing at home of last place Hertha Berlin to move on to 33 points in third place. Daniel van Buyten, Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben scored to give Bayern a 3-0 lead after just 33 minutes before Thomas Mueller made it 4-0 on the hour mark. Adrian Ramos and Raffael scored for Hertha, either side of a goal by Ivica Olic. 'Coming into the season we had a lot of new players and a new coach and a new system. But we are finding our rhythm and it's fun right now,' said Bayern playmaker Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has helped Bayern score 19 goals in its last five games. Fourth-place Borussia Dortmund celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the club with a 1-0 victory at home over Freiburg. Lucas Barrios scored the winner after 19 minutes, his ninth goal in the last 10 games. Champions Wolfsburg continued to struggle, drawing 2-2 at Eintracht Frankfurt to leave Armin Veh's team in eighth place with 24 points. Jan Schlaudraff ended a 13-month scoring drought by scoring twice to give Hannover a 2-0 lead over Bochum, only for his side to end up losing 3-2. Stuttgart snapped a nine-game winless streak in the Bundesliga with a comfortable 3-1 victory over 10-man Hoffenheim. Stuttgart scored three goals, two after Hoffenheim's Luiz Gustavo was dismissed for a second yellow card offense in the 52nd minute. It was new Stuttgart coach Christian Gross's first Bundesliga victory. After Sunday's games, the Bundesliga will have a break until Jan. 15. "
1,"The Bank of Japan may have fired the first shot in a new round of central bank action to prop up the global economy as recoveries in industrial nations falter. The unexpected decision by the Japanese central bank Tuesday to drop its interest rate to 'virtually zero' and expand its balance sheet comes as Federal Reserve policy makers move toward more unconventional easing. Bank of England officials will consider further stimulus Thursday, while the central banks of Australia, Canada and New Zealand are among those now holding fire on further interest-rate increases. The renewed push toward easier monetary policy comes as the International Monetary Fund warns growth in advanced economies is falling short of its forecasts ahead of its annual meetings in Washington this week. The dilemma for policy makers is that their actions may do little to revive growth and end up roiling currency markets. 'The Bank of Japan is at the head of the pack,' said Stewart Robertson, an economist at Aviva Investors in London, which manages about $370 billion in assets. 'It looks like a lot of others will follow. Whether it's right or not is another matter.' The Bank of Japan cut its overnight call rate target from 0.1 percent and established a $60 billion)fund to buy government bonds and other assets. It moved as the yen's surge to a 15-year high last month hurts exports and damps economic growth. The yen traded at 83.27 per dollar Tuesday, close to a Sept. 15 record of 82.88. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa may not be alone for long in taking action and Daiwa Institute of Research argues he's now engaged in a 'vicious spiral' of monetary easing with the Fed as both compete to bolster their economies. 'The BOJ's next moves will depend on the Fed,' said Maiko Noguchi, an economist at Daiwa in Tokyo. 'The bank will have no choice but steadily take easing measures.' Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues have signaled they may announce the purchase of more Treasuries as soon as their next policy meeting on Nov. 2-3 in an effort to boost growth and reduce an unemployment rate stuck near 10 percent for the past year. Bernanke said on Oct. 4 that the Fed had aided the economy by buying $1.75 trillion of mortgage debt and Treasuries from August 2008 through March 2010. Pacific Investment Management Co. says a new round of quantitative easing, the policy of creating money by enlarging the central bank's balance sheet, is 'likely.' 'The bottom line for the U.S. is a growth trajectory so slow you'd nearly call it stalled,' Paul McCulley, a portfolio investor at Pimco wrote on the company's website this week. Steven Englander, New York-based head of Group of 10 currency strategy at CitiGroup, said he anticipates the dollar will continue to fall, with the euro likely to pass through $1.40 from $1.37 Tuesday. The dollar has already dropped 7 percent against the euro since the start of September. At the Bank of England, policy maker Adam Posen made the strongest call yet on Sept. 28 for the British central bank to resume asset purchases after keeping its bond-buying program at $317 billion for the past 11 months. That proposal lays the ground for the first three-way split when the Monetary Policy Committee meets Thursday, with member Andrew Sentance advocating higher interest rates. 'At the present time, the growth threat is more of a danger than inflation,' said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, a London-based business lobby group. 'Yes, inflation is above target now. But a double-dip recession would raise the specter of deflation.' The revival of quantitative easing is a reversal from earlier this year, when central banks were halting stimulus or debating how to tighten policy. What's changed is the loss of momentum in industrial economies. John Lipsky, the IMF's No. 2 official, said that global growth in the second half of the year will fall short of the fund's 3.75 percent forecast. The Washington-based lender revises its outlook Wednesday. The question for those central banks leaning toward buying more assets is whether doing so will actually bolster expansion, said Charles Dumas, director of international research at Lombard Street Research, a London-based consultancy. 'Is quantitative easing going to cause people to spend more? I don't think so,' he said. 'It does add value in reducing the risk of a downward spiral in markets.' Another risk is that the use of unconventional monetary policy is viewed as an effort to weaken currencies to boost exports, rising competitive devaluations and protectionist responses, said Eric Chaney, chief economist at AXA Group in Paris. Japan, Switzerland and Brazil are among the countries that have already intervened in markets to restrain their exchange rates. 'This is close to a currency war,' said Chaney, a former official at the French France Ministry. 'It's not through exchange-rate manipulation, but through monetary policies.' "
1,"U.S. auto sales in September may have accelerated to the fastest rate since the federal government's 'cash for clunkers' incentive program last year as deliveries rose at the top seven sellers of vehicles in the nation. General Motors said Friday that industrywide U.S. sales in September may have increased to a rate of 12 million a year, and Chrysler said they gained to 11.9 million. Ford Motor Co. said deliveries were in the 'upper 11 million range.' The month's stronger sales are a sign that the car market and the broader economy may have bottomed out and that a slow, stable recovery is under way, said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends for Santa Monica, Calif.-based TrueCar.com. Toprak said deliveries may have reached 11.9 million, up from his earlier estimate of 11.6 million. 'It's slightly better than expected, but it's still a stable and painful growth process,' Toprak said in an interview. 'This is another step in a healthy but rather slow recovery. This month, there were no outside forces at play, like government program or crazy incentives, just the marketplace trying to recover on its own.' Deliveries at GM, the largest U.S. automaker, climbed 11 percent from a year earlier to 173,155, the Detroit-based company said in a statement Friday. Ford, the second-largest, increased sales 41 percent to 160,873, the Dearborn, Mich.- based company said in a statement. Industrywide deliveries in September were expected to reach an 11.7 million rate, the average of nine analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would top the 9.4 million pace of last September, the month after 'cash for clunkers' ended. Deliveries in all 2009 were 10.4 million, the lowest since 1982. The stronger month doesn't indicate renewed economic growth, just that the economy has avoided a double-dip recession, said John Canally, an economist and investment strategist at Boston-based LPL Financial Corp., which oversees $276.9 billion in assets. 'We probably have put a floor under vehicle sales, but the sparks you need to reaccelerate aren't quite there yet,' Canally said in an interview. 'You don't have robust job growth or robust income growth. Your traditional catalysts for strong consumer spending just aren't in place yet.' GM's deliveries trailed three analysts' average estimate for a 13 percent gain. Chevrolet brand sales rose 18 percent to 121,479, helped by the Silverado pickup and Equinox SUV. Buick deliveries gained 36 percent to 12,875, aided by the LaCrosse sedan. GMC increased 42 percent to 25,995, and Cadillac rose 11 percent to 12,620. 'Consumers are willing to spend, albeit cautiously,' Don Johnson, GM's vice president of U.S. sales, said Friday on a conference call with analysts. The industrywide selling rate for the month may be 12 million, he said. GM's sales of the Hummer, Pontiac, Saturn brands, which were closed, and the Saab brand that it sold, fell to 186 vehicles from 14,982 vehicles in September 2009. GM's four remaining U.S. brands _ Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick _ rose a combined 22 percent in September. Ford's results topped six analysts' average estimate for a 40 percent gain. The company's namesake brand deliveries increased 49 percent to 147,057 vehicles, while Lincoln gained 26 percent to 7,510 and the Mercury line, which is being discontinued, rose 16 percent to 6,306. Excluding the Volvo line, which Ford sold to China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., sales rose 46 percent. Chrysler sales increased 61 percent to 100,077, the Auburn Hills, Mich.-based company said in a statement. That topped the 48 percent average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Deliveries of its namesake brand rose 92 percent to 17,348, helped by the Town & Country minivan and Sebring sedan. The Dodge brand increased 71 percent to 36,272, Jeep rose 65 percent to 28,603, and Ram gained 22 percent to 17,854. 'Chrysler is benefitting from stable gas prices and the highly visible launch of the redesigned Grand Cherokee,' Ivan Drury, an analyst for Santa Monica, Calif.-based Edmunds.com, said in an e-mailed statement Friday. 'As long as consumers are not worried about high fuel costs Chrysler should be able to maintain a decent sales pace, since 71 percent of Chrysler sales are trucks.' 'We believe the economic recovery in the second half will be slower than the first half,' GM's Johnson said. 'We do expect modest employment growth. Consumers are starting to spend, albeit cautiously.' Toyota, the world's largest automaker, sold 147,162 Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles in September, 17 percent more than a year ago, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The automaker's deliveries were expected to gain 21 percent, the average estimate of four analysts. Honda, the second-largest Japanese carmaker, sold 97,361 Honda and Acura vehicles last month, up 26 percent from a year ago, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The average of four analysts' estimates was for 32 percent increase. Nissan, Japan's third-largest automaker, sold 74,205 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles last month, up 34 percent from a year earlier, Al Castignetti, vice president of U.S. sales, said in an interview. Car deliveries expanded 36 percent, led by a 65 percent jump for Altima sedans, he said. 'This year has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride,' Castignetti said. Sales should keep improving for the rest of 2010, particularly as light-truck demand remains strong, he said. Nissan was expected to boost sales 30 percent, the average estimate of four analysts. Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest automaker, boosted sales 48 percent to 46,556 last month, led by increased deliveries of Sonata sedans and Tucson sport-utility vehicle. Retail sales to individual drivers, excluding those to rental companies and business fleets, surged 73 percent, Hyundai's U.S. unit said. _ With assistance from Alan Ohnsman in Los Angeles, Craig Trudell in Southfield, Mich., and Courtney Schlisserman in Washington.

1,"A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a courthouse in northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, killing 19 people in the latest attack in an onslaught by Islamist militants retaliating against an army offensive near the Afghan border. The bombing was the seventh militant strike in less than two weeks in and around Peshawar, the largest city in the northwest. The attacks have killed more than 80 people. The bomber, who arrived in a taxi, was being searched by police officers at the gate of the city's lower court when he detonated explosives on his body, government official Sahibzada Anees said. Several damaged motorbikes were strewn about the site, on the main Khyber Road, and firefighters sprayed water on a charred, smoking white car. Dr. Saib Gul of the city's Lady Reading Hospital said 19 people, including three policemen, were killed and 51 were wounded. 'These attacks will not deter us in our fight against these beasts who are killing our children,' said Bashir Ahmad Bilour, senior minister of the North West Frontier Province. The army launched its offensive against the Pakistani Taliban in South Waziristan in mid-October. It has retaken many towns in the region, but the militants say they avoided fighting and will now begin a guerrilla campaign. The United States has welcomed the offensive, but wants the army to do more against the insurgents in the border area blamed for violence across the border in Afghanistan. Abdul Aziz, a restaurant owner in Peshawar, said business was down because of the rash of attacks but he expressed solidarity with the government's efforts. 'Today Peshawar is like a fort under attack ... each and every road and street of the city is barricaded and there's no more hustle-bustle at the bazaar,' he said. 'But after all these sacrifices, we want the government to end this menace of terrorism once and for all.' Pakistan officials flagged the offensive in South Waziristan several months before it actually began, which Bilour said allowed the militants to escape and plan the current wave of terror. 'Unfortunately the announcement of the operation in Waziristan prior to the actual operation caused this problem,' he said. 'They (the militants) are hiding in villages surrounding Peshawar and make their way in despite security.' Since the beginning of October, more than 300 people have been killed in bombings and militant raids on government, civilian and Western targets in the country, most of them in the northwest. Still, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani insisted most militant commanders were either killed or on the run. 'They are using the weapons they have scattered here and there,' he said. 'God willing, it will take some time, but I assure you things will return to normal soon.' The bomb explosion occurred hours after missiles fired from a suspected U.S. drone killed three suspected militants in Shana Khuwara village in North Waziristan, another region close to the Afghan border region where al-Qaida and Taliban hold sway. The missiles hit a house owned by a local tribesman just after midnight, two intelligence officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Ahmed Noor Wazir, who witnessed the attack, said rescuers pulled three dead bodies and four badly wounded men from the rubble of the house, which was being used by Taliban militants. Shana Khuwara village is not far from the border with South Waziristan. Many militants are believed to have fled to North Waziristan to escape the fighting, which killed seven insurgents in the past 24 hours, the army said in a statement Thursday. The suspected drone strike was the third since Pakistan launched the offensive in mid-October. The pace of the attacks has slowed since the operation began, possibly to avoid the perception that the U.S. is aiding the Pakistani army with the strikes. Anti-American sentiment is pervasive throughout Pakistan, and the drone strikes are unpopular because they often kill innocent civilians. U.S. officials rarely discuss the missile strikes, and although Pakistan's government publicly condemns them as violations of its sovereignty, many analysts believe the two countries have a secret deal allowing them. ------ Associated Press writers Rasool Dawar in Mir Ali and Anwarullah Khan in Khar contributed to this report.

1,"A crew of suicide bombers attacked a central commercial area dotted with guesthouses frequented by foreigners, setting off an hours-long gun battle with Afghan police early Friday and killing at least 17 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the dramatic raid, which began around daybreak and wounded at least 32 people. The assault was the latest in a string of attacks to rock the capital city, whose residents generally feel a world away from the raging rural insurgency that U.S.-led forces are seeking to contain in a new push in southern Afghanistan. The attack began with a car bombing that left a swimming pool-sized crater outside a small hotel, where most guests were Indian, said Abdul Ghafar Sayed Zada, head of criminal investigations for the city police. Three suicide bombers then entered another nearby guesthouse, the Park Residence, which is often used by Americans. There, two bombers detonated their explosives, while a third holed up as green- uniformed Afghan security forces descended and a firefight ensued. The final bomber was killed by police about four hours after the attack began, authorities said. After the standoff ended, police carried out bodies swathed in floral blankets from the Park Residence, their boots crunching layers of shattered window glass that lay underfoot. At least three police officers were killed, Zada said. Among the dead civilians were Italians and several Indians, he said. Friday's attack further eroded the sense of security in the capital, challenging the government of President Hamid Karzai. It came about five weeks after a similar commando-style assault on a shopping center near the presidential palace and a large hotel. 'If we have security, why do we have this kind of drama?' asked Ahmad Haji Zada, 22, who came to survey the damage to his mangled building-parts store, about a block from the hotels. 'How is it possible for them to get into the city?' In the surrounding area, the bombs had laid waste to signs of peaceful pursuits in the long-embattled city. A microfinance bank was partially crumbled. Layered wedding cakes were jumbled inside a glass case in a bakery, their vibrant flowers smashed and blurred. As Zada spoke, a sporadic firefight was still in progress inside the Park Residence, and occasional booms shook the ground. Police helicopters hovered overhead, surveying what was, even at the height of the gun battles, a fairly calm scene. It was Friday morning, the beginning of the Afghan weekend, and the streets were mostly empty. 'The sound was a very, very terrible sound,' said an employee of a nearby cellphone company, pointing up at the empty window panes of his office. He said he and two Pakistani guests, who had spent the night at the office, were spared injury from flying glass because they were sleeping under heavy blankets. Despite the Taliban claim of responsibility, the timing of the attack {ndash} when few passersby were present {ndash} sparked speculation among witnesses and authorities at the bomb site. One Afghan intelligence officer at the scene, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one of the bombers entered the first guesthouse after the car bomb exploded outside and shot two Indian guests. The intelligence officer blamed today's attack on Pakistan's intelligence agency, which U.S. officials have accused of collaborating with Afghan militants in a 2008 bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul. India is Pakistan's archenemy, and Pakistan strongly opposes its rising influence in Afghanistan. Many witnesses, however, simply seemed bewildered. Men in turbans rummaged through blackened wreckage, laying the boots and jackets of dead security guards in a muddy pile. 'I have spent all my 22 years in fighting and this kind of explosions,' said Zada, the shopkeeper. 'It will be like this forever.' Special correspondent Javed Hamdard contributed to this report. "
1,"As the Coast Guard searched for 11 crew members missing after a drilling rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico, authorities turned their focus to controlling an oil spill that could threaten the fragile ecosystem of the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts. The Deepwater Horizon had burned violently for nearly two days until it sank Thursday morning. The fire's out, but as much as 336,000 gallons (1.27 million liters) of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) below, officials said. 'If it gets landward, it could be a disaster in the making,' said Cynthia Sarthou, executive director for the environmental group Gulf Restoration Network. BP PLC, which leased the rig and took the lead in the cleanup, said Friday it has 'activated an extensive oil spill response,' including using remotely operated vehicles to assess the subsea well and 32 vessels to mop up the spill. BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company will do 'everything in our power to contain this oil spill and resolve the situation as rapidly, safely and effectively as possible.' He says the company can call on more resources if needed. Ed Overton, a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor, said he expects some of the light crude oil to evaporate while much of it turns into a pasty mess called a 'chocolate mousse' that ultimately breaks apart into 'tar balls,' small chunks of oily residue that can wash ashore. 'It's going to be a god-awful mess for a while,' he said. 'I'm not crying doomsday or saying the sky is falling, but that is the potential.' The Coast Guard early Friday was searching for the missing, but some family members said they had been told that officials assumed all were dead. Most of the crew -- 111 members -- were ashore, including 17 taken to hospitals. Four were in critical condition. The accident shows that drilling is not safe, said Abe Powell, who heads Get Oil Out!, created after a 1969 platform accident off Santa Barbara, California, fouled miles of ocean and beaches with wildlife-killing goo and spawned the environmental movement. 'When oil companies say drilling is safe now and we won't allow any accidents ... we know that's not true,' he said. Weather forecasts indicate the spill was likely to stay well away from shore at least through the weekend, but if winds change it could come ashore more rapidly, said Doug Helton of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's office of response and restoration. The Coast Guard, which was leading the investigation, hadn't given up the search early Friday for those missing from the rig, which went up in flames Tuesday night about 41 miles (66 kilometers) from the mouth of the Mississippi River. Four who made it off safely were still on a boat operating one of several underwater robots being used to assess whether the flow of oil could be shut off at a control valve on the sea floor, said Guy Cantwell, spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. The Marine Spill Response Corp., an energy industry cleanup consortium, brought seven skimmer boats to suck oily water from the surface, four planes that can scatter chemicals to disperse oil, and 94.6 miles (152 kilometers) of containment boom, a floating barrier with a skirt that drapes down under the water and corrals the oil. Another 500,000 feet (152,400 meters) of boom were on the way, BP spokesman Tom Mueller. 'Right now we are over-responding with resources to manage the potential spill here,' he said. 'We will be well-prepared to manage whatever comes.' He said about 1.1 mile (1.8 kilometer) of boom was in the water by Thursday evening. Family members of two missing workers filed separate lawsuits Thursday accusing Transocean and BP of negligence. Both companies declined to comment about legal action against them after the first suit was filed. The U.S. Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil rigs, conducted three routine inspections of the Deepwater Horizon this year -- in February, March and on April 1 -- and found no violations, MMS spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said. ------ Associated Press Writer Noaki Schwartz reported from Los Angeles, Holbrook Mohr from Jackson, Mississippi, Mike Kunzelman, Cain Burdeau and Alan Sayre in Louisiana, Chris Kahn in New York and Sofia Mannos of AP Television News contributed to this report.

1,"President Obama's push to deploy body-imaging scanners at airports worldwide will cost U.S. taxpayers roughly $3 billion over eight years, congressional investigators report, but it is unclear that the controversial devices would have caught an alleged al-Qaida terrorist who tried to blow up a Detroit-bound jetliner with explosives hidden in his underwear. The administration has cited the Christmas day attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in pushing to double its planned deployment, to 1,800 scanners, at U.S. airports by 2014, and to encourage foreign governments to use the same new technologies at airports that send flights to the United States. The benefits and limitations of the machines will be discussed Wednesday afternoon at a hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee. 'In the never-ending race to protect our country, we have to stay one step ahead of a nimble adversary. That's what these steps are designed to do,' Obama said Jan. 8 in announcing increased aviation security and screening measures. The machines create images outlining the unclothed human body by bouncing X-rays or radio waves off skin or concealed objects. However, security experts say the 'advanced imaging technology' has limits: 'Backscatter' rays can be obscured by body parts, might not readily detect thin items seen 'edge-on' or objects hidden inside the body, and require a human operator to decide whether to conduct additional questioning or a physical search. 'While officials said (the scanners) performed as well as physical pat downs in operational tests, it remains unclear whether the AIT would have detected the weapon used in the December 2009 incident,' the Government Accountability Office, Congress's audit arm, said in testimony prepared for the hearing. Abdulmutallab allegedly concealed 80 grams of explosive powder in a pouch sewn into his underwear. GAO official Steve Lord is expected to tell the committee that investigators are still reviewing TSA operational tests conducted at the end of last year. 'While GAO recognizes that TSA is attempting to address a vulnerability exposed by the December 2009 attempted attack, a cost-benefit analysis is important as it would help inform TSA's judgment about the optimal deployment strategy for the AITs, and how best to address this vulnerability,' the prepared testimony states. The audit agency said TSA estimates each unit costs about $170,000, meaning it would cost about $300 million to buy 1,800 units, enough to cover about 60 percent of screening checkpoint lanes at the highest-priority commercial airports. Each scanner requires three people to operate. Based on the administration's request for $219 million to hire 3,550 TSA staffers next year alone, GAO estimates it will cost $2.4 billion overall to staff the machines over eight years. A TSA spokeswoman said the agency has already conducted a cost analysis and determined that scanners are better than existing alternatives, including metal detectors and machines that check swabs of people's hands or belongings for traces of explosives. As such, TSA said, the machines increase the odds that security officials can detect anomalies in a fraction of the time and inconvenience as pat-down searches. 'While there is no silver-bullet technology, AIT is very effective at detecting metallic and nonmetallic threats on passengers, including explosives,' TSA said in a statement. 'It's one part of our multi-layered strategy to minimize risk, deter future attacks and protect the traveling public.' 'There is, of course, no foolproof solution,' Obama said in January, saying only that the new scanners might have stopped Abdulmutallab. Privacy groups have opposed the machines, saying they amount to electronic strip searches whose images are prone to abuse. The Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safety, a group that includes the European Commission, International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization, suggested earlier this year in an internal report that, although the radiation dose from scanners is extremely small, pregnant women and children should not be subjected to scanning. Before the Dec. 25 attack, lawmakers in Europe and the United States previously voted last year to limit use of the scanners. "
1,"Even as the Pentagon's contentious pay-for-performance system fades away, it remains a hot button of controversy. The Defense Department is moving 226,000 civilian workers from the short-lived National Security Personnel System. Most will rejoin the familiar General Schedule that covers the bulk of federal employees. The transition is proceeding quickly. Seventy-five percent of those affected will be out of the NSPS by the end of September, long before the January 2012 deadline, John James, director of the transition office, told a Senate panel Wednesday. This may be the odd case of bureaucracy moving with too much speed, said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs federal workforce subcommittee. 'Take your time and do it right,' he told James. Under the law terminating the program, none of the workers will lose pay because of the transition. But perhaps as many as 50,000 whose NSPS salary is higher than that provided by their GS grade will get smaller raises than their colleagues, under a process known as 'pay retention.' They are not happy about that. 'If we are in fact faced with a situation where tens of thousands of employees are placed on retained pay, we believe you will be dealing with a disgruntled and demoralized workforce which has now been shifted in and out of different pay systems over the last three years,' Patricia Niehaus, president of the Federal Managers Association, told senators. On the other side of this situation are the majority of Defense Department employees who have been moved from the NSPS. They received a pay increase when they returned to the GS. 'Of the 53,057 employees that have been transitioned through the pay period that began on May 23, 2010, approximately 71 percent received a pay increase, with the average salary `bump' of $1,363 per year; and 8 percent remained at their same rate of pay because their salary matched a step within their new GS grade,' James said. The rest, 21 percent of those already moved, are on pay retention. If that ratio holds, more than 47,000 workers would get 50 percent of salary increases available to other employees until their GS salary schedule matches their pay. 'In gradual increments, the pay schedule is catching up to the employee's salary,' James said. When it does, 'pay retention ends, and the employee will begin to receive the full government pay increase.' The Federal Managers Association decries that predicament, particularly for older workers whose retirement income will be based on their pay while working. But the American Federation of Government Employees isn't so upset. 'Although we do not wish to see any employees disadvantaged by their conversion out of NSPS, I think it's important to put this situation into perspective,' Patricia Viers, president of AFGE Local 1148, told the Senate panel. Employees on pay retention 'already got what could be considered an early raise and have benefited from being at these higher pay levels for some length of time.' It is somewhat unusual for a union to offer something less than a full-throated advocacy for every penny workers could be entitled to. Before the transition started, AFGE represented about 668 NSPS staff members, according to Defense Department figures. A larger problem involving NSPS pay is the racial and class discrimination that Viers said an internal Pentagon evaluation found last year. 'Being black had a more negative effect than membership in other racial groups,' she said. 'So we know that a significant number of good employees lost money under NSPS.' Also, lower-wage workers were less likely to get high performance ratings. The Bush administration once had high hopes that the NSPS would lead the way in replacing the GS system with one in which pay raises were based more on performance than longevity. But the NSPS never won the confidence of employees. Congress terminated it last year. 'Since its inception, NSPS was plagued by employee distrust and a lack of transparency,' said subcommittee Chairman Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii. 'As one of three senators to vote against NSPS in 2003, I was pleased that this system was repealed. Federal employees, especially those charged with defending our nation, are entitled to a personnel system that is fair and transparent.' "
1,"Cuba has freed one of the 54 political prisoners still behind bars following a state crackdown on dissent six years ago and also paroled a Spanish businessman awaiting trial for bribery, officials in Spain and a Cuban political opposition group said Tuesday. The moves appear to be gestures of goodwill on the heels of a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos -- though a top Cuban dissident accused Cuban leaders of using political prisoners as political bargaining chips. Nelson Alberto Aguiar Ramirez had been sentenced to 13 years in prison for treason, but he was released and picked up by his wife early Tuesday, according to Laura Pollan, a founding member of the 'Ladies in White' support group for the wives and relatives of those arrested during the 2003 crackdown. In Madrid, meanwhile, Spain's Foreign Ministry confirmed Cuban authorities freed Pedro Hermosilla, a Spanish businessman jailed about a month ago on charges of offering payoffs to officials. He will not be allowed to leave the country pending trial. Moratinos spent two days in Cuba and met for nearly three hours with President Raul Castro. He caused a stir by refusing to see dissidents, though Moratinos said that he broached the subject of human rights with Cuba's president and that Spain will continue to push the communist government on the issue after it assumes the revolving presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. Spain's foreign minister asked Castro about Hermosilla's case and his office said it considers the businessman's provisional release a positive gesture. Speaking to reporters upon his return to Spain, Moratinos said releasing the prisoners was 'a new example' of increasingly warm relations between his country and Cuba. Aguiar Ramirez and 74 other political opposition leaders, activists and independent journalists were arrested on charges of conspiring with Washington to topple Cuba's government, accusations both the U.S. and Cuban dissidents denied. The group was imprisoned in March 2003, just days after the U.S. led an invasion of Iraq and the world's attention focused on that war, a period Cuban dissidents call the 'Black Spring.' Aguiar Ramirez becomes the 22nd of the so-called 'Group of 75' to be freed. Others were granted conditional parole for health reasons, completed shorter sentences or were released into forced exile in Spain. Pollan said 'the Ladies in White are very happy Nelson was freed,' but that her group believes his release has more to do with political posturing than anything Moratinos said or did while in Cuba. 'I think we can't thank Moratinos, because this was definitely the Cuban government playing politics, offering gifts and trading our family members as if they were bargaining chips,' Pollan said. Pollan, whose husband Hector Maseda was sentenced to 20 years in prison, said 'the Cuban government has held our relatives hostage and made them coins to be traded.' The communist government severely limits freedom of speech and assembly and controls all newspapers, radio and television stations. Blogs critical of the state are often blocked and the government tolerates no official political opposition to its single-party system, though it allows some independent groups such as Havana's Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation to operate. That organization reported in August that Cuba is holding 206 political prisoners, a tally that included Aguiar Ramirez. Its director, Elizardo Sanchez, said by phone Tuesday that his country remains 'an enormous gulag.' "

1,"At last year's Sundance Film Festival, when the comedian-actress Mo'Nique was first seen as the shockingly violent mother in the drama 'Precious: Based on the Novel `Push' by Sapphire,' her performance immediately won praise as Oscar- worthy. But as 'Precious' made its way along the festival circuit, Mo'Nique was a no-show, choosing not to join co-stars Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz in promotional appearances. In November, on her late-night BET talk show, she dared to question, at a time when Hollywood marketing gurus have increasingly come to resemble campaign managers, why she should politic for an Oscar at all: 'The performance is on the screen! At what point am I still trying to prove something?' she said. When she later declined to attend the New York Film Critics Circle awards dinner, observers began wondering whether Mo'Nique was risking her chance at an Oscar. Since then, Mo'Nique (who grew up as Monique Imes in suburban Baltimore) has gone on to deliver heartfelt and humble remarks while picking up trophies for best supporting actress at the Broadcast Film Critics Association ceremony, the Golden Globes and SAG Awards. The actress now seems a shoo-in to be among the Academy Award nominees who will be announced Tuesday morning. And she seems to have grasped a fundamental film-world truth: The promotional is political. 'Only a fool would not recognize that there's a political process to Hollywood and to awards shows and to positioning and lobbying,' says Michael Levine, a veteran Hollywood publicist. 'You're naive to the point of foolishness if you don't recognize the political process. And I'll tell you who does recognize it: people who win.' If the big Oscars broadcast March 7 is akin to election night, the awards preceding it are the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses. Just as candidates in political primary season gather momentum and project inevitability, the four major acting awards appear to be, after many well-managed wins, locked-up: Jeff Bridges ('Crazy Heart') and Sandra Bullock ('The Blind Side') as favorites to win Best Actor and Actress, with Christoph Waltz ('Inglorious Basterds') and Mo'Nique as their counterparts in the supporting categories. Bullock clearly comprehends the red-carpet realpolitik. When she received a Critics' Choice award for best actress last month, sharing the honor with Meryl Streep, Bullock was visibly shocked. She engaged in a bit of feigned umbrage, planted a huge kiss on Streep's lips, and went on to say, 'It is a great honor to be in the company of the extraordinary women I was so lucky to be nominated with, because this one here inspired me to do everything better.' The kiss, which quickly went viral online, was admittedly a little out there. But by the time Bullock won the Golden Globe two days later, she was more composed, graciously thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for allowing her to 'go over to the other side' from comedy to drama, thanking 'The Blind Side's' director and crew (including the hair and make-up artists and costume designer), thanking her family _ in German and English, no less _ and finally, tearing up slightly, thanking her husband, whom she credited with making her work better in recent years. A week later, when Bullock won the Screen Actors Guild award, she greeted her audience with a combination of humor ('If this were only not televised, so I could use the appropriate words I'm feeling right now') and solemnity ('I am Sandra Bullock, and I am an actor'), before humbly admitting that she decided to stop working six years ago 'because I wasn't doing good work' and then thanking her fellow actors for allowing her 'to audition again.' (Although Oscar nominations were finalized on the same day as the SAG awards, the guild recognition will still count in March; actors make up the largest voting block of the Motion Picture Academy.) _ _ _ Much like political candidates subtly tweaking their stump speeches to appeal to whatever constituency they happen to be addressing, Bullock, Mo'Nique and their colleagues must be attuned to each audience as they run the awards gauntlet. 'If you're speaking at the Globes, you're speaking to the international audience,' said one studio publicist, who, like other Hollywood marketing specialists contacted for this article, declined to be identified in order to preserve relationships with his clients. 'With SAG, you're speaking to your fellow actors. With the Broadcast Film Critics, you're speaking to the critics. And if you're speaking to the Academy, you're speaking to the greater film community.' In every instance, this publicist said, nominees and winners should never forget that they're part of a marketing campaign for the movie that got them there: 'Staying on message is really key.' There have been some awkward trips to the Oscar podium in the past. Forest Whitaker was reportedly at a serious loss for words when he won the first of his awards for 'The Last King of Scotland' in 2006, thankfully at a ceremony in October that few people saw, at the Hollywood Film Festival. In time, Whitaker honed his acceptance remarks so that he was camera-ready the following February when he won the Best Actor Oscar. 'The first time is always like when you make a batch of pancakes and the first one is the test pancake,' said the studio publicist. 'You have to find out where you are, and then do what you need to do to just be prepared.' Marketing consultants who specialize in Oscar campaigns agree that, unless you're Helen Mirren, prepared remarks are the only way not to fumble and stumble, even if it means sticking to the same speech over and over again _ for example, Jamie Foxx's call-and-response 'Oooh, ahhh,' used as a lead-in when he won serial awards for 'Ray.' 'Most people can't wing it, and it's best to have a prepared speech,' said veteran awards consultant Tony Angellotti. ' `Don't go off the reservation' is the mantra.' For those who have wandered off, a quick recovery is key. When Kate Winslet delivered a flustered, hyperventilating acceptance speech at last year's Golden Globes for her double-win for 'Revolutionary Road' and 'The Reader,' many thought she overcompensated in an effort to appear un-entitled. She dialed the emotion back in subsequent speeches. (But even if she hadn't, one observer noted, 'the die was cast.' Indeed, it was: Winslet went on to win an Oscar for 'The Reader.') Jack Nicholson won a Golden Globe in 1998 for his performance in 'As Good as It Gets' and gave a gum-chewing, slightly sloppy speech that included a pants-on mooning of his fellow nominees. 'I remember thinking, `I wonder if Jack just hurt himself,' ' another publicist said. Sure enough, the next day, Nicholson unexpectedly showed up at the Broadcast Film Critics luncheon to receive his award for best actor. No mooning this time. _ _ _ For veterans like Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges, an Oscar campaign is as familiar as the Iowa State Fair is to Bill and Hillary Clinton. But for someone like Mo'Nique, who is not only an unknown quantity to many Academy voters but who must also prove that she is nothing like her monstrous character, the stakes are considerably higher. A newcomer who got high marks her first time out on the hustings was Jennifer Hudson, who was a mere 'American Idol' also-ran before delivering a revelatory supporting turn in the musical 'Dreamgirls.' When Hudson began gathering awards in 2006 and into 2007, said Oscar marketing specialist Cynthia Swartz, she came across as 'incredibly winning.' Those speeches, Swartz added, are 'the moments when you can see that person's real self. ... And when people are getting it out of the blue, it can be really charming.' Once an Oscar candidate has sewn up the base, reassured swing voters and avoided the Hollywood equivalent of Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley calling Curt Schilling a Yankees fan (like complimenting Martin Scorsese for 'Star Wars,' perhaps?), the campaign should end in an assured and confident victory speech. But then, a newly minted Oscar winner like Halle Barry signs on for a post-win come-down like 'Catwoman' or Nicolas Cage cashes in his Oscar miles on 'Con Air.' Such examples suggest that politicking is one thing, while governing _ at least one's own career _ is a different matter altogether. "
1,"Education Secretary Arne Duncan plans to announce Monday that his agency is ramping up enforcement of civil rights laws in schools and colleges, a move that seeks to draw a contrast with the policies of his Republican predecessors. In a speech drafted for an appearance at a civil rights landmark in Selma, Ala., Duncan said the department's Office for Civil Rights expects to issue a series of guidance letters to educators to address 'issues of fairness and equity.' He said the department will also announce in coming weeks and months several enforcement actions to ensure that students have equal access to a college-prep curriculum, advanced courses, and classes in math and science. 'The truth is that, in the last decade, the Office for Civil Rights has not been as vigilant as it should have been in combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities,' Duncan said in the draft speech. 'But that is about to change.' Duncan is expected to speak at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where civil rights marchers were beaten by state and local police in March 1965. A former senior education official in the George W. Bush administration disputed the suggestion that under Republican leadership the agency was not vigilant on civil rights. 'The Bush administration in the educational context had a very good record on civil rights,' said Stephanie Monroe, who was assistant education secretary for civil rights from 2006 to 2009. 'During the three years that I was there, I think we did quite a bit,' she added. Monroe said her office focused on swift responses to allegations of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, disability or age and initiated 'compliance reviews' in areas that had a significant volume of complaints. Disability rights enforcement emerged as a priority, she said. With about 600 employees and 12 field offices, the Office for Civil Rights is one of the largest units in the department. Its annual budget is $103 million. 'You adhere very much to the spirit and the letter of the law,' Monroe said. 'That should not depend on who is sitting on Pennsylvania Avenue. It should be consistent.' Monroe's successor is Russlynn Ali, who came to the Obama administration from the nonprofit organization Education Trust, which works on behalf of disadvantaged students. Ali said in an interview Friday that 'we are weaving equity into all that we do' and that her office would examine potential cases for evidence of discrimination through 'disparate impact' against certain classes of students on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex or disability. Ali said the department plans to initiate 38 compliance reviews this year. There were 29 initiated last year, she said, and 42 in 2008. But she said the depth of the reviews will be 'much greater than in the past.' "
1,"Oil prices hung below $79 a barrel Tuesday in Asia, giving back some gains as regional stock markets mostly fell and the dollar strengthened moderately. Benchmark crude for February delivery was down 11 cents to $78.66 a barrel at midday Bangkok time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract settled up 72 cents at $78.77 on Monday after surging above $79 as an extended cold snap in the U.S. triggered an end-of-year rally in energy futures. Futures contracts for oil, natural gas and heating oil have all become more expensive this month as snow storms blanketed parts of the U.S. and a sharp drop in supplies of crude and other fuels surprised traders. Analysts say oil could rise above $80 before the end of the year if U.S. inventories figures later this week show adrop in stockpiles, which would suggest improving demand in the world's largest economy. Providing a negative cue for oil in Asia was a mild sell-off in stock markets -- sometimes a barometer for oil traders of confidence in the economy -- and a stronger dollar. Oil, which is traded in dollars, often moves in the opposite direction to the currency. In other Nymex trading in January contracts, heating oil climbed 0.5 cents to $2.0788 gallon while gasoline added 0.2 cents to $2.02 a gallon. Natural gas fell by 2.5 cents to $5.965 per 1,000 cubic feet. In London, Brent crude for February delivery fell 4 cents to $77.32 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. "
1,"General Electric Co. met the objectives it set for the first year of its so- called healthymagination initiative, including spending $700 million on research and development as part of its plan to develop more efficient, lower-cost health-care treatments. GE, the world's biggest maker of medical-imaging equipment and health-care information-technology systems, will spend $6 billion by 2015 on products, financing and partnerships. Since announcing the plan a year ago, the company has started a $250 million equity fund targeting life-science and technology and introduced 24 new products, GE said in a statement. 'In terms of cost, quality and access, we're really on track,' Mike Barber, the executive who oversees the program, said in an interview. The six-year program, announced by Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt in May 2009, aims to spend $3 billion on research, honing its efforts toward products that cut procedure costs and detect diseases earlier; $1 billion on partnerships; and $2 billion through its finance unit, GE Capital. It also seeks to lower GE's expenses via a company-wide health program. New products have included the VScan, a hand-held ultrasound device, while the life-sciences and technology fund announced a $5 million investment last week in CardioDX Inc., a maker of non-invasive genomic tests. Partnerships include a home health-care venture with Intel Corp. As a next step, GE is leading an effort with the five largest employers in the Cincinnati area, home to the company's aviation unit, to pool resources in an effort to stem rising health-care costs. Immelt, 54, who has mentioned the fledgling effort in speeches this year, grew up in the area, which also has one of the biggest populations of GE employees and retirees in the U.S. 'We're talking with five of the largest employers in the Cincinnati area and we've gotten a positive response,' Barber said.

1,"Recently, I happened to hear the latest segment in NPR's ongoing series '50 great voices,' this one honoring a singer I'd never heard of, Esma Redzepova. The series has cast its net laudably wide; I realized that, opera lover though I am, I was a lot happier to learn about Redzepova, a world-famous Yugoslavian vocal star, than to hear one more segment extolling some opera singer I already loved (so far, Maria Callas is the only opera singer the series has featured). Redzepova has a voice that sounds like a beat-up Mustang barreling along a street full of potholes: it's gamey and battered and tough and it's been places and it's going more places and it doesn't really care what's in its way. I was particularly struck by the story of the years of training she put in to get it that way. She's 64 now and still performing actively, so you'd better believe she knows what she's doing. To back this up she told the kind of maybe- apocryphal story that's a part of every great singer's legend, about practicing for two years four hours a day, five days a week (I find it particularly endearing that she took weekends off), to elevate her voice from pretty and ineffectual to the sustained force it is today. I wish every classical singer would listen to this segment for the lessons it has to teach about the meaning of technique. Technique isn't just something that refines your voice into a polished, finished, pretty product, although too many singers and teachers do approach it that way. Technique, for Redzepova, was about blowing the whole instrument open, turning it into a powerhouse that could sustain heavy use without damage. Technique is something sturdy. It enables you to dig in and get some use out of your instrument. This is just as true of opera singers as of the so-called 'Queen of the Gypsies.' I don't mean that opera singers want to sound like Redzepova, but I do mean that most of the great classical singers have had this kind of solid technique, a voice that can stand up to some wear and tear and still sound glorious after a few decades: think Flagstad, Melchior or Sutherland. I also wish that opera, today, could win back some of the visceral appeal that Redzepova demonstrates. Not everyone is going to like the way she sounds, but I think nearly anyone who hears her can tell what she's trying to do and whether she's doing it well. Opera, by contrast, seems so artificial to so many people that non-aficionados often respond by simply being impressed by the volume. I've written before about attending rehearsals with young singers and seeing people giving signs of being tremendously impressed about singing that was uncertain, out of tune, without rhythmic integrity. These same people would never tolerate such singing in another musical genre, but when it comes to opera, they presume they don't understand it well enough to judge it, and simply overlook anything that sounds bad, as if it must be part of the convention. I think if more singers today dug in and let loose with Redzepova's brand of direct honesty it would be a lot easier to overcome the widespread sense of 'otherness' in opera, reach out more directly to new listeners, and restore the visceral thrill that, at its best, the genre is about. - 0 - Midgette, Washington Post classical music critic, writes the 'Classical Beat' blog on washingtonpost.com, from which this article is adapted.

1,"A few weeks before organizing a massive rally on the Mall that had the feel of a religious revival, Glenn Beck sought the blessing of some of the country's most prominent conservative Christian leaders. The Fox talk show host wanted their support as he shifted from political commentary to a more spiritual message, he told the group of about 20. This is where God is leading me, Beck declared, according to Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, who was there, along with Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. Land said most in the group found Beck's faith genuine and heartfelt, although not everyone agreed to embrace him publicly. 'We walked back to the hotel after and said, 'That was extraordinary,' ' Land said of his conversation with Dobson after the dinner in Manhattan. 'I've never heard a cultural figure of that popularity talking that overtly about his faith. He sounded like Billy Graham.' Two days after Beck's 'Restoring Honor' rally drew a crowd that stretched from the Lincoln Memorial to the World War II Memorial, many Americans were still trying to figure out if the commentator had just seized the mantle of the religious right. Conservative Christian talk radio was crackling with debate about Beck's Mormonism. Religious progressives were assailing his attacks on President Barack Obama's Christianity. Scholars of religion and politics were analyzing Beck's evangelical-like talk of being saved from drug and alcohol addiction. Some pastor-bloggers were bemoaning what they consider the conflation of celebrity, politics and spirituality. 'Politically, everyone is with it, but theologically, when he says the country should turn back to God, the question is: Which God?' said Tom Tradup, vice president for news and talk at Salem Radio Network,which serves more than 2,000 stations, most of them Christian. 'How much of this is turning to God? How much is religious revival and how much is a snake oil medicine show?' In a matter of hours, Beck went from a hugely popular media figure - a Gallup poll last year listed him as the fourth most admired living man in the country - to a spiritual player, embracing a new and overtly religious rhetoric that made him sound like an evangelist. Yet the Mormon convert seems an unlikely leader for conservative Christians, many of whom don't regard Mormonism as part of their faith. Even as the event was billed as nonpartisan, and attendees were told not to bring political signs, it was impossible to untangle the Fox News commentator from the political anger of the 'tea party' movement and the bitter 2010 campaign season. Republican leader Sarah Palin was one of his guest speakers and Beck was interviewed after the rally characterizing Obama's faith as being dominated by an 'oppressor-victim' paradigm. 'People aren't recognizing his version of Christianity,' Beck said on 'Fox News Sunday.' It wasn't the first time he had aimed withering criticism at Obama. In the days leading up to the rally, he described the president's religious beliefs as 'liberation theology' that represented 'a perversion of the gospel of Jesus Christ as most Christians know it.' To those who embrace it, liberation theology is a means to empower the poor, the weak and politically oppressed. To some, Beck's show of his faith was a calculated political effort to unite religious and social conservatives as the midterm elections approach. 'No Republican is going to win the White House if those two aren't united,' said D. Michael Lindsay, a Rice University sociologist who studies evangelical Protestant leaders. 'Here's a chance to infuse the tea party with religious rhetoric, and extend an olive branch to those not as engaged with financial issues.' Longtime Beck-watchers said he has always made references to his faith journey, his conversion from Catholicism to Mormonism, his crediting God with saving him from drug and alcohol abuse, professional obscurity and 'friendlessness.' But in the run-up to Saturday's rally, Beck talked publicly and privately about God working through him, calling a pre-rally event Friday 'Divine Destiny' and lining up evangelical pastor John Hagee and other religious leaders to appear with him. 'I'm a little nervous about that kind of talk,' said Janet Mefferd, a nationally syndicated Christian talk show host who said most callers Monday wanted to talk about Beck. 'I know he means well and loves this country, but he doesn't know enough about theology to know what kind of effect he's having. Christians are hearing something different than what he thinks he's saying.' Although he doesn't consider Mormons to be Christians, Land said he agrees with Beck's basic premise that American society must be 'rebuilt from the bottom up.' Land accepted an invitation to be part of a group of more than 200 clergy members whom Beck calls his 'Black Robed Regiment,' a reference to pastors from the Revolutionary War who stirred up opposition to colonial rule. Asked who would be considered conservative Christian leaders today - with Graham in his 90s and the recent death of Jerry Falwell - Land said that 'leaders are leaders because people follow them. Obviously, Glenn Beck is a leader. He's in a category by himself. He's not a minister, he's not a politician.' Conservative Christian leaders of the future, he said, are less likely to be clergy members, because it's harder to be an overt partisan and keep your tax- exempt status. Among those considered top leaders, he said, are former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). This isn't the first time Beck's faith has been scrutinized. Prominent Mormons have occasionally criticized him as being an entertainer, not a theologian. After an interview in 2008 with Focus on the Family, the article was pulled because some of the group's supporters thought it was wrongly validating his conversion experience. "
1,"FIFA said 53,000 World Cup tickets were sold in the first eight hours of the final phase on Thursday, and blamed high demand for the technical problems that caused delays and led to fan frustration. FIFA said 23 of the 64 games were sold out after tickets went on sale at ticket centers and banks across South Africa. Match, the company employed by FIFA to run the ticket process, apologized for the glitches which led police to be called to centers in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria to calm frustrated fans. Match chief executive Jaime Byrom said they 'identified the challenges' and thanked fans for their patience. About 500,000 seats were made available to local fans, the first time 2010 tickets could be bought for cash. Earlier, police were called to the World Cup ticket center in Cape Town as FIFA's attempt to boost sluggish ticket sales made fans angry at the delays caused by technical difficulties. A crowd gathered at the entrance to the center and chanted and yelled at organizers. Police were called to keep them calm. After 3 1/2 hours, only 32 people out of a crowd of about 1,000 managed to buy tickets. 'No one's informed us what's going on. No one's directing the public outside. A primary school sports event could be better organized than this,' said Theo Spangenberg, who had been waiting for 16 hours and still hadn't made it inside the newly opened facility. 'For a World Cup, an international event of this nature, it's a really, really bad show.' The carnival atmosphere at the start of the day, as fans across the country were given a first chance to buy some of the 500,000 tickets still available, quickly disappeared in Cape Town. About 300 tickets for the final were to be sold on a first-come first-served basis. Fans inside the ticketing center slept on the floor as they waited to be served. A representative from Match said she could not guarantee that every person would be helped on Thursday. 'I can understand there's a lot of frustrated people outside, and we have experienced some teething problems, since it is our first day,' Christa Venter said. 'The IT guys are well aware of the problem. Obviously it is a timely process, since we are experiencing quite high volumes at this stage countrywide.' Earlier in Cape Town, a 64-year-old man died of an apparent heart attack, but it was not related to the problems at the ticket office. Local media also reported crowd scuffles at the ticket office in Pretoria. The ticket centers opened across the country at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) for the last phase of sales. Thousands of fans lined up outside the Maponya shopping mall in Soweto -- near where the opening game and the final will be held at Soccer City. FIFA ticket center manager Richard Lalla said the final tickets would last 'a few minutes,' but that was enough time for Malin Fisher, a 32-year-old trainee church minister, who spent more than 10,000 rands ($1,370) on six tickets, including two for football's biggest game. Fisher was first through the doors after queuing overnight and said it was 'an incredible feeling' to have tickets. 'There are no words (to describe it). I've spent a couple of rands but it's all worth it,' he said while holding his tickets up for photographers and TV cameras. 'The Internet and applying was a bit frustrating but to be able to buy World Cup final tickets over the counter, that was amazing.' Fisher is one of many South Africans to be frustrated by FIFA's initial online process, which did not work for local supporters who are not used to buying tickets for football games on the Internet. Many are on low incomes and have no access to the Internet and no credit cards. 'I didn't even bother to go onto the Internet to buy because it was a waste of time to me,' Nodoimpela Dlamini said as he waited patiently outside Maponya Mall. 'Most of my colleagues who had applied through the Internet had been refused and actually couldn't get tickets.' FIFA and local organizers are under pressure to sell the remaining 450,000 match tickets for the monthlong tournament, which begins on June 11, to avoid a PR disaster of empty stadiums. 'I think the original process had to be put in place so that everyone across the country and across the world could have a fair chance to get their hands on some tickets,' Lalla said. 'Now that it is over the counter, I think our South African market is excited because this is what we are used to, this is our culture. It's more for our market now and people will do really well with the tickets that are left.' In Sandton, an upper class area in Johannesburg, the city's second ticket center was also hit by technical problems. Ticket machines had 'out of order' signs on them and police were called to watch over the disgruntled fans. ------ Associated Press writer Nastasya Tay in Cape Town contributed to this report. "
1,"In a letter to President Obama seven months ago, 10 Republican senators led by Utah's Orrin Hatch urged him to use tax relief to bolster the U.S. economy and create jobs. Top on their list: extend and improve a research and development tax credit for businesses. 'We urge you to help us enact a strong research incentive to keep us first in the world,' the senators wrote. Another tax break long popular with Republicans would let companies immediately deduct the cost of capital investments. In 2008, House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio described it as giving employers 'greater incentive to invest and create jobs for more Americans searching for work.' Obama this month offered both proposals as part of his push to spur economic growth. Now, with House and Senate elections looming on Nov. 2, Obama's proposals are getting a chilly reception from Republicans. They say Obama's plans are flawed because he would also let the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy expire and increase taxes elsewhere. 'There's tremendous pressure on the Republican leadership, since things look so favorable for picking up seats, not to give the Democrats some type of advantage,' said Lee Edwards, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington- based policy research group that promotes limited government. 'In today's partisan atmosphere, it's difficult to come together on a solution like this,' he said. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 9.6 percent heading into November's elections, Obama called for permanently extending and expanding the research tax credit at a cost of about $100 billion over 10 years. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their terms also backed a permanent extension of the tax credit, which Congress extends only temporarily because of its high cost. Obama additionally wants to let companies fully deduct the cost of purchasing equipment such as tractors, wind turbines and computers. It's a more generous deduction than one that applied in 2008 and 2009 that allowed businesses to deduct 50 percent of their capital investment costs using so-called bonus depreciation. The president's proposal would cost about $30 billion over 10 years, the administration estimates. The National Association of Manufacturers, headed by Republican John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, in July urged Congress to extend bonus depreciation. In a statement, the group said it is 'a proven incentive for manufacturers of all sizes to invest in new, more efficient equipment, stimulating much-needed economic growth and job creation.' Bonus depreciation was a feature of stimulus measures adopted in 2002, 2003 and 2008 under Bush, who touted its benefits in 2006 while visiting a manufacturing company in Cincinnati. 'They've expanded because of the bonus depreciation schedule,' Bush said. 'The tax cuts encourage them to buy equipment, and when you buy equipment, you expand your business.' Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Obama's Republican opponent in the 2008 presidential contest, made both tax breaks part of his economic plan during the campaign. As of now, Obama's proposals aren't likely to get help from congressional Republicans, who are focused on the bigger debate with Democrats over extension of the income tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration. Both parties want to extend the cuts for individual income up to $200,000 and up to $250,000 for couples filing jointly, or about 97 percent of all taxpayers, according to data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Republicans want to keep the cuts for those in the higher income brackets, which Obama opposes. Raising taxes for the wealthiest Americans will defeat the purpose of business tax incentives, some Republicans say. 'A permanent research tax credit and allowing businesses to write off 100 percent of their investment in equipment are good ideas, but any positive impact on the economy would be crushed by tax increases on other parts of the economy,' said Hatch in statement following a Sept. 8 economic speech by Obama in Cleveland outlining his plans. 'These aren't necessarily bad proposals,' Boehner said in a statement ahead of Obama's speech. 'But they don't address the two big problems that are hurting our economy -- excessive government spending and the uncertainty that Washington Democrats' policies, especially their massive tax hike, are creating for small businesses.' Hatch sought unsuccessfully on Sept. 16 to add a measure making the research tax credit permanent to a small business assistance bill that passed the Senate. In blocking Hatch's proposal, Democrats said it would have required the overall legislation, held up by Republicans for months, to go back to committee. Hatch's move was another 'in a series of delays thrown up in front of this bill,' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Finance Committee. Baucus said he planned to bring up the research credit, which expired at the end of 2009, later this year after lawmakers had more time to work on it. Obama has suggested his proposals be paid for by eliminating certain tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas. That has fueled Republican opposition to his initiatives. 'If the offsets for this new package are other tax increases, then it's a non- starter,' Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the Finance Committee's top Republican, said in a Sept. 7 statement. 'To Republicans' ears, a tax cut never sounds great when it comes from a Democrat's mouth, because they always assume there will be a catch,' said Jack Pitney, who teaches politics at Claremont (Calif.) McKenna College. "
1,"Police said Wednesday they have arrested a suspect in connection with a daring daytime heist that netted $65 million worth of jewelry from a prominent London diamond merchant last week. Police said the 50-year-old man, who was subsequently released on bail, is not one of two dapper dressers captured in security camera footage released by Scotland Yard on Tuesday. The footage showed two men in smart suits being let into Graff Diamonds flagship store, where police say they produced guns, briefly took a member of staff hostage and escaped in a series of getaway cars across central London. Police believe at least two others helped the pair escape. No one was hurt in the robbery, one of the biggest in British history. British authorities seldom release suspects' names until they are charged. Amateur video shot outside the store appeared to capture the men's escape and screaming shoppers as a warning shot is fired into the ground. Police said the men made off with dozens of high-end rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches with a retail value of 40 million pounds, or $65 million. A full list of the 43 pilfered items was made public Wednesday: Among the jewels was a flowing flower necklace made from 272 separate diamonds and a lavish pair of triple-hoop earrings bearing no fewer than 216 gemstones. Although the man was arrested Monday, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said police kept news of his capture secret until now for 'operational reasons.' She spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with department policy. Police declined to say what amount they set as bail. Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace told reporters that the robbers were 'extremely dangerous.' She appealed for information about the heist, saying the men 'would undoubtedly have spoken about it beforehand or boasted about it afterwards.' "

1,"U.S. intelligence believes that the secret Iranian nuclear facility acknowledged by Iran this week is in an underground tunnel complex on a military base controlled by the elite Revolutionary Guards. The details were included in a document that Obama administration sent to U.S. lawmakers. Excerpts were provided to The Association Press by an official on condition of anonymity because the document, though unclassifed, was confidential. The document says the facility is 'too small to be viable for the production of fuel for a nuclear power reactor, but may be well suited for a military purpose.' The location at the military base would also undermine Iran's claim that the program is for civilian purposes. U.S. intelligence indicates that Iran was installing centrifuge equipment this year. "

1,"Montenegro's government on Thursday canceled a euro2.7 billion ($3.69 billion) deal with a Croatian company to build a highway in the tiny Adriatic country. A consortium lead by Croatian Konstruktor Inzenjering d.d. had won the bidding last year to build a 170-kilometer (105-mile) stretch of highway from the Adriatic coast to the Montenegrin border with Serbia. But it but has failed to provide financial guarantees for the job by the end of February, as was envisaged by the terms of the agreement. Montenegrin government said it will now turn to an Israeli-Greek consortium, which was the second-placed bidder. "
1,"Posing in shorts, a three-piece suit and work clothes, Pablo Picasso stands in his studio staring down at the camera as if from Olympus, a stocky god challenging anyone to question his prowess. The photographs were taken in 1915 when he was just 27. He would die in 1973, intensely active until the end. 'Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art' documents the career he himself found formidable with works drawn entirely from the collection of the New York museum. By 1915, Picasso had left his native Spain for Paris, worked through his melancholy blue and lucky-in-love rose periods, come up with cubism and was entering his neoclassical phase before moving on to surrealism. Examples from each period make up more than half the exhibition, which, although having 34 paintings, includes some of Picasso's best-known pictures of harlequins, bulls, bathers, wives and mistresses. A showstopper is his chunky 1905-06 portrait of Gertrude Stein, who would give it to the Met in 1946 and start the museum's belated foray into modernism. Yet what sets the show apart are the 58 drawings and 200 prints, some only now plucked from the museum's storage, that confirm his genius as a draftsman. Look, for instance, at a suite of 11 postcard-size caricatures in ink and watercolor of Parisian friends who patronized a Montmartre artists' cabaret. Most striking is his own idealized portrait, in which he appears as a dashing dandy with long flowing hair and fancy dress. Nearby is a crudely painted canvas, 'Erotic Scene' (1902 or 1903), that the Met had been keeping under wraps _ not because of its prurient content but because Picasso had disowned it. Now experts say he did it when he was desperate for money. It looks like a junk-shop find. Picasso seemed to change his style whenever a new woman entered or exited from his life. His liaison with Fernande Olivier induced his rose period and a picture like 'The Actor,' a slender column of a circus performer in red tights gesturing with his exceedingly long hands. (This is its first reappearance since January, when a visitor accidentally tore it.) The breakup of his marriage to Olga Khokhlova generated a chilling, bone-colored surrealist nude, while the sensual Marie-Therese Walter brought about 'The Dreamer,' a pink and lavender abstraction. Among the standout drawings is a 1908 watercolor study of a slit-eyed, chisel- nosed female head with brilliant green and blue shadows. By the time he was 87, however, the medium had become a primary focus, and the show ends with the '347 Suite,' a knockout series of small, exquisite images that Picasso made in 1968. It reads as a storybook of mythical characters that also amounts to a career summation of Picasso's most playful figures. _ 'Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,' through Aug. 1 at the Met, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd St.; 212-535-7710.

1,"With clergy sex abuse scandals unfolding across Catholic Europe, a 2009 survey of the U.S. Catholic Church released Tuesday showed the lowest numbers of child victims, allegations and financial payouts since the annual survey began in 2004, shortly after the issue exploded in the United States. The survey _ funded by the bishops but conducted by independent researchers _ relies mostly on data supplied by dioceses themselves. It shows 398 new victims came forward in 2009 with 'credible allegations of sexual abuse' of a minor, down each year from 889 in 2004. They named 286 priests and deacons, 45 percent of whom had not been named before. Last year, the U.S. Church paid out $104 million, including $6.5 million for victims' therapy, $10.9 million for offenders (including therapy and living expenses) and $28.7 million in lawyers' fees. Some advocates for abuse survivors called the survey a sham, noting it relies on data provided by church bodies. Dioceses, eparchies and religious orders were polled, and 15 percent did not complete the survey. 'Can anyone really think that the Catholic hierarchy's deeply rooted, centuries- old patterns of self-serving secrecy and deceit have suddenly been reversed and that heinous crimes once routinely hidden are now routinely revealed?' said David Clohessy, executive director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. There is passionate disagreement about how far the American church has come in the past decade on clergy sex abuse. Some believe the U.S. church has become a model for public schools and groups that work with children, pointing to the creation of reporting systems and abuse point-people at each diocese, payments and other outreach to victims, heightened screening at seminaries, and criminal background checks of people who work in parishes with youth. 'The church's efforts to come to grips with these problems within the household of faith _ which have been more far-reaching than in any other institution or sector of society _ have led others to look to the Catholic Church for guidance on how to address what is, in fact, a global plague,' papal biographer and commentator George Weigel wrote last weekend after Pope Benedict XVI issued an apology to sex abuse victims in Ireland. Others see only panels and paperwork and an internal culture that has not changed, never holding accountable bishops and church leaders who allowed offenders to continue their ministries. 'All this stuff affects the 99 percent of people who aren't part of the problem. It's the bishops and the priests' (that are), Clohessy said. 'As long as Catholic employees still see bishops minimizing, denying clergy sex crimes, they'll do it, too.' Clohessy noted Tuesday that the church spent more in 2009 on financial support for offenders and legal fees than on victims. He predicted that more cases will come to light in the future, in part because the U.S. church is forced to import priests from other countries as American men opt out of the priesthood. "
1,"Xerox, the largest maker of high-speed color printers, jumped the most since April in trading Thursday after posting second-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates and boosting its full-year forecast. Per-share profit, excluding some costs, was 24 cents a share, the Norwalk, Conn.-based company said in a statement. Analysts estimated 21 cents on average, according to a Bloomberg survey. The company said full-year earnings, excluding costs, would be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share, compared with the previous forecast of at most 85 cents. Xerox increased revenue 2 percent to $5.5 billion as customers resumed spending after curbing costs amid the recession. The company also got a sales boost from its $6 billion purchase of Affiliated Computer Services, its bid to expand into services. 'Demand is coming back,' said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research in Livingston, N.J., who rates the shares 'buy.' 'It shows the synergies with ACS are working _ that's important to investors.' Xerox added 62 cents, or 7.4 percent, to $9.03 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest jump since April 23. The shares have advanced 6.7 percent this year. Equipment sales, an indicator of future sales for products such as ink and paper, jumped 12 percent to $930 million. Buying ACS, which handles payroll and other administrative work, helped Chief Executive Officer Ursula Burns triple revenue from services last quarter. In May, ACS signed a $1.6 billion contract to manage California's Medicaid information system for 10 years. The company has signed 10 deals by selling ACS services to Xerox customers and vice versa since the acquisition closed in February, Burns said on a conference call today. 'These are signs of modest, yet steady economic improvement,' Burns said on the call. 'Demand continues to improve.' Expense reductions alone make the ACS deal attractive, before any potential impact on revenue, Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore wrote in a note July 14. The company is on track to save more than $100 million this year as a result of the ACS takeover, it said in May. The number may top $375 million in three years. The full-year profit forecast topped the average analyst estimate of 87 cents a share. The company said it expects per-share earnings this quarter of 19 cents to 21 cents, in line with estimates. Net income for the second quarter rose to $227 million, or 16 cents a share, from $140 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier before the ACS acquisition. Xerox is using services from ACS to automate its own administrative tasks, trimming costs. It has also cut 2,500 jobs this year and will take a $280 million restructuring charge this year, which should lead to an additional $140 million in savings. The company will lower debt to $8.7 billion by the end of the year, from $9.6 billion now, the company said. It will be $8 billion by September 2011. Xerox is on track to reach $1 billion in cash by the second half of next year, when it will consider resuming share repurchases, Chief Financial Officer Larry Zimmerman said in an interview. "

1,"The subcommittee that investigated Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has recommended that the embattled lawmaker face just a 'reprimand,' a mild form of punishment similar to that given to Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., when he was rebuked in 1997. Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, told reporters Friday that his four-member investigative subcommittee did not seek the high-level punishments of censure or expulsion, opting for a mid-level sanction that requires the full House to approve it but carries no other penalty. 'The recommendation we had was a reprimand,' Green said, 'and I'll let the full committee make that decision.' Also Friday, President Barack Obama made his first comments about the case since the charges were announced. 'I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well,' Obama said in an interview aired by CBS Evening News. 'But these allegations are very troubling. And he'll _ he's somebody who's at the end of his career. Eighty years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity. And my hope is that it happens.' Rangel's legal team held out hope that the lawmaker could reach a settlement with the adjudicatory subcommittee hearing his case, potentially avoiding political fallout from the trial _ planned for mid-September _ on the critical midterm elections. But after huddling throughout Thursday evening and all day Friday, the full ethics committee made no new declarations on the Rangel case. According to Republican counts, 10 House Democrats have now called on Rangel to resign, nine of whom were elected for the first time in 2006 or 2008 and now face difficult reelections in November. 'It's been a long haul,' said Rep. Zack Space, D-Ohio, who in 2006 won the seat vacated by Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the Jack Abramoff scandal. 'I think he should resign, out of concern for the institution and the particularity of the allegations.' Green and Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Ala., the top Republican on the investigative subcommittee, are serving as the prosecution in the Rangel trial, which began Thursday in a preliminary hearing with the unveiling of their statement charging the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee with 13 counts of violating House rules. They are presenting their evidence to an 'adjudicatory subcommittee,' made up of four Democrats and four Republicans who are serving as the judge and jury. The charges include allegations that Rangel violated House rules or federal laws by soliciting donations from people with business before his committee to fund a center named in his honor at City College of New York, not paying taxes on a Caribbean home, improperly using a rent-stabilized apartment in New York as a campaign office, and not properly disclosing more than $600,000 in income and assets. If the panel finds Rangel guilty, it could then impose its own level of punishment. But the recommendation of Green and Bonner would weigh heavily on that decision, much as a prosecutor's sentencing recommendation would influence a judge in a criminal trial. In January 1997, the House voted 395 to 28 to reprimand Gingrich because of the financing related to a college course the then-speaker taught in the 1990s. That reprimand also came with an unprecedented $300,000 fine because the outside counsel who conducted the investigation found that Gingrich had misled the investigation. Green clarified the frenzy that led up to the final hour before Thursday's preliminary hearing, in which various media outlets reported that there was a 'deal' or that Rangel was 'close to a deal.' No such deal or settlement was ever that close, according to Green. Earlier this month, after several face-to-face sessions with Rangel, negotiation talks broke down with Green and Bonner and the other two members of the investigative subcommittee. In the run-up to Thursday's hearing, Rangel's legal team continued talking with the committee's nonpartisan attorneys, but never were close enough to bring Green and Bonner into the talks. 'I was never approached after about two weeks ago. There may have been discussions with other folks,' Green said. "
1,"Record rains from a powerful typhoon caused massive landslides in Taiwan that buried a Buddhist temple and trapped vehicles on a highway, where one bus carrying 19 Chinese tourists was missing Friday. The mudslide at the temple killed nine people, and a total of 23 people were missing in Taiwan as Typhoon Megi swept toward southern China, where landfall was expected later Saturday. The storm earlier killed 26 people and damaged homes and crops in the Philippines. Megi dumped a record 45 inches (114 centimeters) of rain in Taiwan's Ilan county over 48 hours. It had winds of 90 miles per hour (145 kilometers per hour) and was about 275 miles (440 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong on Friday evening, the Hong Kong Observatory said. Nine people, including two Buddhist nuns, were killed at the White Cloud Temple in Suao city along the eastern coast when a mudslide buried the building, the Central Emergency Operations Center said Saturday. Two buses carrying Chinese tourists were on a six-mile (10-kilometer) stretch of a coastal highway in Ilan that was hit by at least seven rockslides Thursday night, Premier Wu Den-yih said. Nineteen people on one bus were rescued -- five with light to moderate injuries -- but the Taiwanese driver and the Chinese tour guide were still missing, Wu said. There had been no contact with the driver, tour guide and 19 tourists aboard the other bus, he said. News reports Saturday cited a rescued traveler as saying he spotted a bus being hit by a boulder and falling into the sea. It is not immediately clear if the vehicle was the missing bus. Officials said a 500-yard (500-meter) stretch of the highway had collapsed. The rockslides trapped about 30 vans, buses and cars, they said. Air force helicopters were searching for the missing bus, while all other stranded travelers had been rescued by early Saturday, Interior Minister Chiang Yi-hua said. The storm dumped heavy rains throughout Taiwan, but Ilan, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Taipei, was the hardest hit. Authorities said more than 2,500 residents had been evacuated. Broad swaths of farmland in the county were under many feet (several meters) of water. Earlier this week, Megi killed more than two dozen people and damaged thousands of homes in the northern Philippines. The storm also forced 55,000 Filipinos from their homes and caused about $175 million in damage to infrastructure and crops, disaster officials said. Megi was expected to hit China's southern Guangdong and Fujian provinces between Friday night and Saturday, meteorologists said. In Fujian, authorities said 161,800 people were evacuated to safer places. An official in Guangdong's Shantou city said fishermen were told to return to ports and authorities designated some 200 buildings in the city as emergency shelters. 'This kind of strong typhoon is very rare for this season in Shantou. We are treating it as a 'super strong typhoon' and making our preparations accordingly,' said a relief official who only gave his surname, Chen. In Vietnam, the death toll from severe flooding in four central provinces climbed to 75, including 14 victims from a bus swept off a road by strong currents, with six passengers still missing, disaster officials said Friday. While Megi bypassed Vietnam, the country's central region was pummeled by 4.6 feet (140 centimeters) of rain over the past week, inundating large swaths of land, submerging nearly 280,000 houses and forcing more than 170,000 villagers from their homes. Meanwhile, another storm, Cyclone Giri, was spinning in the Bay of Bengal and likely to make landfall Saturday in western Myanmar. The storm was expected to hit with winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and a tidal surge as high as 12 feet (370 centimeters). Cyclone Nargis in 2008 killed 130,000 people in Myanmar. ------ Associated Press writers Min Lee and Cara Anna in Hong Kong, Hrvoje Hranjski in Manila, and researcher Zhao Liang in Beijing contributed to this report.

1,"David L. Wolper, a Hollywood impresario who produced an astonishing range of documentary films, big-screen movies and TV shows and who helped establish the popular miniseries form with his adaptations of 'Roots' and 'The Thorn Birds,' died Aug. 10 at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He had congestive heart disease and Parkinson's disease. He was 82. Wolper, one of the great entrepreneurs of television, was a persistent and persuasive salesman with an unfailing gift to spot the commercial potential in the most unlikely of subject matter. In 1966, Wolper's company produced the National Geographic special 'The World of Jacques-Yves Cousteau,' which launched the little-known French oceanographer to a mass audience. 'I knew fish would be great on television because the tube would look like a fish tank,' he later said. His career was sprawling and in many ways uncategorizable. As a young man, he packaged old movies to the burgeoning television market and helped usher in the era of 'late show' programming. He transitioned from salesman to producer when he bought up Russian space footage and transformed it into an Academy Award- nominated documentary, 'The Race for Space' (1959). He continued to prosper as a documentarian, notably when he persuaded Pulitzer Prize-winning author Theodore H. White to sell him the rights to his book 'The Making of the President, 1960.' The resulting collaboration led to an Emmy Award-winning television adaptation in 1963. Wolper's production company later made the compelling and elegiac 'Four Days in November' (1964), about the days leading up to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, as well as rousing historical films ('Victory at Entebbe' 1976) and fascinating but obscure documentaries including 'The Hellstrom Chronicle' (1971), an Oscar winner about the insect world. In a career spanning six decades, Wolper produced feature films including 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (1971) and 'L.A. Confidential' (1997). He produced extravaganzas including the 1986 celebration in New York of the Statue of Liberty centennial and the 1984 Olympic Games ceremonies in Los Angeles, which required a masterful orchestration of marching bands, grand pianos, drill teams and high-stepping dancers. His work in television included popular 1970s sitcoms 'Chico and the Man' and 'Welcome Back, Kotter,' and intensely forgettable fare such as 'Get Christie Love!' (1974), a blackspoitation police drama about a sexy supercop, and a short-lived 1983 series based on the film classic 'Casablanca.' By most accounts, Wolper's greatest legacy was bringing 'Roots' to television. Alex Haley's best-selling novel, which won a special Pulitzer Prize citation in 1977, traced a black family across seven generations from its origins in Africa to America. The subsequent miniseries ran an unprecedented eight nights in 1977 on ABC and was seen by an estimated 130 million people, making it the highest- rated entertainment program in television history. Robert J. Thompson, a scholar of television and popular culture at Syracuse University, said 'Roots' dominated the national discussion for weeks and months and swept the Emmy Awards. He said the show was also crucial from an artistic perspective in allowing a rare and very public dramatic outlet for leading and promising black actors of the day, including LeVar Burton, John Amos, Cicely Tyson and Ben Vereen. Wolper said his greatest challenge was making 'Roots' _ and any project _ palatable to the largest possible audience. He said the struggle with 'Roots' was how to capture the full scale of the drama without alienating white viewers. He used black and white performers with long track records on stage and television because they would be most familiar to TV watchers. Wolper and producer Stan Margulies shared Emmys in the category of Outstanding Limited Series for 'Roots' and the sequel 'Roots: The Next Generations' (1979). They later were nominated for Emmys for their production of 'The Thorn Birds' (1983), another expansive series that attracted a devoted following. Of 'The Thorn Birds,' Wolper later said, 'I had to take that novel, which was basically a soap opera, and make the media perceive it as classy.' He said he achieved that by casting respected actors such as Christopher Plummer, Jean Simmons and Richard Kiley for major roles. Wolper went on to produce the historical miniseries 'North and South' (1985) and two sequels, all of which drew critical derision and huge ratings. His ability to marshal epic series led to his work staging the opening and closing ceremonies of 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games, which garnered Wolper a special Emmy award and the prestigious Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. 'The minute I went into business I was a success, and I've done well ever since,' Wolper told People magazine at the time. 'I can possibly say I have entertained and educated more people than anyone else in the world.' David Lloyd Wolper was born in New York on Jan. 11, 1928. He was the only child of a commercial real-estate broker, whose financial condition ebbed and flowed during the Depression. He was 18 when his mother died from a ruptured appendix. He enjoyed hustling from a young age, partnering with a classmate to start a band of New York high school musicians. He worked on the margins of the film industry while attending the University of Southern California, where one of his classmates was Art Buchwald. Wolper managed Buchwald's college humor magazine and promoted the future columnist's college varsity show, 'No Love Atoll.' 'He always had a tremendous amount of chutzpah,' Buchwald told People magazine. 'His greatest stunt was crashing the Academy Awards with a man in a gorilla suit and a sign saying, `If you think this is good, wait till you see `No Love Atoll.' They were able to walk up and down the aisles for 10 minutes before they were thrown out.' Wolper left college in 1949 and helped start a business to sell old Flash Gordon serials and other fare to television stations that needed to fill airtime cheaply. Wolper was married three times, first to a showgirl he never identified. His second marriage, to actress Dawn Richard, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, the former Gloria Hill; three children from his second marriage; and 10 grandchildren. Wolper said the one concession he made to his wealth and stature was collecting Picassos. Otherwise, he enjoyed the anonymity of the producer's life. 'I make the money and I don't have to take the abuse some of the stars do, opening up their personal life,' he told the Associated Press in 1999. 'I can go into a restaurant, sit down and have a nice meal without being harassed. Arnold Schwarzenegger can't do that.' "

The women were seeking to overturn a lower court ruling that allowed Vancouver organizers to hold a men's ski jumping competition but not a women's event. The women argued that violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

1,"On what remains of Wall Street these days, the past year was filled with one opportunity after another to fix the myriad fundamental structural deficiencies -- revealed all too painfully by the financial crisis -- that continue to plague the country's large securities firms. At year's end, not a single one had been adequately addressed, let alone resolved. This ongoing failure to act in the face of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is especially disappointing since President Barack Obama was elected, in part, on a promise to bring constructive and lasting change to the canyons of Wall Street. A few weeks after the 2008 presidential election, Rahm Emanuel, newly appointed as Obama's chief of staff, spoke at a Wall Street Journal conference and reflected on the numerous crises -- financial, energy-related and in foreign policy --that the Bush administration had left for Obama to clean up. 'You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,' Emanuel said, 'and what I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.' The coming changes to the financial regulatory system, he added, should be based upon the principles of 'transparency and accountability.' Emanuel had it exactly right. So did Obama, 10 months later on the one-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when he addressed business leaders at Federal Hall at the corner of Wall and Broad streets. 'We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses,' he said. He went on to demand 'strong rules of the road to guard against the kind of systemic risks we have seen' and asked Wall Street to join in rewriting the regulations for a new post-crash epoch. Alas, we still await the reforms that are so desperately needed to prevent the recurrence of the speculative bubbles -- and their vicious unwinding -- that have become all too prevalent during the last 25 years of laissez-faire regulations and unalloyed hubris and greed among many finance professionals. Not surprisingly, as Congress dallies, Wall Street has been only too happy to return with all deliberate speed to business as usual. Only now, things are better than ever for it. The Wall Street firms that were bailed out thanks to taxpayer largesse -- especially Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase -- have the best of all possible worlds: little or no regulatory reform, far fewer serious competitors and an absurdly low interest-rate environment that allows them to obtain financing for close to nothing, from the Fed or from the public markets. Through arbitrage, they can then take advantage of widening spreads to reap levels of profitability unimaginable a year ago. Hard to imagine that in September 2008, Goldman was on its way to following Morgan Stanley down the tubes. Now Goldman is expected to rack up record pretax earnings of around $17 billion in 2009 and to pay out close to $23 billion in employee bonuses, according to the New York Times. This surely could not have been the intent of Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Larry Summers, Christina Romer et al. as they constructed the various rescue financings and capital infusions that pulled capitalism back from the brink of the abyss. Or was it? True, some baby steps of regulatory reform are inching their way through Congress. House Democrats, without a single Republican vote, passed a reform bill that would create a new Financial Services Oversight Council to more closely monitor Wall Street behavior, a $150 billion fund to help wind down any large firms that fail, and a watered-down version of a requirement that derivatives trading be done in public. Proclaimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 'The legislation says very clearly to Wall Street: the party is over.' Hardly. No one on Wall Street -- save for perhaps the forlorn employees of Citigroup, the last major U.S. financial services firm still owned in part by the government -- believes anything remotely close to this. What's more, the Senate's version of a financial reform bill is quite different from the House version, and any meaningful reconciliation of the two bills is not likely to happen until well into this year. Party on, Garth. What is most remarkable about both pieces of legislation is just how light a touch they seem to put on the powers-that-be on Wall Street. On one hand, this is entirely predictable: Wall Street remains superb at lining the pockets of its chief congressional overseers. On the other hand, it is a bitter disappointment. As but one example, the House bill has a provision requiring the comptroller general to 'carry out a study to determine whether there is a correlation between compensation structures and excessive risk taking' -- as if there is even the slightest doubt about that fact. The comptroller general's report isn't due until one year after the legislation passes. Oh yes, there is also a provision for a non-binding shareholder vote on the compensation paid to the top five executives of financial institutions of a certain size. Brutal. What the events of the past two years have made abundantly clear is that we have become a nation of slitherers, adept at blaming others and acts of God for our own stupid mistakes and repugnant behaviors. Will 2010 be the year Wall Street takes responsibility for what it did to cause the financial crisis? The American people are still waiting for Wall Street CEOs to explain what happened and why. Will it be the year when Wall Street's 40-year love affair with taking outsized risks with other people's money for its own benefit -- begun when Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette went public in 1970 -- is once and for all snuffed out? Not likely. But maybe 2010 will be the year that we finally listen to Paul Volcker, the 82 -year-old Obama economic adviser and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'I'm very interested in using this crisis as a way to avoid the next one,' he said Dec. 12 in a speech in Berlin echoing his boss. 'This isn't any time to go back to business as usual.'

1,"The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post: Senators are facing a simple, fateful decision: Do they want to allow millions of dollars from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals to pour, undisclosed, into U.S. elections? The key word is undisclosed. The existing crazy quilt of campaign finance reporting rules was already threadbare. Then the Supreme Court stepped in, ruling in the Citizens United case that corporations and labor unions could spend unlimited sums advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates. That made the implications of that regulatory patchwork far more dangerous. Corporations now can funnel money to a trade association to target Representative Y or Senator X. The trade association must report its spending to the Federal Election Commission, but it doesn't have to say where the money comes from. Labor unions could set up front groups to do the same. Under another gap in disclosure rules, wealthy individuals who want to influence elections without the inconvenience of having their cash exposed can give money to nonprofit groups set up under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code. Such organizations face limits on how much they can spend on election-related activities, but the limits are hardly an impediment. According to a report in Politico, conservatives recently created one such group, American Crossroads GPS. 'I wouldn't want to discount the value of confidentiality to some donors,' said its president, Steven Law. The House last month passed a measure, known as the Disclose Act, that would strengthen disclosure rules. There are some flaws in the proposal _ for instance, it goes too far in prohibiting independent expenditures by government contractors. And there is an unfortunate exemption from the disclosure requirements, demanded by the National Rifle Association as the price of not opposing the measure, for large, well-established national organizations. Nonetheless, the essence of the legislation is correct and critical to making certain that elections are not secretly influenced by special interests. As the Supreme Court itself said in the Citizens United case, 'The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.' The Senate faces a vote, perhaps as early as this week, about whether to kill or proceed with the Disclose Act. Senators who care about maintaining a transparent campaign finance system should vote to go forward with the measure. Its shortcomings can be addressed, but its central focus is critical to ensuring that democracy is not for sale to the highest bidder. "
1,"Orders for long-lasting goods rose in February for a third month, while inventories and backlogs climbed by the most in more than a year, indicating the manufacturing rebound will keep propelling the recovery. The 0.5 percent increase in bookings for durable goods was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and followed a 3.9 percent gain the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday in Washington. Excluding transportation equipment, orders advanced 0.9 percent, more than anticipated. Business spending on new equipment, inventory restocking and a pickup in global demand mean companies from Boeing to Owens-Illinois can look forward to sustained sales gains. A pickup in employment is needed to broaden the expansion as the economy heals from the worst recession since the 1930s. 'Manufacturing has and will continue to drive this recovery,' said David Semmens, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. 'Export demand will continue to grow, domestic orders continue to rise and the inventory liquidation cycle has stopped dragging on growth.' Economists anticipated a 0.6 percent gain in orders, according to the median of 77 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, after a previously reported 2.6 percent jump in January. Forecasts ranged from a decline of 2 percent to a 2 percent increase. Excluding transportation equipment, orders were forecast to rise 0.6 percent, according to the survey median. The Commerce Department revised January data to show a 0.6 percent drop rather than the initially reported 1 percent decrease. Orders excluding defense equipment increased 1.6 percent and bookings for military gear dropped 4.5 percent. Last month's gain in orders was led by a surge in aircraft bookings and increasing demand for machinery and metals. Boeing, the world's second-biggest commercial-plane maker, said it received 47 orders in February, up from 10 a month earlier. Chicago-based Boeing last week said it will boost production in coming years to meet stronger demand as airlines rebound from the recession-induced travel slump. Bookings for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for future business investment, increased 1.1 percent after dropping 3.9 percent the prior month. Shipments of those items, used in calculating gross domestic product, climbed 0.8 percent after a 1.9 percent decrease. Factories boosted durable-goods inventories by 0.3 percent, the biggest gain since December 2008. In a sign demand is starting to outstrip available resources, unfilled orders advanced 0.4 percent, the most since July 2008. Growing sales in the U.S. and abroad, and the need to replenish inventories are also helping companies such as Owens- Illinois, the largest U.S. maker of glass containers for food and beverages. 'We are starting to see the beginnings of a recovery, which we anticipate will extend through 2010 and 2011,' Chief Executive Officer Al Stroucken said in a presentation to investors on March 18. Stroucken said he expects 'volumes to recover due to destocking having run its course.' "
1,"In response to Haiti's devastating earthquake, dozens of immigrant advocacy groups and several members of Congress are renewing a long-standing call for the Obama administration to grant temporary legal status and work permits to as many as 125,000 Haitians in the United States illegally. By law the secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of state, can offer 'temporary protected status,' or TPS, to illegal immigrants of a particular nationality if calamities such as a natural disaster or war make it too burdensome for their home countries to receive them. Immigrants must pay a fee to apply for TPS and are eligible only if they were already in the United States at the time the benefit was offered and if they do not have a criminal record. The status is usually granted for up to 18 months, but the government can, and often does, renew it repeatedly as conditions warrant. Although immigration authorities have halted all deportation flights to Haiti for the time being, there was no word yet on whether TPS would be granted. 'TPS is in the range of considerations we consider in a disaster, but our focus remains on saving lives,' Matthew Chandler, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said Thursday. Supporters of Haitian immigrants have been lobbying for the move since the fall of 2008, after two hurricanes and two tropical storms ravaged Haiti over a four- week period. Within hours of Tuesday's quake, Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Mario Diaz-Balart _ all Republicans from Florida _ sent a letter to President Obama reiterating their plea for TPS for Haitians. 'The combined destruction of today's catastrophic earthquake and the previous storms clearly makes forced repatriation of Haitians hazardous to their safety at this time,' they wrote. 'We strongly believe that it is for such a situation that Congress enacted TPS.' They are among several leaders holding separate news conferences in Miami on Thursday to draw further attention to the issue. Others include the head of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, who will be accompanied by Edwidge Danticat, a celebrated Haitian author and winner of a MacArthur Fellow 'genius' grant. Twenty-six refugee agencies also sent a joint letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Thursday. The U.S. government currently extends TPS to nationals from five countries: El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia and Sudan. However, despite requests by successive Haitian governments, Haitian immigrants have been denied the benefit numerous times during their nation's tumultuous history. Most recently, after the storms of 2008, President George W. Bush's administration suspended deportations for a few months before formally refusing to grant Haitians TPS and resuming repatriation flights. Shortly after Obama took office, his administration informally stopped deporting non-criminal Haitians: According to government statistics, in 2009 only 221 non- criminal Haitians were deported, compared with 1,226 in 2008. (By contrast, the number of Haitians with criminal records who were deported remained roughly the same at 466 in 2009 compared with 428 in 2008.) Homeland security officials were still considering Haiti's request for TPS as part of a larger review of the program when the earthquake hit. Immigrant activists contend that although the informal reprieve from deportation offers some relief to illegal immigrants from Haiti, without the right to work that TPS provides, they are still extremely limited. Allowing such immigrants full access to American jobs could also vastly increase the amount that Haitians are able to send relatives back home at a time when Haiti is in desperate need of cash, said Steve Forester, a Miami-based advocate with the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. 'When somebody works here they can support up to 10 times that number back in Haiti. So we're talking about supporting hundreds of thousands of people in Haiti at no cost to U.S. taxpayers,' Forester said. "

1,"The Afghan government's newly formed peace council wants Saudi Arabia to play a key role in efforts to reconcile with the Taliban and find a political resolution to the war. Qiyamuddin Kashaaf, spokesman for the 70-member High Peace Council, said Thursday that Saudi Arabia would be a good place to hold any formal peace talks that might develop from exploratory discussions the Afghan government is having with some high-ranking members of the Taliban. 'The Muslim Afghan nation wants to bring peace to this country and is asking Islamic countries: 'Help your brothers. It is the responsibility of the Muslim world to respond to this request of the Afghan nation,'' Kashaaf told reporters. He said Saudi King Abdullah should help foster talks if peace negotiations in Afghanistan are not successful. 'We want the Saudi king to help,' Kashaaf said. 'If the two sides cannot make peace, my appeal is for the king to take the lead role in the talks.' Saudi Arabia once had close ties to the Taliban government that emerged victorious from Afghanistan's civil war in the early 1990s. Pakistan gave diplomatic recognition to Taliban rule in May 1997; recognition followed from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last February, Karzai sent a small delegation of former Taliban members to Saudi Arabia to seek help in kick-starting talks with the Taliban. But the Saudis said the kingdom would not help unless the Taliban severed all ties with Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi -- and his al-Qaida terror network. That is also a key demand of both the U.S. and Afghanistan. Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told reporters on Thursday that Pakistan supports an Afghan-led reconciliation process. 'We are working toward that end, and we will continue supporting in whatever way ... the government of Afghanistan wants us to help,' he said. 'We will leave this issue here because it is better not to get into specifics at this stage.' Kashaaf said the council knows the importance of guaranteeing the security of insurgents who want to talk. Gen. David Petraeus, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, has said that the coalition has already helped provide safe passage to insurgent leaders in contact with the Afghan government. NATO officials say there have been contacts with significant leaders of the Taliban, but caution that discussions are preliminary. The Taliban released a statement on Thursday refuting claims that it had sent any delegations for talks with the Afghan government and said it had no intention of negotiating at a time when the country is occupied by foreign troops. As Afghan officials press for peace negotiations, tens of thousands of international forces are simultaneously pushing deeper into Taliban strongholds, especially in the south. The ability of NATO and Afghan forces to take and hold the southern provinces -- and the Afghan government's ability to win the loyalty of citizens away from the Taliban -- is a key test of U.S. President Barack Obama's decision last year to send 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan. It's been unclear over the past few months how effective the southern offensive has been. Residents have reported pockets of stability, but insurgents continue to target government officials and the government has struggled to set up a civilian administration despite NATO backing. A similar operation began in February in the southern, poppy-producing hub of Marjah in neighboring Helmand province has so far failed to completely pacify the area, partly because the military push was not backed by an effective civilian expansion. But Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's half brother and leader of the provincial council, says security is improving in Kandahar and Afghan and coalition forces are chasing the Taliban out of the province. 'There's a lot of progress in security. ... Some (Taliban) were arrested. Some were killed,' Ahmed Wali Karzai said. 'There's no single Taliban base in Kandahar province right now.' He said some insurgents left before military operations began. Government officials will set up institutions in areas cleared of Taliban, he said. Improving residents' quality of life is crucial to winning long-term popular support and maintaining control of territory. In Kandahar city, one resident said people were less afraid now to provide information about insurgents. 'The Taliban are weak now and people are not so afraid of them, so now people can help the government,' said Salam Bacha Barakzai, a 41-year-old teacher. 'You can see that Taliban are being arrested everywhere. That's because the people are helping.' Separately, NATO said a force member was killed following an insurgent attack in eastern Afghanistan Thursday, bringing to 48 the number of NATO troops killed so far this month. Also in eastern Afghanistan, NATO said 17 senior insurgent fighters were captured or killed between Oct. 12 and Oct. 18. In western Paktika province, NATO confirmed Thursday that a man killed in an overnight operation Tuesday was a leader of the Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based Taliban faction closely tied to al-Qaida. The deputy governor of the province, Juma Mohammedi, said the man led a force of around 20 men. And in northern Baghlan province, NATO confirmed a senior Taliban leader was killed by Tuesday airstrike. The man was a district commander for the Taliban, said Mahmoud Akmal , the provincial governor's spokesman. ------ Associated Press Writers Katharine Houreld in Kabul and Mirwais Khan in Kandahar contributed to this report.

1,"AN EDUCATION PG-13, 2009, $28.96; Blu-ray, $38.96 The basics: In this coming-of-age tale set in 1960s Britain, an innocent teen- ager (Carey Mulligan) learns about life the hard way when she falls in love with a handsome older man (Peter Sarsgaard). The lowdown: Screenwriter Nick Hornby and director Lone Scherfig ('Italian for Beginners') adapted Lynn Barber's memoir to create a near-perfect drama that took the top audience prize for foreign film at Sundance last year. And the movie's three Oscar nominations _ Best Actress, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay _ were no fluke: Mulligan shines in this bittersweet drama, which also stars Alfred Molina and Emma Thompson, and Hornby's script is by turns witty and heartfelt. The extras: The special features include your run-of-the-mill interviews with the cast and crew; deleted scenes; and commentary with Scherfig, Mulligan and Sarsgaard. THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY: SEASON ONE Unrated, 2009, $29.95 The basics: The New Jersey version of Bravo's popular reality series, the fourth in the 'Housewives' franchise, follows four Jersey girls who make Carmela Soprano seem downright demure. The lowdown: It's all relative, but these gals are arguably the best and most entertaining of the 'Housewives' bunch. Somehow, even with their big hair and breasts, excessive spending and Botoxed brows, they seem more real than, say, the Orange County crew. Don't miss the episode titled 'The Last Supper,' in which Teresa upends the dinner table, sending the Chianti flying. The third season begins May 3. The extras: The two reunion specials, additional footage, season finale director's cut and an 'Are You a Real Jersey Girl?' quiz. SHERLOCK HOLMES R, 2009, $28.98; Blu-ray, $35.99 The basics: Director Guy Ritchie ('RocknRolla') puts his modern, rough-and- tumble mark on the classic Arthur Conan Doyle tale to mixed effect. The lowdown: Ritchie's approach, which a producer calls 'the Guy Ritchie way _ down and dirty,' may bother purists, but the movie does have genuinely exciting set pieces, and Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of Sherlock, for which he won a Golden Globe, is charmingly off-putting. The extras: A featurette titled 'Sherlock Holmes: Reinvented' includes interviews with the actors, crew and director (Ritchie says he became enamored of the Doyle stories as a young boy in boarding school), and behind-the-scenes footage in the studio and on the London set.

1,"The 'Shahnama' is a terrifying book. Not because it is long, though with 50,000 verses, it is long indeed. Nor because it is dry or taxing on the reader. As translator Dick Davis demonstrated in his 1997 rendering of the 'Shahnama,' or 'Persian Book of Kings,' into English, it is endlessly delightful and readable. But in between its tales of love and betrayal, arrogance and justice, its depiction of mortality and the essence of being is as dark as any existentialist vision of the 20th century. Kings and heroes come forth, strive, fight, conquer and die, and in dying, their lives are snuffed like the punch line to a bad joke. 'He had lived for seven hundred years,' the epic 10th-century poem written by Abolqasem Frowsy says of one of the most magnificent and beneficent of kings. 'But what good is long life, since the world will never reveal her secrets to you?' The small paintings in the Sackler Gallery's exhibition 'Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings' feel like colorful exceptions to the book's endless cycles of generation and decay. But there's no contradiction between their bright colors and often playful rendering of beloved moments in the poem and the Shahnama's larger insistence on the intractable, unknowable veil over life and the meaning of existence. The darkness, in the 'Shahnama,' is all in the interstices, in the silences and moral reflection between the stories. But while the stories are in motion, the book is a brilliant, beguiling display of life. The illustrations gathered by curator Masumeh Farhad date from the 14th to 16th centuries, well after Frowsy wrote his poem late in the culturally brilliant Samanid dynasty. Several visual styles are represented, from 14th-century renderings in which the faces and folds of fabric feel rather like medieval Christian images, to late-15th-century paintings (watercolor, ink and gold on paper) from the Turkoman period, in which the figures are boldly, evenly crudely represented, with large bodies and heads, almost like cartoon characters. But the infinitely detailed and delicate renderings from Tabriz, made around 1520, steal the show. In one Tabriz painting of the hero Rostam discovering his faithful horse Rakhsh, small tufts of grass grow from a blue-gray earth, while horses cavort among flowers, and a wide-eyed mother calmly nurses her eager foal. The hero, one of the most popular figures in the 'Shahnama,' is painted small, low on the page and off to one side, but a strong pattern of diagonal design makes it clear Rostam with his lasso is the focal point of the action. The result is a compelling mix of modesty and centrality, which in some ways is the lesson that almost every king must learn, or risk losing the royal 'farr,' or divine glory, that determines a ruler's fate. A constant inner battle is waged between glory and humility, heroism and service. Rostam will spend his days doing what kings should do: cleaning up the world and rescuing a foolhardy ruler from his own incompetence. In another Tabriz painting, depicting Rostam's father Zal, an albino hero raised from infancy in the nest of a mythical bird known as the simurgh, details of the fantastical creature's feathers are rendered with microscopic precision. The museum provides magnifying glasses, a helpful invitation to look closely at these fantastically delicate images. More odd, and requiring a different sort of visual acuity to detect, are ghostly human faces hidden in the effusions of color that represent mountains. They aren't so much hidden 'Where's Waldo?'-style as integrated into the lines and rhythm of the drawing, as the cartoonist Hirschfeld used to hide the name Nina in his Broadway theater cartoons. The paintings also mimic the descriptive style of the poem, in which people and places are built up from an accumulation of detail, a list of attributes, a collection of finery. In one brief description of a beautiful woman, the poem enumerates musk, gold coins, saffron, rubies, emeralds, Chinese brocade, pearls, turquoise, 'gorgeous cloth,' black curls and 'a paradise of tints and scents.' None of this is surprising in a poem written during a splendid age, in a land crossed and defined by the Silk Road. But this richness of the material, translated into a painting, requires a particular type of looking and appreciation. There's no single, quick grasp of any image. Rather, the surface of the painting stays constantly in the foreground, and what impresses, over time, is the careful, geometric divisions that allow the painter to fill the space with the poem's laundry list of stuff. Sometimes the border of the drawing can contain this overstocked space. But often, as in another Tabriz drawing showing the arrival of a foreign mission to the court of Nurshirvan, the architecture of a palace overwhelms the arbitrary lines of the rectangular border, a tree bursts through the top of the image, and rooms, terraces and towers expand the pictorial space into the terra incognito of the blank page. The images are snapshots of particular moments from the poem; each picture is the poetic narrative itself, the story line that brings the viewer to this particular moment, and then beyond it to the rest of the story. On another level, the beyond seems to be in the images themselves, with their super-fine suggestion of infinite degrees of detail beyond the ability of the naked eye. In that last image, 'The Bier of Iskander,' from around 1330, the great Greek philosopher Aristotle cries over the casket of Alexander (as he's known outside Persia) as if entirely bereft of equanimity and wisdom. The exhibition wall panel recounts for the viewer the relevant passage from Frowsy's poem: 'There is nothing in the world so terrible and fearful as the fact that one comes like the wind and departs as a breath.' That line, and this image, can make you lose your way in the world. Or you can just turn the page and keep reading. - - - 'Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings' is at the Sackler Gallery, 1050 Independence Ave. SW, through April 17. Admission is free.

1,"Consumer confidence rose in January in the United Kingdom although households' inclination to spend fell somewhat, a bank survey said Wednesday. The Nationwide Building Society said its confidence index was up three points to 73, nearly double the level a year ago, when Britain was sliding deeper into recession. January's figure reversed a decline in confidence in December. The index measuring confidence in spending fell from 108 in December to 96 in January. As a measure of the depth of British gloom, the bank's finding that 69 percent of respondents thought the economy was in bad shape represented an improvement over recent months. Britain's recession officially ended in the fourth quarter when the economy grew by just 0.1 percent. 'Positive signs from the manufacturing sector and labor market may have helped boost confidence during January, but confidence is likely to remain fragile for some months to come,' said Martin Gahbauer, Nationwide's chief economist. "
1,"'There'd better be a Four Seasons at the end of this road,' said my friend Rebecca as our rented Kia struggled down a steep hill. (Mental note: Don't take a Kia camping in the mountains.) We'd been going in circles for an hour, taking the wrong exits and searching for signs to our campsite. Alas, there was no Four Seasons at the end of the road. But the accommodations we did find weren't too shabby. Yes, they call it camping, but there was no tent to pitch, no sleeping bag to unroll, no fire to build. At our campsite at Falling Waters Adventure Resort in Bryson City, N.C., eight yurts - insulated circular canvas tents - overlooked Fontana Lake and a pond. Each was furnished with a queen-size bed and a futon and equipped with electricity, a private deck and a skylight for stargazing. And then there was the hot tub a few yards from our yurt. After unloading our bags (mental note No. 2: Don't go camping with a silver Diane von Furstenberg suitcase whose wheels get stuck in the dirt), I climbed into the steaming water to soothe my aching limbs. 'Now, this is my kind of camping,' I thought as I felt my muscles relax. The economy has taken the camp out of camping, making it more appealing to cash- strapped Americans. The new thing is glamping (short for glamour camping), or camping lite. To attract travelers who don't want to sleep on the ground or put up their own shelters, state parks and resorts now offer alternative accommodations: yurts, first used by nomadic Central Asian peoples; tepees; luxury tents; and spruced-up cabins or lodges. To meet a 25 percent increase in demand for its lodges, Kampgrounds of America is adding 400 to KOA campsites, some with flat-screen TVs and fireplaces and all with full kitchens. Camping, said spokeswoman Lacey Thornton, 'doesn't have to be an uncomfortable experience.' The campgrounds themselves offer amenities such as outdoor movies, petting zoos and espresso bars. The luxurious African safari experience was the inspiration behind glamping, but in the United States and Canada, glamping can range from high-end - a luxury one-bedroom tent at the Resort at Paws Up in Montana, for instance, will run you $725 a night in the fall - to comfy for both body and wallet: A two-bed tepee at the Wigwam Village Inn in Cave City, Ky., costs from $60 to $65 a night. _ _ _ I didn't do much camping growing up in Queens. In fact, I'd been camping only once, with relatives in Wisconsin when I was 13. My mother had forced me into it, and my only memory of it was fighting off mosquitoes. Rebecca, a Jersey girl, also had limited camping experience. Now here we were, in our 30s, two city slickers willing to relive our teenage camping days, but not so much that we would give up the comforts of home. Falling Waters, right up against the Tennessee border in North Carolina, is known for its comfortable yurts and abundance of outdoor activities. We'd snaked through the Great Smoky Mountains to get there, marveling at the beautiful tapestry of trees and feeling the stress of the city melt away. Near our camp, we saw a sign for Nantahala Village, which advertised a day spa. ('Spa!' we exclaimed in unison.) There was also a restaurant and a general store. It was good to know we would have easy access to modern-day comforts. The bed in our one-room yurt was swathed in pillows and a tasteful caramel- colored comforter. Rugs covered the pine floor. There was a ceiling fan, but we never needed it: A nice mountain breeze blew in through the three windows and the skylight. A small fridge held bottled water, and there was a coffee maker. Nearby was a CD player. Each yurt had a theme: safari, country, orchard and so on. We'd chosen Yurt 5, which was named the Lake Yurt, though it turned out to be on a small pond. Really it seemed more country; there was a cowboy hat hanging on one wall and a statue of a cowboy on a bookshelf. The lampshades and tables reminded me of the furniture you can buy at World Market. Call it World Market chic. The one drawback: We didn't have our own bathroom. But there were shared locking bathrooms a few yards away, each with a shower and plenty of toiletries. On my way there before bed, I noticed that three late-night revelers had taken over the hot tub. Exhausted after the nine-hour drive from Washington, we locked our French doors and got into bed, the sound of crickets lulling us to sleep. Yurt sweet yurt. _ _ _ We were up by 7:30 a.m. and set off on a morning hike, taking one of the two trails that started near the stairs to Yurt 7, the Waterfall Yurt. We suffered a spasm of yurt envy, seeing the occupants drinking coffee on their deck while gazing out at the mountains. (Our pond view wasn't nearly so spectacular.) We hiked down the steep trail, climbing over fallen tree limbs, not knowing exactly where we were heading. 'This is going to be a pain going up,' Rebecca said. The hike was worth it once we reached Fontana Lake. With the trees reflected in the water, it looked like a scene Bob Ross would have painted in 'The Joy of Painting.' Then a speedboat raced by, creating waves that distorted the trees' reflection. It was hypnotic. We retraced our steps to Yurt 7 (yes, it was a pain going up) and searched for the waterfall trail. A sign warned: 'Danger. Cliffs Ahead. Stay on the path.' I led Rebecca down another steep hill to what I thought was the waterfall trail. Little did I know that I was leading her off the path. We could hear the waterfall. We just couldn't find it. We did find Colleen McDaniel and Jamieson Lee, the occupants of Yurt 7, who had decamped from their deck and were building a fire in a pit near their yurt to cook breakfast. Colleen and Jamieson are regular campers, as we could tell by the ease with which they were snapping branches and creating flames, something Rebecca and I would never attempt to do. (We drove into Bryson City and got bagel sandwiches at a cafe.) But on this trip, they hadn't wanted 'the hassle of building a tent,' Colleen said. 'It's nice to have a roof over your head, with nice sheets.' Amen to that. We resumed our search for the waterfall, making our way down a steep trail, holding on to trees to keep from falling, and finally arrived at a deck overlooking a pretty, though not very big, waterfall. Because water was the camp's big draw, we signed up for a speedboat ride on Fontana Lake. Nick Williams, owner of Smoky Mountain Jet Boats, drove the neon green boat very slowly at first, telling us that the lake is drained by about 50 feet every year to prevent flooding. He pointed to Clingman's Dome, the third- highest point on the East Coast, and suggested that we hike Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi. Then he said, 'I think we're warmed up enough,' and hit the accelerator. We raced around the lake, Nick occasionally spinning the boat around as water splashed all over us. He showed us Bird Falls, which made the waterfall we had hiked to look like the drip from a faucet. Then we entered the beautiful Nantahala River Gorge. After a few more spins, including one during which it looked as if we might hit a tree, Nick took us on 'the real estate portion' of the tour, pointing out some of the most prized lakefront houses. Rebecca and I headed next to Smokemont Riding Stables in the nearby town of Cherokee, stopping first for some shopping downtown. (We were glamping, after all.) At the stable, Ray Cook helped us onto our mounts. Mine was Pearl, a 16-year-old with an independent streak. 'Pearl does anything she wants to do,' Ray said. Rebecca got Taywah, also in his teens, who stopped whenever the terrain got rough. 'Taywah is the lazy one,' Ray explained. We crossed over old Highway 441, forded a small river, then rode up and down hills beneath a mesmerizing canopy of trees. It would have been relaxing had Pearl not stopped to graze on leaves every few minutes. And at one point, Taywah decided to give Rebecca a good scare by taking off at a run. 'Pearl is hungry, and Taywah is done,' Rebecca said. Back at our yurt, we got ready to grill burgers. But our grill looked nothing like mine at home, where all I have to do is open my propane tank and turn a knob. I hadn't even thought to pick up charcoal or lighter fluid. We had exhausted our camping abilities and headed back into Bryson City for some Mexican fare. Like Taywah, we were done. "
1,"Poles voted Sunday in local elections that appeared to reward the government's go-slow approach in trimming the welfare state in the EU's largest new member -- the only one in Europe to avoid a recession. An exit poll released after polls closed Sunday showed the governing party of Civic Platform won nearly 34 percent of votes in provincial assemblies, followed by 27 percent for the country's main opposition party, Law and Justice. Runoff elections in two weeks are still needed to determine the outcome in several mayoral races. The poll, carried out by the TNS OBOP polling agency, showed the opposition party Democratic Left Alliance winning nearly 16 percent and the Polish People's Party -- the junior partner in the government -- with 13 percent. The poll, published by the TVN24 station, gave no margin of error. The results underline the continued popularity of the governing Civic Platform party and its leader, Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The team has a pro-business philosophy and has privatized some state-run enterprises during its three years at the helm, but overall has not met its promise to trim back the welfare state significantly. That hesitancy seems to have bolstered the government's popularity because it means Poland has avoided painful cuts during the global economic crisis, also boding well for Civic Platform in national elections next year. Poland's economy slowed during the financial crisis but the nation was the only one in Europe to avoid a recession, another factor which has given Tusk's governing team a boost. However, the budget deficit has grown, prompting the government to plan an unpopular 1 percentage point increase in the value added tax to 23 percent on many goods and services. Due to Europe's economic turmoil and the growing deficit, the government also has postponed plans to adopt the euro currency. Though many business owners favor the currency change, many Poles oppose it because they fear it will lead to a rise in prices. The exit polls underline the secondary role still held by the main opposition group, Law and Justice. The conservative and nationalist party was founded by the late President Lech Kaczynski -- who was killed in a plane crash this year -- and his twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who remains its leader. Kaczynski has clashed with some of his closest party supporters in recent weeks. He has expelled two close aides, and several others have left in protest. The turmoil appears to have weakened the party's support somewhat but not crippled it. Compared to the last national elections in 2007, which brought Tusk to power, both parties have lost some support. In that vote, Civic Platform won 42 percent and Law and Justice 32 percent. A national election for parliament must be held by late 2011, but no date has been set. "
1,"Federal Reserve officials are more confident the U.S. economy is moving toward self-sustaining growth, giving urgency to discussions about the tactics and timing of an exit from record-low interest rates. Kansas City Fed Bank President Thomas Hoenig said Jan. 11 the central bank should end purchases of mortgage-backed securities because the market is 'healing.' Philadelphia Fed Bank President Charles Plosser said the next day that the recovery is 'sustainable even as the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs eventually wind down.' Policy makers are still studying ways to drain $1 trillion in excess cash from the financial system and debating how to signal a rate increase that economists say is at least 10 months away. The first test of their exit strategy will come in March, when the Fed's purchases of $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities are scheduled to end. 'They'll tell themselves the unusual support is no longer necessary, the recovery is self-sustaining,' said Vincent Reinhart, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who served as director of the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs under Chairman Ben Bernanke. 'Deep down, they probably also believe they have the option of starting up again.' A government report Thursday showed business inventories rose more than forecast in November as companies tried to keep up with a jump in sales. Fed officials are watching to see if inventory restocking sparks gains in jobs and incomes that will boost spending, leading to further increases in hiring. The Fed will keep its target for overnight lending among banks unchanged through September and raise it by half a point in the fourth quarter, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Policy makers, who have kept the benchmark rate near zero since December 2008, next meet Jan. 26-27. The world's largest economy will expand 2.7 percent this year, the best performance in four years, the Bloomberg survey showed. Consumer purchases will grow 2 percent, up from a December estimate of 1.8 percent and the first gain since 2007, according to the median forecast of 60 economists. Macroeconomic Advisors, a St. Louis-based forecasting firm, says the economy probably expanded at a 5.5 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, the fastest in more than five years. Demand will be partly driven by business investment and exports, their forecast shows. Consumption should be supported by household wealth as stocks climb and housing prices steady. The Standard and Poor's 500 Index is up 36 percent over the past year. 'The drag on consumer spending from rapid declines in wealth has gone away,' said Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors. 'Demand will pick up.' Reports Friday indicated the recovery is being sustained into 2010 without generating inflation. Industrial production climbed 0.6 percent in December, the sixth straight increase, the Fed said. Consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month, less than forecast by economists, according to the Labor Department. The Fed's Beige Book business survey released Jan. 13 signaled the recovery is broadening, with 10 of the Fed's 12 district banks reporting an improvement last month. Home sales increased toward the end of last year in most Fed districts, the report showed, and manufacturing improved or held steady while the labor market and loan demand remained weak. Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities have helped stabilize the housing market, which was at the epicenter of the financial crisis, by pushing down borrowing costs for home buyers. Government tax credits also helped propel existing home sales to the highest level in almost three years in November. Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities are near the lowest relative to Treasuries in nearly two decades. Central bankers, like private economists, expect some increase in mortgage rates as purchases of securities tail off. 'As our agency mortgage-backed securities purchases come to an end, we'll probably see a little bit of upward pressure on interest rates,' New York Fed President William Dudley said on Jan. 13 in an interview with PBS Television's Nightly Business Report. 'But there's a big debate about whether they'll be small or medium or large. So I think we'll have to wait and see.' Job growth 'will not likely be rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate,' Fed Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said in a speech on Jan. 8. 'This should allow for accommodative monetary policy to continue to support the economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes self-sustaining.' Rosengren like Hoenig is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year. Retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent in December, a Commerce Department report showed Thursday. After-tax personal income adjusted for inflation was up 1.5 percent in the year ended in November, compared with an average 3.3 percent gain in the decade before the recession. 'Short-term rates are going to stay low for a considerable period of time,' the New York Fed's Dudley said Jan. 13. The policy of keeping borrowing costs low could remain in place 'at least six months,' Dudley said. 'It could be a year from now, two years from now. It's going to depend on how the economy develops.' With assistance from Carlos Torres, Alex Tanzi, Bob Willis, Vincent del Giudice, Courtney Schlisserman and Scott Lanman in Washington. "
1,"Euan Nisbet, a University of London earth sciences professor who has traveled the world testing the air for greenhouse-gas pollution, makes his way to a rocky outcropping on Hong Kong Island. He takes out a pump connected to a thin tube and a plastic bag to capture traces of the wind. 'This is a good day for collecting samples,' says Nisbet, looking out to sea. 'There's a good, strong breeze blowing in from the mainland. It's the breath of China.' Nisbet says the world puts too much faith in government estimates of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases blamed for climate change. Companies and countries base emissions calculations on the raw materials that go into a factory or power plant; they don't check the pollution that comes out. 'It's like going on a diet without weighing yourself,' explains Ray Weiss, a geochemistry professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. 'We're counting all the calories, believing the bottom-up calculations are right and not making any effort to test by getting on the scale.' As the world turns to climate treaties and emissions- trading markets to tame global warming, scientists and regulators are clashing over a key question: How do we measure the pollution we're trying to reduce? Companies use bottom-up calculations and report their emissions estimates based on inputs: how much coal a plant burns or how much oil a factory consumes. Countries tabulate these estimates and add such nationwide figures as vehicles and even methane-belching sheep within their borders. Nisbet, Weiss and other researchers say this bottom-up approach doesn't reveal what's happening in the air. They're sounding an alarm that greenhouse gases measured in the atmosphere can be double estimates on the ground. In the case of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), countries report that output has plummeted since 1995 based on counts of equipment and other things that can release the gas. Scientists say measuring the air shows levels have surged since at least 2000. Getting the measurements right is crucial because SF6 traps 23,900 times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide and lingers for up to 3,200 years, the Environmental Protection Agency says. 'These gases lead to climate change for centuries or millennia, so there's a finite amount you can ever put in the atmosphere,' says Stephen Pacala, director of Princeton University's environmental institute. 'For every release, you're taking something from some subsequent person.' Making sure the numbers add up is important for a more immediate reason: They underpin the only international climate treaty that sets mandatory limits for greenhouse gases. That 192-country pact, known as the Kyoto Protocol, set emissions targets for 38 of the countries that signed on. This year, nations will gather in Cancun, Mexico, beginning Nov. 29 for annual United Nations-led climate talks. Today, $141 billion worth of credits that help countries meet their Kyoto goals are changing hands in global emissions markets. And business is booming in offsets -- the right for countries and companies that still pollute too much to claim credit for green projects elsewhere. These efforts are based on bottom-up calculations being accurate. 'We have to get the emissions numbers right early on,' says Shakeb Afsah, a former World Bank environmental economist who founded Performeks. 'We've seen how the cumulative effect of small errors that accumulated in the financial markets have blown up as little cracks turned into fault lines.' Traders and regulators say Europe's carbon market, called the Emissions Trading System, and the United Nations' offset market, called the Clean Development Mechanism, are making a dent in greenhouse emissions. The global carbon market may surge to as much as $1.4 trillion worth of transactions by decade's end, Bloomberg New Energy Finance says. The 15 countries that were European Union members at the time Kyoto was adopted say they've surpassed their goal of trimming emissions in the five years to 2012 by an average of 8 percent compared with 1990 levels. As of 2008, the now 27-nation EU reported to the United Nations that emissions had dropped 11.3 percent below 1990 amounts. Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice chairman of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says companies and countries use tried-and-true formulas to calculate emissions. 'Burning 1 kilogram of carbon is going to provide 3.7 kilograms of CO2; that's the law of chemistry,' van Ypersele says. 'As long as you know how much carbon is present in the fossil fuel you burn, you automatically know the amount of CO2.' If there are discrepancies between emissions reduction figures, it may be because countries that calculate them don't all follow one set of rules, van Ypersele says. The Kyoto Protocol requires just 38 developed countries to submit emissions numbers using stringent guidelines. The United States has refused to ratify Kyoto. And fast-growing polluters including China and India can use looser calculations that aren't audited. 'That's not a technical problem,' van Ypersele says. 'It's a political problem.' Nisbet says bottom-up calculations have one big selling point: They're consistent. Measuring the air isn't as precise or as easy. 'You don't always get the same result,' he says. 'But it's what's really there. It's there because we can measure it.' --With assistance from Ewa Krukowska in Brussels and John Duce in Hong Kong. Adapted from Bloomberg Markets magazine. "
1,"Air New Zealand said Tuesday it will set a new benchmark for longhaul flights by offering beds in economy class, but they come with a catch -- passengers need to buy three seats to enjoy lie-down travel. The airline's 'Skycouch' will use three economy seats that unfold to create a space where children can play or people can relax and sleep, airline chief executive Rob Fyfe said. The Skycouch is aimed at couples and families, and will be the price of about two and a half seats. 'For those who choose, the days of sitting in economy and yearning to lie down and sleep are gone,' Fyfe told reporters. 'The dream is now a reality, one that you can even share with a traveling companion -- just keep your clothes on thanks.' Developed in-house by Air New Zealand designers and engineers, Fyfe said the Skycouch represents the first real improvement in comfort for economy travelers in more than 20 years and would help the airline set a new benchmark for international travel. To create the bed, leg rests rise up to fill the space between rows of seats. A thin mattress is placed on top and full size pillows are provided. The result is a level bed across three seats, though it is not completely even due to the seat contours. About a quarter of all longhaul economy seats will convert to Skycouches, taking up the first 11 rows in the economy cabin of the airline's new Boeing 777-300 planes. Passengers will pay the standard economy fare for two seats and receive the middle seat for about half price. Presuming it's a couple that buys the seat, the total amounts to about 7,600 New Zealand dollars ($5,420) per person for a return flight to London. Single passengers in business class lie-flat seats pay nearly $7,140 for the London flight, for example. A single premium economy seat that does not recline to a bed costs nearly $4,300. Air New Zealand was rescued from bankruptcy by a billion-dollar government financial package in September 2001 that left the government owning 75 percent of the national carrier. "
1,"'We have a tsunami coming at us, and we're sitting in a rowboat,' says neurologist Richard Mayeux of New York's Columbia University. The surge that worries Mayeux is Alzheimer's disease: In 2050, 13.5 million Americans may have it, at an annual health-care cost of more than $1 trillion, according to the Alzheimer's Association. 'Alzheimer's could bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid,' says Howard Fillit of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. The impending epidemic, combined with emerging technologies, is driving a transformation in the fight against the disease: Instead of beginning treatment after symptoms appear, the idea is to detect and respond to the disease in the earliest, previously undetectable stages, before it can irretrievably ravage the brain. Researchers say that, based on current estimates of life expectancy, delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by an average of five years could reduce the number of patients by half. 'People take Lipitor because it lowers the risk of heart disease. We want to find the same thing for Alzheimer's,' Mayeux says. The new approach is made possible by recently developed methods to detect and measure Alzheimer's biomarkers, the biological indicators of the disease. New brain-scanning techniques, tests for 'suspect' genes and measures of certain telltale proteins in spinal fluid probably won't benefit patients for years, but they're giving researchers a more sophisticated picture of the disease's pathology. At the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, researchers Eric Reiman and Pierre Tariot are leading the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative, a collaborative effort by scientists, academics and the pharmaceutical industry. 'We want to help launch the era of Alzheimer's prevention research,' Reiman says. 'It's a true collaboration between stakeholders, the people afflicted, the families and people at risk.' The institute is developing two studies, to begin in 2012, that will treat apparently healthy people who show the highest genetic risk for developing the disease. 'They will be more or less free of symptoms when we begin,' Tariot says. The researchers will use brain imaging and cognitive tests to track the impact of experimental drugs. 'The hypothesis is that if we give pre-symptomatic people these treatments we should be able to see some evidence of the effects,' Tariot says. One study, to take place in the region around Medellin, Colombia, will focus on 2,000 members of 25 extended families who share a common ancestry and whose members carry a gene that leads some to develop Alzheimer's while they're still in their 40s. Though early-onset Alzheimer's is rare, the underlying mechanisms are thought to be quite similar to those that appear when the disease typically emerges, usually in the 70s and 80s. For the second study, to be conducted in the United States, researchers will screen 50,000 people ages 60 to 80 to see if they carry two copies of a gene, ApoE4, that evidence suggests is linked to Alzheimer's. Of those who do, Reiman expects 400 to be enrolled in the study. Half the participants in each study will receive an experimental drug and half will receive placebos; then they will be monitored for two years. If the drug doesn't seem to have a protective effect, the investigators will try another drug, looking for one to help prevent onset. Reiman says they have not yet decided which drugs will be tested. Giving experimental therapies to healthy people raises ethical questions. But researchers, physicians and pharmaceutical executives say the urgency of the problem justifies taking a certain amount of risk, which they will disclose to everyone participating in the studies. 'We need to be able to say, `Here is what we know and here is what we don't know about this drug,' ' Tariot says. New brain-imaging technologies will help the researchers evaluate the drugs' efficacy. For example, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals of Philadelphia has developed a new dye, AV45, that binds with amyloid proteins, which create the plaques in the brain that are Alzheimer's hallmarks. The dye makes the plaques visible on a PET scan. 'This is a compound that sees amyloid in the brain,' says Michael Weiner of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, who was not involved with the dye's development but intends to use it in future studies. 'Another way of saying it is that it sees Alzheimer's in the brain.' Before the advent of amyloid imaging technologies, the only way to see amyloid plaques and therefore obtain a definitive Alzheimer's diagnosis was to do an autopsy after the patient died. To date, remedies for Alzheimer's remain frustratingly limited. Once Alzheimer's symptoms appear, the disease has already disrupted the brain's communication system of neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters. The drugs so far approved by the Food and Drug Administration don't cure Alzheimer's; they only treat the symptoms and are effective for a few years, if at all. Some patients report improved memory and cognitive function with the treatments; others see no improvement. More than 150 Alzheimer's drugs are in development. As enthusiastic as researchers are, they face a long road. Even if they determine which biomarkers are best at predicting the disease and discover drugs that slow the progress of those biomarkers, there's no guarantee that the drugs will arrest the cognitive decline. Recent experimental drugs have been effective in removing amyloid from patients' brains, for example, but produced no change in their symptoms. That has fueled debate whether the telltale amyloid plaques may be only a sign of the underlying disease, not its cause. 'Amyloid plaques may be like gravestones that signify the end stage of the disease,' Tariot says. 'The toxicity may have occurred long before the plaques appear.' 'Creating knowledge is a long way from making drugs,' acknowledges Fillit of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, which invests in start-up biotech firms, existing companies and academic research. It can cost $1.2 billion to bring a new drug to market, Fillit says. 'We give this money for a very specific purpose, and we want specific milestones,' Fillit said. 'The only way out of this conundrum is to find new drugs.' In a report last year, the Alzheimer's Study Group, a panel co-chaired by former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former senator Bob Kerrey, warned that the Alzheimer's epidemic will progress like the disease itself: slowly. But if we ignore it, the group said, it could have the same disastrous consequences as ignoring the levees in New Orleans or looking the other way as subprime loans subverted the financial system. The convergence of technological innovation and an enormous population at risk has made Alzheimer's a higher national priority for researchers. 'We're excited about this change of momentum,' Tariot said. 'We've captured people's imagination and attention.'

1,"Peter Hessler, a modern Marco Polo crossing China in a rented Jeep Cherokee, has witnessed signs and wonders worthy of a Coen brothers film. He's seen a camel hitched to a plow, a hotel lobby with a bowling alley, and miles of empty highway stretching across a barren landscape. These images surface in 'Country Driving,' Hessler's amiable journey through the vanishing villages and booming factory towns of a country where everyone seems in a hurry because everything is changing so fast. 'To drive across China was to find yourself in the middle of the largest migration in human history -- nearly one-tenth of the population was on the road, finding new lives away from home,' says Hessler, a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine. The social upheaval gives Hessler an edge. With so many people on the move and so much in flux, strangers strike up conversations with ease, offering insights into whether the 21st century really does belong to China. Hessler gives rides to small-town sophisticates hitchhiking in fresh makeup on dirt roads. He observes a demolition team flattening an inconvenient mountain. He watches two businessmen design a factory on a piece of crumpled paper. It takes them one hour and four minutes. Their only tools: disposable lighters for their smokes. In a sense, everyone in this capitalist experiment is an outsider; everyone is displaced. Hessler fits in. 'Are you Mongolian?' a hitcher asks as they bang down a rutted road. Hessler comes from Missouri. He arrived in China as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1996, and before long began crisscrossing the land by bus and boat, plane and train. In 2001, he acquired a Chinese driver's license and set out to explore how automobiles and road building were transforming the nation. Part travelogue, part investigation, 'Country Driving' is three books in one. The first describes trips that take him from Beijing to the Tibetan Plateau. With no obvious route across the West shown on his Sinomaps, he follows the crenellated lines marking the Great Wall. His progress is slowed by roads ending in washouts and peasants who use highways to thresh grain. It's illegal yet tolerated, and farmers grow impatient with squeamish drivers. 'Go, go, go!' they shout when Hessler hesitates to roll over food. 'And so I went -- millet, sorghum and wheat cracking beneath me.' Moving with ease across the steppes, Hessler flouts the rules, driving the rented Jeep out of Beijing and not applying for permission to travel around. He takes a tent to avoid small-town hotels, which hand guest lists to the cops, and the authorities hardly hinder him. In one town, he pays a fine of about $12 and drives away. 'In China, much of life involves skirting regulations,' he says, 'and one of the basic truths is that forgiveness comes easier than permission.' In the second book, Hessler rents a home in a mountain village north of Beijing and records how the arrival of a paved road turns the town into a tourist destination. This story swings to the rhythm of the seasons, as Hessler joins a grave-sweeping ceremony in April and helps harvest walnuts in September. He becomes close enough to one couple to help save their kindergartner from a rare blood disorder -- rushing the boy to a hospital, seeking a diagnosis from doctor friends, paying a stack of cash for a transfusion. That story, like others here, first appeared in the New Yorker. By 2005, Hessler was thinking less about China's past and more about its future. So he heads to southern Zhejiang Province to seek a city destined to bristle with factories once an expressway is built. He finds it in Lishui, where he meets two men setting up a plant to produce the nylon-coated steel rings used in adjusting brassiere straps. Hessler traces their progress, opening a window on migrant workers, technology theft and how cities buy rural land rights out from under farmers and resell them as urban development rights, pocketing massive profits. Though Hessler succeeds in bringing the story to life, a cookie-cutter industrial town lacks the pungency of rural China. So he spices the narrative with sometimes irksome digressions on peripheral characters, including a shabby acrobatic troupe whose act includes two girls -- one fat, one thin -- dancing in bras, panties and white bobby socks. Don't let that deter you. Every so often, I read a book that upends my perceptions about a place. This is one of them. 'Country Driving: A Journey Through China From Farm to Factory' is published by Harper (438 pages, $27.99). James Pressley writes for Bloomberg News. "
1,"BP said Friday it will close its solar-panel manufacturing plant in Maryland, the final step in moving its solar business out of the United States to facilities in China, India and other countries. Just 3 1/2 years ago, in an announcement widely hailed by Maryland officials and promoters of 'green jobs,' BP unveiled a $70 million plan to double output at the facility in Frederick and erected a building to house the production lines. But on Friday the company said it would lay off 320 workers and keep only a hundred people involved in research, sales and project development. BP said laid-off employees would receive full pay and benefits for three months, followed by severance packages and job-placement assistance. The company, unable to sell or lease the building, will tear it down. 'We remain absolutely committed to solar,' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said in an interview Friday. But he said BP was 'moving to where we can manufacture cheaply.' The company said in a news release that by closing down high-cost manufacturing locations, BP slashed unit costs by more than 45 percent. BP, which has been in the solar business for 37 years, acquired a half-interest in the Frederick plant when it bought Amoco Corp. in 1999; it bought the rest from Enron. At one point, BP was the world's second-largest solar company. Today, it ranks in the top 15. Intense competition and high silicon prices made the solar sector 'a very challenging business,' Hayward said. Reyad Fezzani, chief executive of BP Solar, said that the U.S. market, which grew 87 percent in 2008, was almost flat in 2009, with prices for solar modules tumbling about 50 percent. BP also has made missteps. It was producing 125-millimeter multi-crystalline solar cells in Frederick while the rest of the industry had moved to 156-millimeter cells, which have become standard. Changing the production lines would be too expensive, Fezzani said. Elsewhere in the United States, BP built and then closed two plants using technologies that the company said had showed early promise. 'They were very experimental. And those factories weren't successful in making commercial products,' Fezzani said. Anticipating renewed growth in the U.S. market, other companies _ including Yingli Solar of China, Schott Solar of Germany, and Kyocera Solar of Japan _ are planning to open facilities in the United States. But BP plans to rely on a 25-year-old joint venture with Tata in Bangalore, India, and on an eight-year-old joint venture in Xian, China, with a Chinese firm called SunOasis. BP buys silicon from a variety of suppliers and uses contract factories in which it holds no interest. BP Solar said in January that Jabil Circuit would build a module assembly plant in Chihuahua, Mexico, to serve the U.S. market. BP has applied to the Energy Department to help finance a proposed 32 megawatt solar-power generation plant on Long Island, N.Y., on land belonging to the Energy Department's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Sensitive to questions about whether U.S. tax dollars would be helping foreign manufacturers, Fezzani said that '70 percent of our jobs are outside the factory,' in design, construction, installation and maintenance. He said BP recently certified 150 installers, 'all small businesses.' "
1,"European air traffic from Scotland to Scandinavia and the Netherlands was disrupted by volcanic ash spreading from Iceland, shutting airports and prompting British Airways to suspend all domestic flights. Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports were closed on advice from British air traffic control, and all London airports were likely to shut down at midday, according to airport operator BA Ltd. Oslo closed its Gardamoen airport outside the Norwegian capital and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport canceled dozens of flights. 'Volcanic ash represents a significant safety threat to aircraft,' Taylor Samuelson, a spokeswoman for the British National Air Traffic Services, said in a statement. The number of flights allowed to enter British airspace had been limited because of the cloud of ash, she said. The volcanic eruption in Iceland is the second in four weeks and prompted the evacuation of the nearby area by more than 800 people as water levels in rivers rose by almost three feet. Iceland straddles mid-Atlantic tectonic plates, making the island of about 300,000 residents geologically active. Volcanic ash can disrupt flights because of the potential risk of engine malfunction and impairment of cabin air quality. "
1,"Sebastien Loeb of France won the Rally Bulgaria on Sunday to clinch his fourth victory in this season's world championship. The reigning six-time world champion led the 354-kilometer all-asphalt rally from beginning to end and finished 29.5 seconds ahead of his Spanish teammate Dani Sordo, who was second in a Citroen C4 car. The final day saw a tense battle for second between Sordo and Petter Solberg of Norway, who was also driving a Citroen. Solberg finished third, 6.8 seconds behind Sordo. French driver Sebastien Ogier finished in fourth place to secure the leading four positions for Citroen -- the best world championship result for a carmaker since Toyota posted a similar result at the 1993 Safari Rally. Finnish pair Mikko Hirvonen and Jari-Matti Latvala, who were both driving a Ford Focus, came in fifth and sixth respectively Loeb's victory saw him extend his lead in the overall standings. "

1,"Fettuccine With Sausage, Sweet Onion and Spinach 4 servings By using only a small amount of sausage, I take advantage of the flavor it brings without loading this pasta with fat and sodium. To finish the dish, baby spinach is stirred in at the last minute. It adds a bright, fresh flavor, color and more vegetable goodness. Ingredients 8 ounces dried fettuccine 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces sweet Italian sausage (casings removed) 1 large sweet onion, cut into thin slices (2 cups) 1/8 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 large red bell pepper, roasted and cut into 2-inch strips (see NOTE; may substitute 3/4 cup sliced jarred roasted red peppers) 4 ounces baby spinach 3/4 cup low-sodium or homemade chicken broth Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional) Steps Line a plate with a few layers of paper towels. Cook the fettuccine according to the package directions. Drain. While the pasta cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, shallow braising pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, breaking up any large clumps; cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until it is no longer pink. Use a slotted spoon to transfer it to the paper-towel-lined plate to drain and cool. Reduce the heat to medium; add the onion to the pan or skillet; season with the salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until the onion has softened. Add the roasted bell pepper strips, spinach and broth. Use your fingers to crumble the sausage into the mixture. Increase the heat to medium- high; cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring, until the spinach wilts and the ingredients are well combined. Add the cooked pasta and the remaining tablespoon of oil; toss to combine. Taste, and adjust the seasoning as needed. Serve, passing the grated Parmesan cheese on the side, if desired. NOTE: To roast the bell pepper, place it on a piece of aluminum foil under the broiler, about 4 inches from the flame. Let the pepper become blistered and charred on one side, then rotate so a new side is exposed. Continue until most of the skin is charred. Don't worry if the pepper loses its form. Place the peppers in a resealable plastic bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let sit for 15 minutes. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, discard the skin, stem and seeds.

1,"The doctor whose research linking autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella influenced millions of parents to refuse the shot for their children was banned Monday from practicing medicine in his native Britain. Dr. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study was discredited -- but vaccination rates have never fully recovered and he continues to enjoy a vocal following, helped in the U.S. by endorsements from celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy Wakefield was the first researcher to publish a peer-reviewed study suggesting a connection between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Legions of parents abandoned the vaccine, leading to a resurgence of measles in Western countries where it had been mostly stamped out. There are outbreaks across Europe every year and sporadic outbreaks in the U.S. 'That is Andrew Wakefield's legacy,' said Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 'The hospitalizations and deaths of children from measles who could have easily avoided the disease.' Wakefield's discredited theories had a tremendous impact in the U.S., Offit said, adding: 'He gave heft to the notion that vaccines in general cause autism.' In Britain, Wakefield's research led to a huge decline in the number of children receiving the MMR vaccine: from 95 percent in 1995 -- enough to prevent measles outbreaks -- to 50 percent in parts of London in the early 2000s. Rates have begun to recover, though not enough to prevent outbreaks. In 2006, a 13-year-old boy became the first person to die from measles in Britain in 14 years. 'The false suggestion of a link between autism and the MMR vaccine has done untold damage to the UK vaccination program,' said Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. 'Overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe.' On Monday, Britain's General Medical Council, which licenses and oversees doctors, found Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct and stripped him of the right to practice medicine in the U.K. Wakefield said he plans to appeal the ruling, which takes effect within 28 days. The council was acting on a finding in January that Wakefield and two other doctors showed a 'callous disregard' for the children in their study, published in 1998 in the medical journal Lancet. The medical body said Wakefield took blood samples from children at his son's birthday party, paying them 5 pounds (about $7.20) each and later joked about the incident. The study has since been widely rejected. From 1998-2004, studies in journals including the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, Pediatrics and BMJ published papers showing no link between autism and the measles vaccine. Wakefield moved to the U.S. in 2004 and set up an autism research center in Austin, Texas, where he gained a wide following despite being unlicensed as a doctor there and facing skepticism from the medical community. He quit earlier this year. Offit said he doubted Britain's decision to strip the 53-year-old Wakefield of his medical license would convince many parents that vaccines are safe. 'He's become almost like a Christ-like figure and it doesn't matter that science has proven him wrong,' Offit said. 'He is a hero for parents who think no one else is listening to them.' Wakefield told The Associated Press Monday's decision was a sad day for British medicine. 'None of this alters the fact that vaccines can cause autism,' he said. 'These parents are not going away; the children are not going to go away and I most certainly am not going away,' he said on NBC's 'Today Show.' Wakefield claimed the U.S. government has been settling cases of vaccine-induced autism since 1991. However, two rulings by a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in March and last year found no link between vaccines and autism. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation for children they claim were hurt by the vaccine. Wakefield has won support from parents suspicious of vaccines, including Hollywood celebrities. McCarthy, who has an autistic son, issued a statement in February with then boyfriend Carrey asserting Wakefield was 'being vilified through a well-orchestrated smear campaign.' 'It is our most sincere belief that Dr. Wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers,' the actors said. McCarthy, whose best-seller 'Louder Than Words' details her search for treatments for her son Evan, wrote the foreword for a new book by Wakefield about autism and vaccines. In Monday's ruling, the medical council said Wakefield abused his position as a doctor and 'brought the medical profession into disrepute.' At the time of his study, Wakefield was working as a gastroenterologist at London's Royal Free Hospital and did not have approval for the research. The study suggested autistic children had a bowel disease and raised the possibility of a link between autism and vaccines. He had also been paid to advise lawyers representing parents who believed their children had been hurt by the MMR vaccine. Ten of the study's authors later renounced its conclusions and it was retracted by the Lancet in February. At least a dozen British medical associations, including the Royal College of Physicians, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust have issued statements verifying the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. This verdict is not about (the measles) vaccine,' said Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol Medical School. 'We all now know that the vaccine is remarkably safe and enormously effective... We badly need to put this right for the sake of our own children and children worldwide.' ------ Associated Press Writer Kelley Shannon contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. ------ Online: Ruling on Wakefield, http://www.gmc-uk.org/Wakefield--SPM--and(un ers core)SANCTION.pdf(underscore)32595267.pdf "
1,"Chris Dudley, a journeyman center during his pro basketball career, may have to retire the underdog image if Oregon makes him its first Republican governor in 23 years. Dudley, 45, a 6-foot-11 wealth manager who has never run for office, is nearly even in polls with former Democratic governor John Kitzhaber, 63, who was an emergency- room doctor before entering politics. While Democrats have held the state's top job for six straight terms, Dudley's almost 2- to-1 money advantage may help him pull off a coup, said Portland-based independent pollster Mike Riley. 'There is likely to be an upset, and it will be the biggest seismic change in Oregon politics in the last quarter century,' Paul Gronke, a Democrat and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, said in a telephone interview. 'Our fiscal crisis trumps everything.' President Barack Obama travels to Oregon Wednesday to campaign for Kitzhaber, who served two terms as governor. Republicans may gain at least eight governorships in the Nov. 2 election, giving them 37 out of 50, and are challenging for House and Senate majorities. The recession, bank bailouts and trillion-dollar health-care legislation are sapping energy from Obama's party, with Republican candidates vowing to reduce the size and reach of government. Oregon suffers from 'runaway state government spending' and 'lack of fiscal management,' Dudley says in a position paper on his website. He would stop routine budget increases and set up a team to review fiscal assumptions and conduct regular audits, according to the paper. He also proposes that employees pay for a larger portion of their health-care costs, and would end the state monopoly on liquor sales. Oregon has 10.6 percent unemployment, a point higher than the national average, and more than 200,000 citizens out of work. The state faces a deficit of more than $14 billion over a decade at its current service level, according to the office of Democratic Gov. Ted Kulongoski, who cannot run again because of term limits. Schools, prisons, colleges and health coverage are all set for cuts, according a June report from the governor. 'Beginning next February and March, people will see almost daily stories about programs disappearing and very hard choices,' said John Tapogna, president of consulting firm ECONorthwest in Portland. Dudley decided to run after a career as a rare Ivy Leaguer in the National Basketball Association. He's remembered as much for his struggle with free throws (46 percent average versus last year's NBA-wide average of 76 percent) as his workmanlike rebounding (5,457, compared with record-holder Wilt Chamberlain's 23,924). Dudley also built a reputation off the court through his charity work and youth basketball camp. He was diagnosed at 16 with Type 1 diabetes and runs the Chris Dudley Foundation, which provides information and resources to help those with the disease. 'Dudley is fresh, young and interesting,' Gronke said. 'He's portraying the image of a centrist Republican, not conservative socially, that harkens back to the Republicans in Oregon in the '70s and '80s.' Dudley hasn't been associated with the tea party movement and his stands on social issues fit with Oregon's libertarian tradition, said Gronke. The candidate's proposals are tired Republican themes, Kitzhaber said during a Sept. 30 debate. 'He's a new face, but it's the same old ideas,' said Kitzhaber, who was governor from 1995 until 2003. Dudley doesn't have enough experience for tough times, he said. During a recent stop at a Portland machine factory, Dudley spoke to about 40 employees, some in jeans flecked with metal shavings, on a floor the size of two football fields. 'We're not living up to our potential,' said Dudley. He said he wanted to revive a state once known for fiscal restraint and moderate politics and blessed with natural beauty. 'I don't think that's too much to ask,' he said. Dudley and Kitzhaber were tied last week in a Rasmussen Reports and Survey USA polls and in a forecast by FiveThirtyEight, a New York Times political blog. The Cook Political Report rates the race a tossup. Dudley had a $7.7 million to $4 million money advantage over Kitzhaber as of Oct. 15, and the support of 12 percent of Democratic voters in the most recent Riley Research survey. The Republican Governors Association gave him $250,000 in July and $500,000 in August, according to the group's Internal Revenue Service filings. 'It's a fight to the finish,' said Riley, the Portland pollster. With assistance from Brendan McGrail and William Selway. "
1,"Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder David Beckham said that a loan move back to AC Milan is 95 percent done after helping England beat Belarus 3-0 on Wednesday. His chances of going to a fourth World Cup is dependent on him joining a top European club on loan in January during Major League Soccer's offseason. 'It's close,' Beckham said after being named man of the match, despite only coming on for a little over 30 minutes as a second-half substitute. 'I've always said I want to go back there if they want me. AC Milan have said they wanted me back since I left to go back to the United States and they're saying the same now,' the former England captain said. 'It's 95 percent done so I don't know why it wouldn't happen now.' And the 34-year-old Beckham showed with his first touch at Wembley Stadium why England coach Fabio Capello persists in selecting him and plans to take him to the World Cup. Beckham came on after 58 minutes and sent a short corner to Shaun Wright Phillips on the edge of a crowded penalty area to score England's second goal against Belarus in the team's last competitive match before the World Cup. 'We all have to prove with every game and every training session that we want to be in the squad for every game,' Beckham said. 'Not just the World Cup, but every qualifier and every time we meet up.' "
1,"An extensive Pentagon report about the armed forces' attitudes toward gays in the military gives a boost to the stalled push by President Barack Obama to repeal the 17-year-old 'don't ask, don't tell' law, undercutting arguments by Republicans and others that such a change would unduly strain the armed forces. After nine months of study and unprecedented polling of the nation's troops, the Pentagon concluded Tuesday that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly posed a 'low risk' of disruption. The report found that a large majority of troops were comfortable with the prospect of overturning long-standing restrictions on gays in uniform and that they expected it would have little or no effect on their units. 'This can be done, and should be done, without posing a serious risk to military readiness,' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said. He urged the Senate to pass legislation before it adjourns this month and a new Congress - in which the GOP will hold much more sway - is seated in January. Senate Democrats are pressing to move fast and have scheduled hearings starting Thursday. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has vowed to hold a vote on the bill this month, but whether he'll be successful is an open question. 'The report is common sense,' Reid said Tuesday. 'It's no surprise to me. It's no surprise to the American people.' The bill's fate rests largely on the votes of about 10 moderate senators of both parties who are waiting to read the report before making their decision. Already Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have said they will vote to end the ban if Democrats permit a fair debate. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said ending the ban 'doesn't have to be done during the lame-duck session.' Obama also asked the Senate to vote soon, 'so I can sign this repeal into law this year and ensure that Americans who are willing to risk their lives for their country are treated fairly and equally.' On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee will question Gates; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the report's co-authors, Army Gen. Carter Ham and Pentagon counsel Jeh Johnson. On Friday, the committee will ask the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the commandants of the Coast Guard and Marine Corps, to express their personal views - which do not necessarily match up with the Obama administration's position. The panel's ranking Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, is a lead critic of efforts to repeal the ban. He did not comment Tuesday on the report. Gates acknowledged Tuesday that military leaders of the individual branches of the armed services are 'less sanguine' about the need to end the ban. The joint chiefs met with Obama at the White House on Monday to discuss the report. They have also written letters to Gates expressing their views on the study's findings. Pentagon officials declined to make the letters public. Regardless of the top brass's skepticism, 'this report is going to be perhaps the most effective lobbying tool that repeal advocates will have over the next two weeks in the Senate,' said Aubrey Sarvis, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a group pushing to end the ban. 'We recognize that there will be some initial resistance from some of the chiefs, but at the end of the day, they have all said that if Congress acts, they will salute and implement this change.' Military leaders have emphasized that they will obey the law, regardless if Congress changes it. But conflicts between personal beliefs and professional obligation have led to awkward moments for military leaders. Gates, who has long said that he supports Obama's desire to change the policy, shed more light on his personal opinion Tuesday. 'We spend a lot of time in the military talking about integrity and honor and values,' he said in response to reporters' questions. 'One of the things that is most important to me is personal integrity, and a policy or a law that in effect requires people to lie gives me a problem.' Legislation pending in the Senate states that the Defense Department would not have to end 'don't ask, don't tell' until it certifies to the White House that the military is ready to do so. It's unclear whether that would take months or even years; Gates and other military and defense officials dodged questions Tuesday about how long the department would need. 'The president would be watching very closely to ensure that we don't dawdle or slow roll this,' Gates said. At the same time, he said his 'greatest fear' is that federal courts might intervene and overturn the law immediately, forcing the Pentagon to adapt overnight. The 362-page report - based largely on survey responses from 115,000 members of the military - concludes that 'the risk of repeal of don't ask, don't tell to overall military effectiveness is low.' While ending the ban would probably bring about 'limited and isolated disruption' to unit cohesion and retention, 'we do not believe this disruption will be widespread or long-lasting,' it stated. The survey found that 69 percent of respondents said they had served with someone in their unit who they believed to be gay or lesbian. Of those who did, 92 percent stated that their unit's ability to work together was very good, good, or neither good nor poor, the report said. Combat units reported similar responses, with 89 percent of Army combat units and 84 percent of Marine combat units saying they had good or neutral experiences working with gays and lesbians. At the same time, the survey found that 30 percent of respondents over all - and between 40 and 60 percent of the Marine Corps - either expressed concern or predicted a negative reaction if Congress were to repeal the law. Those concerns are 'driven by misperceptions and stereotypes about what it would mean if gay service members were allowed to be 'open' about their sexual orientation,' Johnson and Ham concluded in the report. Such concerns are 'exaggerated, and not consistent with the reported experiences of many service members,' they said. About 28 percent of the 400,000 active-duty and reserve troops who received copies of the survey responded, the report said. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point. Even if the bill clears the Senate this month, it must be reconsidered by the House, which passed a similar version in May. Rep. Howard McKeon of California, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday that he also wants his panel to hear from top military leaders. Scheduling conflicts are likely to prohibit the committee from holding hearings, said a spokeswoman for the panel's chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo. Opponents of lifting the ban said lawmakers should not vote before the end of the year. 'This entire exercise has been done to lend support to the president's political exercises,' said Elaine Donnelly, executive director of the Center for Military Readiness. Her group is preparing a report card on the report that will score its factual accuracy, whether it fairly included the viewpoints of concerned troops and how Johnson and Ham reached their conclusions. Lawmakers should take as long as necessary to review it, she said. Staff writer Ben Pershing contributed to this report. "
1,Barbados international and former Millwall forward Paul Ifill will miss six weeks of Australian football's A-League after suffering a serious leg injury while playing for Wellington against Newcastle. Scans showed Ifill suffered a high ankle strain during Wellington's 4-0 win over Newcastle on Saturday. Ifill is Wellington's leading goal scorer this season with seven goals. Ifill played 230 matches for Millwall and played for both Sheffield United and Crystal Palace before joining Wellington last year. 
1,"U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the nations fighting in Afghanistan have until roughly the end of this year to show the war is turning around. Otherwise, Gates says, people in the United States and elsewhere won't support the effort. He says war commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal is confident he can show progress in that time. Gates spoke in London following strategy sessions with the United States' closest ally in Afghanistan. Public support for the eight-year war is dropping in both the U.S. and Britain. "
1,"Lately, a handful of new discoveries make it seem more likely that we are not alone -- that there is life somewhere else in the universe. In the past several days, scientists have reported there are three times as many stars as they previously thought. Another group of researchers discovered a microbe can live on arsenic, expanding our understanding of how life can thrive under the harshest environments. And earlier this year, astronomers for the first time said they'd found a potentially habitable planet. 'The evidence is just getting stronger and stronger,' said Carl Pilcher, director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which studies the origins, evolution and possibilities of life in the universe. 'I think anybody looking at this evidence is going to say, 'There's got to be life out there.'' A caveat: Since much of this research is new, scientists are still debating how solid the conclusions are. Another reason to not get too excited is that the search for life starts small -- microscopically small -- and then looks to evolution for more. The first signs of life elsewhere are more likely to be closer to slime mold than to ET. It can evolve from there. Scientists have an equation that calculates the odds of civilized life on another planet. But much of it includes factors that are pure guesswork on less-than-astronomical factors, such as the likelihood of the evolution of intelligence and how long civilizations last. Stripped to its simplistic core -- with the requirement for intelligence and civilization removed -- the calculations hinge on two basic factors: How many places out there can support life? And how hard is it for life to take root? What last week's findings did was both increase the number of potential homes for life and broaden the definition of what life is. That means the probability for alien life is higher than ever before, agree 10 scientists interviewed by The Associated Press. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in California, ticks off the astronomical findings about planet abundance and Earthbound discoveries about life's hardiness. 'All of these have gone in the direction of encouraging life out there and they didn't have to.' Scientists who looked for life were once dismissed as working on the fringes of science. Now, Shostak said, it's the other way around. He said that given the mounting evidence, to believe now that Earth is the only place harboring life is essentially like believing in miracles. 'And astronomers tend not to believe in miracles.' Astronomers, however, do believe in proof. They don't have proof of life yet. There's no green alien or even a bacterium that scientists can point to and say it's alive and alien. Even that arsenic-munching microbe discovered in Mono Lake in California isn't truly alien. It was manipulated in the lab. But, says NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, who has worked on searches for life on Mars and extreme places on Earth, 'There are real things we can point to and show that being optimistic about life elsewhere is not silly.' First, there's the basic question of where such life might exist. Until a few years ago, astronomers thought life was only likely to be found on or around planets circling stars like our sun. So that's where the search of life focused -- on stars like ours. That left out the universe's most common stars: red dwarfs, which are smaller than our sun and dimmer. Up to 90 percent of the stars in the universe are red dwarf stars. And astronomers assumed planets circling them would be devoid of life. But three years ago, NASA got the top experts in the field together. They crunched numbers and realized that life could exist on planets orbiting red dwarfs. The planets would have to be closer to their star and wouldn't rotate as quickly as Earth. The scientists considered habitability and found conditions near these small stars wouldn't be similar to Earth but would still be acceptable for life. That didn't just open up billions of new worlds, but many, many times that. Last week, a Yale University astronomer said he estimates there are 300 sextillion stars -- triple the previous number. Lisa Kaltenegger of Harvard University says scientists now believe that as many as half the stars in our galaxy have planets that are two to 10 times the size of Earth -- 'super Earths' which might sustain life. Then the question is how many of those are in the so-called Goldilocks zone -- not too hot, not too cold. The discovery of such a planet was announced in April, although some scientists are challenging that. The other half of the equation is: How likely is life? Over the past decade and a half, scientists have found Earth life growing in acid, in Antarctica and other extreme environments. But nothing topped last week's news of a lake bacterium that scientists could train to thrive on arsenic instead of phosphorous. Six major elements have long been considered essential for life -- carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. This changed that definition of life. By making life more likely in extreme places, it increases the number of planets that are potential homes for life, said Kaltenegger, who also works at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington, is less optimistic because he believes what's likely to be out there is not going to be easy to find -- or that meaningful. If it's out there, he said, it's likely microbes that can't be seen easily from great distances. Also, the different geologic and atmospheric forces on planets may keep life from evolving into something complex or intelligent, he said. If life is going to be found, Mars is the most likely candidate. And any life is probably underground where there is water, astronomers say. Other possibilities include Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan. There's also a chance that a telescope could spot a planet with an atmosphere that suggests photosynthesis is occurring, Kaltenegger said. And then there's the possibility of finding alien life on Earth, perhaps in a meteorite, or something with an entirely different set of DNA. And finally, advanced aliens could find us or we could hear their radio transmissions, McKay said. That's what the SETI Institute is about, listening for intelligent life. That's where Shostak puts his money behind his optimism. At his public lectures, Shostak bets a cup of coffee for everyone in the audience that scientists will find proof of alien life by about 2026. The odds, he figures, have never been more in his favor. ------ Online: NASA Astrobiology Institute: http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ SETI Institute: http://www.seti.org/ "
1,"Christmas is upon us, and for a top ballerina at New York City Ballet, that means one sure thing: suiting up in tulle and sequins as the Sugarplum Fairy in the annual classic, 'The Nutcracker.' What Jenifer Ringer surely didn't expect was to be accused of having 'eaten one sugarplum too many.' That remark two weeks ago by America's most prominent dance critic reverberated across the Web, with many coming to Ringer's defense and calling the reviewer a cad. Even worse, angry fans wrote on chat boards, Ringer has been public about struggles with eating disorders earlier in her career, over which she triumphed to become one of NYCB's most popular dancers. How cruel, then, to criticize her body now. Through two weeks of chatter, though, Ringer remained publicly silent, as most dancers do -- until Monday, when she appeared on NBC's 'Today' to address the controversy swirling around her like the confetti in 'Nutcracker's' famous snowflake scene. 'I'm not overweight,' said the ballerina, who at 37 is not only a company veteran but one of only three mothers in its ranks. 'I do have, I guess, a more womanly type than the stereotypical ballerina.' But she declined to demand an apology from New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay. 'It's his opinion,' said Ringer, whom NYCB would not make available to The Associated Press for comment. 'He is a critic and he's paid to put his opinion in the paper.' She added that 'there were 2,000 people probably out there ... and everyone else had a different opinion as well.' Amid the kerfuffle over whether and when a dancer's weight becomes an issue lies an even more basic question about ballet, an art form in which the body is subjected to untold rigors -- not to mention the constant threat of injury -- in order to fulfill its strict, time-honored requirements. Are different body types allowed? Must one be rail-thin to qualify as a top dancer? To longtime observer Wendy Perron, editor of Dance Magazine, the answer is no. 'Perhaps she is not the thinnest dancer on the stage, but who cares?' Perron said in an interview. 'What she has is warmth. She is just wonderful in the role of the Sugarplum Fairy, welcoming Marie and her prince to the Land of the Sweets. Not every dancer can pull that off.' Indeed, one imagines that Ringer's proficiency in the role is what led NYCB head Peter Martins to cast her in the opening night of 'Nutcracker' this season, one of only two performances to which critics are invited. (Martins, too, was unavailable for comment.) Yet Macaulay wrote: 'This didn't feel, however, like an opening night. Jenifer Ringer, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, looked as if she'd eaten one sugar plum too many; and Jared Angle, as the Cavalier, seems to have been sampling half the Sweet realm.' Interestingly, the criticism of Angle has not drawn nearly as much attention. Nor has Macaulay's other comment about the couple, that they lacked 'adult depth and complexity.' But fans thought there was something particularly cruel about the weight comment, probably because body type is one thing, as NYCB principal dancer Wendy Whelan puts it, that you can't do anything about. 'It's just unfair when somebody criticizes a part of you that you can't change,' said Whelan, also one of the company's most popular and admired dancers, in a phone interview. 'Jenifer has always looked like that. I think she's absolutely gorgeous! She's one of my favorite dancers in the world. And when I watch her dance, my eye doesn't see anything wrong with it.' The New York Times said Macaulay was not available for comment, and that a critic's reviews stand for themselves. Macaulay did publish a follow-up column to answer criticism of his comments on Ringer several days later. Noting that one reader had called his review appalling, heartbreaking, childish, hurtful and incompetent all at once, he wrote: 'If you want to make your appearance irrelevant to criticism, do not choose ballet as a career. The body in ballet becomes a subject of the keenest observation and the most intense discussion. I am severe -- but ballet, as dancers know, is more so.' That position did not sit well with many -- especially those who are familiar with eating disorders. 'His comment was just below the belt,' said Dr. Katharine Halmi, a specialist in eating disorders at Weill Cornell Medical College. 'It's well established that dancers are at a tremendous risk for eating disorders. Ballet companies are just now dealing with it. So this is really bad.' As Ringer herself pointed out, one of the things many people admire about NYCB is that it celebrates different body types. 'We have every body type you can imagine,' she said on 'Today.' 'We have tall, we have petite, we have athletic, we have womanly, we have waif-like, we have every body type out there, and they can all dance like crazy and they're all gorgeous.' "
1,"Hungary's government says it will sell 230 communist-era relics including a life-size bust of Vladimir Lenin at an auction to benefit people affected by last month's red sludge flood. State Secretary Bence Retvari says the objects, also including paintings in the Socialist Realism style and photographs of Hungary's communist-era leaders, were found in state warehouses 'where they have been gathering dust for the past 20 years.' Retvari said Monday the auction will be held Dec. 6 and revenues will be given to Caritas, a Catholic charity, to help residents in several towns in western Hungary which were hit on Oct. 4 by a flood of toxic red sludge from a broken reservoir at an aluminum plant. Ten people died in the flooding and dozens were injured. "
1,"Politicians prefer elections that produce real majorities and clear mandates. One lesson from the messy outcome of Britain's just-concluded general election is that politicians should never underestimate the power of voters to disappoint them. The outcome here has produced something rare. Forced by the failure of any party to win a majority of seats in the next Parliament, negotiations are underway here exploring whether it will be possible for some combination of the parties to govern cooperatively in difficult times. That's currently unthinkable in the America's winner-take-all political culture. But there is enough evidence that the voters in the United States lack full confidence in either political party to warrant closely watching what will play out here in the coming days and months. All three major parties in Britain _ Labor, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats _ emerged from Thursday's election feeling let down. As a result, the country has been plunged into a period of extraordinary uncertainty. No hanging chads, but a hung Parliament, as it's called. The visual images across London Saturday displayed the uncertainty. Politicians have been shuttling between meetings. A group of demonstrators took to the streets calling for electoral reform. Round-the-clock coverage keeps everyone abreast of any developments. Most extraordinary was the side-by-side appearance of the three major party leaders at a ceremony commemorating the 65th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe _ which symbolized more than anything else the fact that no one knows who will lead Britain. How did it get to this point? Voters on Thursday dealt a huge blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Labor Party, which has been in power since 1997. Labor lost 97 seats in the carnage of the voting, its worst losses in 80 years. Its share of the vote fell to 29 percent, the lowest since the humiliation of 1983, when Labor won just 27 percent. But voters were not prepared to fully embrace the Conservatives. Although they gained 91 seats, the Tories fell 20 seats short of the 326 seats needed to claim a majority in the new Parliament. Six months ago, polls suggested that the Conservatives would easily win enough seats to install David Cameron as the next prime minister. Now Cameron is trying to broker a deal to make it possible for him to enter No. 10 Downing St. as prime minister amid recriminations inside his party over why he and his team could not win a majority against an opponent as unpopular as Brown. The most disappointed, however, may be the Liberal Democrats and their leader, Nick Clegg. Thanks to the charismatic Clegg's performance in the first nationally televised candidate debates in Britain's history, the Liberal Democrats saw a surge in their support in the weeks before the election. Clegg called on voters to usher in an era of new politics. For a time, it looked like Liberal Democrats could push Labor into third place in the popular vote. The party also appeared likely to expand its share of seats in Parliament significantly. Instead, the roof caved in on Election Day. Clegg's party actually lost five seats. Still, the results have put Clegg in the powerful but awkward position of playing kingmaker. More than anyone else right now, Clegg has the greatest potential to name the next prime minister. Clegg had said the party with the most votes and the most seats deserved the right to try to form a government. For now, the serious negotiations are between Cameron's Conservatives and Clegg's Liberal Democrats. The path is treacherous for both sides. Cameron and Clegg are being tugged and pulled between the electorate's apparent desire for governing in the national interest and their activists' fears that the leaders will compromise too much. That tension is something that is familiar on both sides of the Atlantic. Philip Stevens, a columnist for the Financial Times, noted Saturday that the voters' desire for change and 'palpable disenchantment' with the old politics produced the inconclusive outcome of Thursday's balloting. 'This demands something of the nation's politicians with which they are largely unfamiliar: a grasp of the national interest that reaches beyond the reflex to grab the spoils of office,' he wrote. For Cameron, still the most likely person to become the next prime minister, this is a terribly difficult moment. One alternative is for the Conservatives to attempt to govern as a minority party, though with some assurances from the Liberal Democrats that they will not try to bring down the government on key votes in return for some nods to their own priorities. On Friday, Cameron appeared interested in seeking something broader, an agreement that would put the two parties into a more formal arrangement. That could give the new government greater stability as it attempts to deal with a major budgetary problem. But Cameron faces resistance within his ranks from those who fear he already has abandoned principle in trying to modernize his party _ the same sentiment expressed by some conservative activists in the United States about some Republican politicians. Clegg, whose party won almost a quarter of the vote but just less than 10 percent of the seats in Parliament, faces similar pressures from his activists and some fellow members of Parliament, for whom a major overhaul of the electoral system is of paramount importance. Brown made an expansive public offer to Clegg on Friday, promising a referendum on electoral reform. His hope of Labor staying in power is that there will be a breakdown in the current negotiations that would drive the Liberal Democrats into the arms of Labor, although the price might be Brown's resignation. No matter the outcome, it is possible that the new government will be so shaky that Britain will face another election in less than a year. Such is the fluidity of politics here this weekend. In Washington, the weight remains with the politicians and activists who prefer confrontation to cooperation, as the polarized debate over health care underscored. Politicians willing to work with the other side do so at their own risk. The new bipartisan debt commission operates in an environment in which neither Republicans nor Democrats on the panel can be confident of support from either elected officials or their parties' rank and file. The current harmonious Senate floor debate over financial regulatory reform is more a function of the politics of the issue _ nobody wants to appear against taking on the banks _ than of a change in the partisan atmosphere. The United States has not reached Britain's current moment and, because the systems are so different, may never. But the November elections could produce an American equivalent: a Republican House and a Democratic White House. That would put the same pressure on President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress that Britain's political leaders are feeling this weekend _ caught between the national interest and partisan demands from their wings for a no- compromise stance. British politicians will have to resolve their problems first, but Democrats and Republicans may find their day is coming soon. "
1,"South Africa ended its four-game losing streak in the Tri-Nations with a 44-31 win over Australia in a pulsating nine-try encounter on Saturday. Victor Matfield celebrated victory in his 100th test at his home ground of Loftus Versfeld when winger JP Pietersen ran in the Springboks' fifth try with two minutes remaining to seal victory. 'I've had an unbelievable career and to reach 100 caps at Loftus Versfeld is wonderful,' the 33-year-old Matfield said. 'These fans are my people and I want to say thank you very much.' Australia, which has never won at Loftus Versfeld and hasn't won at a highveld venue since 1963, led 14-0 and 21-7 early in the first half before the hosts fought back to go ahead for the first time in the 50th minute. Forwards Juan Smith, Gurthro Steenkamp and Pierre Spies and recalled fullback Francois Steyn also scored tries for South Africa. Australia had two tries from James O'Connor and one from Will Genia and Dean Mumm. Pietersen made sure of South Africa's first win of its Tri-Nations campaign when Matfield and center Jean de Villiers moved the ball quickly to the right winger, who sprinted home in the dying minutes. 'A lot can happen in a week,' said South Africa captain John Smit, whose 100th test ended in a dramatic defeat to New Zealand last weekend. 'I am really happy with the boys. We needed a win today ... or a bit of Prozac. 'A start like that is something we want to scratch out pretty quickly, but the boys stuck to their task. This crowd was unbelievable and it was well deserved for a big hero like Victor (Matfield).' South Africa flyhalf Morne Steyn kicked six from six attempts at goal. Australia center Matt Giteau landed four conversions and a penalty. The Wallabies stunned the Pretoria crowd as they raced out of the blocks with tries to Genia and O'Connor for a 14-0 lead in the first five minutes. O'Connor grabbed his second after a terrible mistake from opposite winger Bryan Habana and Mumm benefited from a quick tap from fullback Kurtley Beale to earn the Australians a bonus point for four tries in just 26 minutes. But South Africa began to claw its way back into the match through flanker Smith, prop Steenkamp and No. 8 Spies. Steenkamp's try, driving through the Australian forwards from a lineout, was the fifth of the match in less than 15 minutes. The Springboks then cranked up the pressure in the second half to outscore the tiring Australians 20-3 at the high-altitude stadium and continue Australia's miserable record at Loftus. The Aussies have now lost five from five in Pretoria. 'It was obviously a game we could have won,' said Australia coach Robbie Deans. 'We went missing when it really mattered.' 'We got restricted in the second half and it cost us,' Wallaby skipper Rocky Elsom said. 'It was moving so fast that whoever was able to hold onto the ball was going to win and we weren't able to do that. 'We took a few of our chances and the guys were definitely on task. We just came up a little bit short at the end.' Powerful play from Wallabies lock Nathan Sharpe at a five-meter scrum had set up Genia, the scrumhalf slipping through attempted tackles from Matfield and De Villiers to score inside three minutes. Australia's quick start continued when Beale broke the length of the pitch and found captain Elsom in support. Elsom was brought down close to the tryline but Genia retrieved possession and sent a short pass for O'Connor to slip over. The stunned Springboks regained their composure from a scrum in the Australian 22-meter area. An inside pass from livewire scrumhalf Francois Hougaard saw Smith stride in between the posts. O'Connor ran in his second when Habana dropped Quade Cooper's kickoff. But South Africa came back again, making use of Steyn's penalty kick for the corner when Steenkamp powered over. Steyn kicked the conversion from out wide and then added a monstrous 57-meter penalty in the 20th to close the gap to 21-17. Australia continued with its fast-paced, expansive game, turning over possession deep in its own half soon after and finding the dangerous Mitchell in space on the left wing. His kick was gathered by Habana but the Springbok wing gave away a penalty under pressure in front of his own posts, and a quick tap from Beale set up Mumm for Australia's fourth in the 26th. Five minutes later, the home team hit back again when a break from Hougaard created space for Spies and he powered free to dive over under the bar. Australia led 28-24 at halftime but Steyn added a second penalty to close the gap to a point in the 47th. However, Giteau replied immediately with his first penalty goal. South Africa went ahead for the first time after Danie Rossouw claimed possession from the kickoff and South Africa piled forward. The Boks hammered away until Morne Steyn darted for the line and sent a pass over his shoulder that fell for namesake Francois Steyn to score in the corner. Morne Steyn extended his kicking return to six from six at his home ground to push South Africa 34-31 ahead. Australia soon threatened through Mitchell, who was stopped a meter short on the left wing. The Wallabies then moved the ball quickly to the right but Adam Ashley-Cooper was denied by a try-saving tackle from man of the match Hougaard. With Morne Steyn substituted, Francois Steyn landed a long-range penalty to extend South Africa's lead to 37-31 and, under pressure from the Australians in the final stages, South Africa finally broke away to send Pietersen clear. South Africa coach Peter de Villiers said: 'I was worried when we gave them those tries. It took a lot of heart and a lot of character to come back and win a game like this. 'The guys knew they messed up the first half. But heart is what this team is all about.' ------ Scores: South Africa 44 (Juan Smith, Gurthro Steenkamp, Pierre Spies, Francois Steyn, JP Pietersen tries; Morne Steyn 2 penalties, 4 conversions; Francois Steyn penalty; Butch James conversion) def. Australia 31 (James O'Connor 2, Will Genia, Dean Mumm tries; Matt Giteau penalty, 4 conversions). HT: 24-28. "
1,"A former senator with close political ties to President Alvaro Uribe was arrested by Colombian authorities Wednesday on charges of colluding with far-right death squads. Mario Uribe, a second cousin to the president, is one of the most prominent figures in a scandal that has sent dozens of current or former lawmakers to jail on charges of benefiting from links to outlawed rightist paramilitary groups. Under an order handed down by Colombia's Supreme Court, Uribe was arrested in the city of Medellin, 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of Bogota, police said. He was to be transferred to the capital. The 60-year-old former senator has denied any wrongdoing. Uribe, who presided over the Senate in 2000-2001, is a close confidant of Colombia's conservative president. The two launched a political party together in the mid-1980s and have remained allies ever since. The arrest stems from allegations by a former paramilitary leader that Uribe conspired with right-wing militias in the 1990s to gain control of land in northeastern Colombia's agriculturally rich regions where paramilitaries controlled large swaths of territory. The former paramilitary leader, Jairo Castillo, alias 'Pitirri,' claims he witnessed a meeting during which Uribe negotiated a deal with paramilitary leaders to obtain prime cropland. Paramilitary groups formed in the 1980s to defend wealthy ranchers from kidnapping and extortion by Colombia's leftist rebels, but evolved into drug-trafficking criminal mafias. Prosecutors blame them for at least 10,000 murders and the theft of millions of acres of land. Uribe was imprisoned for four months in 2008 on charges of colluding with paramilitaries, but he was released in August of the same year after Colombia's No. 2 prosecutor said there was insufficient evidence to hold him. He remained under investigation, however, and was barred from leaving the country. "
1,"Cool rain forests store more carbon per acre than tropical rainforests, according to a new book that synthesizes the work of 30 international scientists, a finding that could shift the way policymakers approach climate policy. 'Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World: Ecology and Conservation' documents that in 2007 the 250 million acres of temperate and northern forests stored 196 gigatons of carbon - the equivalent of six times the amount of carbon dioxide humans emit each year by burning fossil fuels. With the world's climate negotiators poised to meet in United Nations-sponsored talks in Cancun at the end of the month, the book's editor, Dominick DellaSala, said policymakers need to focus on 'the world's forgotten rain forests.' Tropical rain forests get between 60 and 160 inches of rain a year; temperate and boreal forests receive between 40 and 100 inches of rain annually but stay much cooler, with average annual temperatures between 43 and 52 degrees Fahrenheit. Cool rainforests are found in 10 regions of the world, including the Pacific Northwest; inland British Columbia and parts of Idaho and Montana; Eastern Russia and Southern Siberia; and Chile and Argentina. 'In some regions, like portions of Europe, nearly all rain forests are gone while others are headed in that direction if we don't act soon,' said DellaSala, president of the Geos Institute. 'Decades of logging have created a national ecological debt crisis that is being passed on to future generations from which we are borrowing on their biological inheritance.' These cooler rain forests store carbon in the massive trunks of their trees, as well as in their dense soil and foliage. Old-growth temperate forests, DellaSalla said, store more carbon per acre than any other kind of forest in the world. Excerpted from washingtonpost.com/postcarbon "
1,"The races for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cup went to the wire Thursday, with no candidate having a lock on the vote of the FIFA executive committee. Capping three days of intense lobbying, British Prime Minister David Cameron was at the center of a smooth final presentation for England. It stood in sharp contrast with the overly long show of Spain-Portugal to sway the 22 FIFA voters for the 2018 tournament. Russia was already hurt by the no-show of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and it seemed unlikely the quirky, fun presentation of Belgium-Netherlands could do much to change their status as outsider. The five bidders for 2022, Qatar, the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea, had their presentations on Wednesday. The members of FIFA's executive committee opened their secret voting session on the bids in early afternoon, leaving much of the world in suspense. As much as the bids covered all corners of the globe, so different were the final presentations, with England's bid standing out with a mix of princely and football royalty, from Prince William to David Beckham. 'I know that we can deliver extraordinary public occasions and celebrations,' Prince William said. 'I certainly hope so as I'm planning quite a big one myself next year,' he said, referring to his upcoming marriage to Kate Middleton. The show was as much as could be expected to boost England's chances but the presentations were only a concluding half hour following years of intense lobbying. If England's contribution looked great to the world at large, all that is really needed to host the event is the sympathy, and vote, of the majority among 22 men. Spain-Portugal indirectly target England when it highlighted the corruption allegations against FIFA officials that surfaced in the British media over the past month. 'FIFA is a clean institution. FIFA works honestly,' bid president Angel Maria Villar said. 'You are all honest, hardworking people.' Spain-Portugal's presentation ran well over time and often seemed awkward. Although the bid has kept a near invisible profile, centering on behind-the-scenes lobbying only, it still kept Spain-Portugal as England's main challenger. After arriving in Zurich strongly favored to win, Russian bid officials spent much time on damage control. Putin had long been touted as the captain of the bid, but it was left to national team captain Andrei Arshavin and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva to provide some glamor to the presentation. Throwing all of her fire and emotion into the presentation, Isinbayeva focused her pale blue eyes on the voters in the room and said with utter conviction 'I love football.' Instead, Belgium-Netherlands took a different approach. Meeting a key demand of FIFA, the leaders of the two nations gave guarantees of full cooperation if their joint bid wins. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that the two governments 'can fulfill all of FIFA's needs and at the same time host a wonderful tournament.' In a FIFA assessment of the bid two weeks ago, the organization complained that the necessary government support was still lacking. As an underdog with little to lose, the Belgium-Netherlands presentation was far from conventional. It mixed footage of old interviews with updated voice-overs -- a quirky trick making it seem that the joint bid has been destined to win since Johan Cruyff's heyday as a player in the 1970s. "
1,"Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel has set the fastest time in Friday's practice ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix. With the Red Bull cars needing to finish ahead of their Brawn GP rivals Sunday to keep interest in the Formula One championship, Vettel set a best time of 1 minute, 48.650 seconds at the Marina Bay circuit. Renault driver Fernando Alonso, who won the race last year, was second fastest, ahead of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen and Nick Heidfeld of BMW. Championship leader Jenson Button of Brawn was fifth best, a place ahead of Red Bull driver Mark Webber, whose second practice session was curtailed by a crash into a wall. Brawn driver Rubens Barrichello was 11th. "
1,"On the second anniversary of the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it's now obvious that weak lending standards, serving the political interest of affordable housing for all, were the main reason for the nation's mortgage meltdown. But the government just can't permit lending to anyone and everyone; it must insist on prudent judgment about who will repay and who will default. Not only will borrowers who lack a down payment, steady income, employment and a good credit history probably get into trouble -- surprise! -- but too much irresponsible lending also creates artificial demand for houses, driving prices into the stratosphere and, as we have just experienced, puts all homeowners at risk. The same mistake occurred in 1929, when any investor could buy stocks on margin with as little as 10 percent down. Small wonder that after the crash the government instituted a margin requirement of 50 percent down. Congress should apply the same principle to housing purchases, increasing the amount a buyer must put down and other safeguards to assure prudent lending. Congress refuses to do this. Why? Giving citizens cheap, easy housing is a great way to win votes, no matter what horrific repercussions ensue. Consider the prevailing narrative that holds a greed-driven private sector responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. A secondary narrative points to a greed-driven Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac abandoning their credit standards in an effort to follow the lead of Wall Street. If these explanations fail to convince, a third blames a combination of deregulation and insufficient regulation, again driven by greed, as rulemakers were asleep at their posts. What is missing is the central role played by an affordable housing policy built upon the misguided concept of loosened underwriting -- a policy created by Congress and implemented for 15 years by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and banking regulators. From 1993 onward, regulators worked with weakened lending policies as mandated by Congress. These policies systematically dismantled a housing-finance system based on the common sense principles of adequate down payments, good credit, and an ability to handle the mortgage debt. Substituted was a scam of liberalized lending standards that turned out to be no standards at all. In 1990, one in 200 home-purchase loans (all government insured) had a down payment of less than or equal to 3 percent. By 2003, one in seven home buyers had such a low down payment, and by 2006 about one in three put no money down. These policies led millions of Americans to buy homes with little or no money down, impaired credit and insufficient income. As a result, our economy has been brought down and the taxpayers have had to foot the bill for bailout after bailout. Congress and President Barack Obama's administration refuse to learn the lesson that is painfully aware to American taxpayers, and they have made it clear that they have no intention of fixing broken underwriting. The Dodd-Frank bill, signed in July 2010 by the president, omitted both an adequate down payment and a good credit history from the list of criteria indicating a lower risk of default as regulators sought to define a qualified residential mortgage. This was no oversight. Sen. Robert Corker, R-Tenn., and others proposed an amendment that would have added both a minimum down-payment requirement and consideration of credit history along with the establishment by regulators of a 'prudent underwriting' standard. This amendment was defeated. In early September 2010, Fannie and Freddie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, following requirements set out in 2008 by Congress, finalized affordable housing mandates that are likely to prove more risky than those that led to Fannie and Freddie's taxpayer bailout. As required by Congress, these new goals almost exclusively relate to very low- and low- income borrowers. Meeting these goals will necessitate a return to dangerous minimal down-payment lending, along with other imprudent lending standards. As a society, we have to go back to at least 20 percent down, with limited exceptions. Credit histories need to be solid. Documentation has to be iron- clad. Lender capital levels need to be raised. Here's my proposal to bring Congress's penchant for imprudent lending to a quick end: All congressional pension assets should be invested in funds backed solely by the high- risk loans mandated by federal housing legislation. I have a feeling that things would change fast. "
1,"For four months, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili traded letters trying to pin down a time and place for Iran to meet with a group of powerful countries concerned about its nuclear program. Late last week, they appeared to have settled on a start date: Dec. 5. But they have yet to agree on a venue, a length for the talks or the subject. Iran says it is willing to talk about everything but its uranium enrichment program. The other countries - the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany - want to talk mostly about the nuclear program. The difficulty in restarting the talks, which have been on hold for more than a year, doesn't bode well, analysts and diplomats say. The latest round of U.N. Security Council sanctions, which by all accounts have been more crippling than anticipated, was intended to force Tehran to begin negotiating seriously about its nuclear program. But Iranian officials, insisting that the program is for peaceful energy purposes, have given little indication they are interested in negotiating. U.S. officials say Iran's well-documented problems with its uranium enrichment program this year have greatly reduced concerns that Iran is on the brink of producing a nuclear weapon, giving extra time to strike a deal. Iran is enriching uranium with a Pakistani version of a half-century-old Dutch design, and 'the Iranians now have discovered that it's a very poor machine,' a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. 'It's prone to breaking down. They've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these things break down.' The enrichment program apparently plateaued at just under 4,000 active centrifuges, he added. 'They could install a lot more if they wanted to, but they've decided that this machine is a loser, so that's why they stopped,' he said, adding that the Iranians appear to have had little success with a more advanced design. Yet the rise of a Republican majority in the House of Representatives could bring new political pressure to bear on the administration, forcing it to harden its stance on Iran and making it more difficult to strike a deal. In the past week, senior GOP figures have been pushing tougher steps. Ilena Ros- Lehtinen, the incoming chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters that 'if the country with whom we are negotiating with and playing diplomatic niceties with gets the feeling that they can string us along and have no actions take place, I think that's to the detriment of the United States.' She warned against conveying a 'sense of weakness and a lack of resolve.' Although the Obama administration has publicly stressed its interest in negotiations, some administration officials and advisers say they think the president would use military force to set back Iran's nuclear program if it appeared it was on the verge of having weapons capability. Some analysts say they think the tough talk reduces chances of a successful negotiation. 'The stick side has been emphasized so much that it is hard for Iran to hear anything positive,' said Paul Pillar, national intelligence officer for Near East and South Asia from 2000 to 2005, who teaches at Georgetown University. He said military action would be 'an enormous blunder with huge consequences for the United States.' The coming talks will also be complicated by a failed agreement concerning a medical research reactor in Tehran, the centerpiece of the talks last year. At the time, the deal looked like creative diplomacy. Iranian negotiators had agreed in principle to transfer more than 2,600 pounds of low-enriched uranium out of the country so that Russia and France could convert it into the specialized fuel cells for the reactor. The United States would help improve safety at the reactor, which makes medical isotopes for cancer patients. But the deal fell apart as Iranian officials backed away, suggesting that U.S. crowing about its achievement had hurt Iranian pride. Iran renegotiated the deal with Turkey and Brazil, but that pact was rejected by the other powers. Now Iran has indicated that the only part of its nuclear program it is willing to discuss is the research reactor instead of the centrifuge facility at Natanz, which is the source of international concern. Moreover, Iran has begun enriching some uranium to 19.75 percent, bringing it a step closer to weapons-grade, because that is the level needed for the medical isotope facility. "
1,"Philippine police commandos killed an Abu Sayyaf commander linked to last year's kidnapping of Red Cross workers and gunned down two other militants in a clash in the south, officials said Sunday. Police went on full alert after the killings to guard against any retaliatory attacks. Gafur Jumdail and two of his men were killed late Saturday near Maimbung town on Jolo island after clashing with commandos tracking a Malaysian militant and allied Filipino fighters, Jolo police chief Senior Superintendent Joseph Ramac said. The death of Jumdail, who had been accused of several high-profile abductions including the January 2009 kidnappings of three Red Cross workers from Switzerland, Italy and the Philippines, is the latest blow to the al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf. Still, the group remains a major security threat in the Philippines, and national police placed the entire force in the southern Mindanao region on full alert Sunday to brace for any possible retaliatory attacks over Jumdail's death. In Saturday's clash, commandos assaulted a house in a remote village in an attempt to arrest Jumdail, his elder brother, who is also an Abu Sayyaf commander, and Zulkifli bin Hir, a Malaysian militant wanted by Washington for alleged terrorist involvement, according to a police report. As they raided the house, about 20 other Abu Sayyaf militants armed with rifles and grenade launchers opened fire nearby, sparking a 15-minute gunbattle. When the militants withdrew, police found the bodies of Gafur Jumdail and two other militants in the house, the report said. Washington has blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization and deployed hundreds of troops in the country's south to train and arm Filipino soldiers battling the militants. The extremist group, which has about 400 gunmen in Jolo and outlying islands, has been blamed for the country's worst bomb attacks, kidnapping sprees and for beheading some of its hostages, including an American tourist, who was decapitated in 2001. Zulkifli bin Hir, also known as Marwan, is a U.S.-trained engineer accused by Philippine authorities of involvement in a number of deadly bombings in the country. The U.S. has offered a $5 million reward for his capture. Marwan is believed to have been hiding with the Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippines for years. It was not immediately clear if Marwan was with Jumdail during Saturday's assault, police said. The U.S. State Department says Marwan is believed to be a leader of the militant organization Kumpulun Mujahidin Malaysia and a member of the central command of Jemaah Islamiyah, the al-Qaida affiliate blamed for numerous regional attacks, including the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings in Indonesia.

1,"Dominican Republic cyclist Leonardo Grullon has died after he and four other cyclists were hit by a truck while training for the Panamerican championships. The Dominican Cycling Federation says 24-year-old Grullon was struck when an unidentified truck driver apparently fell asleep and ran into the group in a mountainous community northwest of Santo Domingo. Grullon died on Thursday. Federation spokeswoman Ana Lebron says four of the five cyclists were members of the national team, including Juan Carlos Polanco, who is critically injured. The group expected to travel to Mexico for the championships starting on April 30. "
1,"American International Group Inc.'s former top executive Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg agreed Thursday to a $90 million settlement of lawsuits alleging he deceived investors while running the insurer, according to a court filing. The insurers that cover AIG's executives agreed to pay the money to resolve claims that Greenberg, the former chief executive officer, and other officials used accounting tricks and fraudulent schemes to disguise problems, according to the filing in Delaware Chancery Court. The money is being paid to AIG and not individual investors as part of the agreement. The settlement in the case, a so-called derivative suit filed by investors against executives and directors on behalf of the company, comes a month after AIG agreed to separately pay $725 million to investors who lost money amid the company's share decline. In 2008, AIG accepted a U.S. government bailout that has swelled to $182.3 billion. 'We are pleased this matter has been satisfactorily resolved,' Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, said in an e-mail. AIG said in November that it settled all legal disputes with Greenberg and would reimburse as much as $150 million in fees. Greenberg and the insurer agreed not to make disparaging statements about each other. Lee Wolosky, a lawyer for Greenberg, didn't immediately return call and e-mail seeking comment. Greenberg, 85, built AIG into the world's largest insurer over almost four decades until he was forced to retire in March 2005 amid state and federal probes into a reinsurance transaction. Lawsuits kept AIG and its former top executive in court since his departure. Former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued Greenberg in 2005, alleging he misled regulators and investors. Spitzer dropped portions of the suit in 2006 and Greenberg asked a court to dismiss the rest. The New York suit is unaffected by this settlement, Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, said in an interview. AIG restated earnings and agreed to pay $1.64 billion to settle claims by Spitzer and other regulators, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In court papers filed in July 2006, Greenberg argued AIG's 2005 restatement was unnecessary and designed to force him to retire. He denied any wrongdoing in the New York civil suit. --With assistance from Phil Milford and Dawn McCarty in Wilmington, Del. "
1,"A panel of federal advisers will soon wrestle with a question that has bedeviled poets, philosophers and generations of frustrated men: What do women want? That enigma will be part of a Food and Drug Administration committee's deliberations next month when it considers endorsing the first pill designed to do for women what Viagra did for men: boost their sex lives. A German pharmaceutical giant wants to sell a drug with the decidedly unsexy name 'flibanserin,' which has shown prowess for sparking a woman's sexual desire by fiddling with her brain chemicals. Even before the FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee meets June 18 to consider the request, the prospect of the drug's approval has triggered debate over whether the medication, like others in the pipeline, represents a long-sought step toward equity for women's health or the latest example of the pharmaceutical industry fabricating a questionable disorder to sell unnecessary _ and potentially dangerous _ drugs. 'Achieving a happy and healthy sex life can be a real and important problem for some women,' said Amy Allina of the National Women's Health Network, a Washington-based advocacy group. 'But we have lots of questions about the `pink Viagra.' ' Viagra's catapult to blockbuster status after its 1998 approval set off a flurry of interest in me-too medications for women. Drug maker Pfizer's hopes that its 'little blue pill' would also ignite female libido fizzled, however, making it clear that a woman's sexuality is more complicated than a man's. Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim is optimistic that flibanserin is on the verge of becoming the first prescription medication to tap what some have estimated could be $2 billion market in the United States alone. 'We believe women deserve options,' said Michael Sand, who heads the company's clinical research on flibanserin, 'and we're hoping flibanserin may represent a safe and effective option for many women.' Scientists found that flibanserin, developed as an antidepressant, was ineffective for treatment of depression. But the drug appeared to produce an unexpected side effect: boosting women's libido. That prompted the company to study it for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD, an otherwise unexplained loss of sexual thoughts, fantasies and desire that can cause significant emotional distress. Some research suggests 10 percent of women might suffer from HSDD. 'It's not that they are averse to sex. It's just that they don't care about it. They just stop thinking about it,' said Anita Clayton, a professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the University of Virginia who has studied the drug for the company. 'It's like a switch has been flipped. It's a loss for them. They miss it. And they want it back.' Lana, a housewife in Northern Virginia, said she feared her gradual, unexplained loss of sexual desire threatened her marriage. 'You kind of need to have it for closeness,' said Lana, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used. 'You've heard the saying, `Men are like microwave ovens, and women are like crock pots?' Well, I felt like I was a crock pot with a short circuit. I was supposed to be at a woman's peak, but I was fizzling.' So far, the company has sponsored studies involving more than 5,000 premenopausal women ages 18 to 50 in the United States, Canada and Europe in whom HSDD had been diagnosed. A 100-milligram daily dosage increased the number of satisfying sexual experiences from the number that women had reported from the previous month _ a key benchmark the FDA has set for such drugs _ from an average of 2.7 to 4.5, compared with 3.7 among those taking a placebo. Critics have ridiculed that difference as negligible. But Sand and other researchers say for many women, the difference is meaningful. 'What we know,' Sand said, 'is the overall experience of the increase in satisfying sexual activity, the increase in the amount of desire and the decrease in distress that goes along with that is, in women's voices, considered meaningful.' Exactly how the drug works is unclear, but it appears to decrease levels of one brain chemical, serotonin, while boosting levels of two others: dopamine and norepinephrine. Although some women experienced minor side effects such as nausea, dizziness and drowsiness, no serious complications have been reported, Sand said. Critics say that the pharmaceutical industry played a central role in defining HSDD as an official psychiatric disorder and exaggerated its scope by funding key research. 'People think they are sick when they are not. People become patients when they don't need to be,' said Ray Moynihan, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle in Australia and author of the forthcoming book, 'Sex, Lies, and Pharmaceuticals.' For many women, waning sexual desire is a normal part of aging. For others, it might be a sign of other medical problems, a dysfunctional relationship, or even an abusive partner. 'Is it really a problem, or is it the societal message of what they're supposed to be experiencing, or pressure from a partner, or changes in themselves?' asked Susan Bennett, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In weighing the potential risks and benefits of making flibanserin available by prescription, the FDA committee _ its members split evenly between men and women _ will have to navigate the subtle terrain of elusive emotional concepts such as desire, arousal, satisfaction and distress. 'Women's desire for sexual emancipation is very worthy,' said Leonore Tiefer, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. 'I fear that it's being hijacked by a profit-oriented industry that doesn't really try to understand women and their sexuality.' In addition to potential long-term side effects that will become clear only after many more women take the drug for many years _ as with hormone replacement therapy _ some people fear flibanserin could make women vulnerable to abuse. 'Is this going to make women desire an abusive partner? asked Liz Canner, a documentary filmmaker who produced Orgasm Inc. about the pharmaceutical industry's role in developing drugs for female sexual disorders. 'Is it going to make us desire every guy who walks by?' Sand disputed that concern. 'This isn't some kind of aphrodisiac that we can put in the water and have suddenly sexually interested women in our population,' Sand said. 'The notion that somehow this is a construct of the pharmaceutical industry is misleading. This isn't something new. This is something women have been suffering for a long time.' "
1,"At some recent point, bacon became a meme. (ital) Bacon. (end ital) The cured pork product that has been a staple food for hundreds of years was suddenly a fashion accessory for Internet style-mongers. There were odes and T-shirts and cartoons. People taped bacon to their cats and took photos. It was so ubiquitous that I started to hate bacon. No one should ever have to hate bacon. What used to be an amusing byproduct of Internet use has mutated into something horrible: an insatiable parasite that impairs its host's judgment, rendering it totally useless. Instead of acting as an organic cultural touchstone, the modern meme _ from LOL, which hasn't been used to signify physical laughter since 1997, to Lolcats _ now sucks the joy out of our interconnectedness. It destroys uniqueness. Once an 'enjoyable thing' becomes a 'meme,' we stop enjoying the thing for its own sake, but consume and regurgitate our enjoyment of it as a symbol of hipness, as if to say: 'I am aware of this thing's popularity _ therefore I, too, exist!' But the short life span of the average meme means it can't imprint itself on the human psyche in any real way. We want instant nostalgia, and what we get is manufactured zeitgeist. The faster memes spread, the more homogenized online conversation becomes, until a few phrases dominate the discourse. (And if you've never had the unfortunate occasion to hear someone, forgetting that life is not a message board, yell 'FAIL!' aloud, you are missing out on an exquisite kind of existential rage.) Life on the Internet moves too fast. There's no time to let experience meet friction, or to absorb and truly reconstitute information. So slow down, breathe, and appreciate what's real in life. _ Randazzo is the editor of the Onion and the founder of the Joe Randazzo Association. "

1,"Zimbabwe's neighbors will hold a summit this week to try to break an impasse that threatens the southern African nation's unity government, a spokesman for Zimbabwe's prime minister said Monday. President Robert Mugabe, accused by the premier of undermining the coalition, indicated he would be at the summit to give his side. Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said a summit is necessary because of the gravity of the situation. Tsvangirai announced his boycott of the unity government on Oct. 16, citing a surge in political violence and accusing longtime ruler Mugabe of treating him like a junior partner, or worse. Tsvangirai's spokesman James Maridadi said Tsvangirai learned Monday that the leaders of Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia will meet Thursday in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, to discuss the crisis. Mugabe, speaking to reporters Monday, did not refer directly to the summit, but said: 'We are ready to brief the regional leaders on the problems we are facing.' Mugabe spoke after meeting for nearly four hours with his Congolese counterpart, President Joseph Kabila, who was in Zimbabwe in his capacity as chairman of the Southern African Development Community. The leaders of Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia, who will be holding Thursday's summit, are key members of the bloc, which pushed for Zimbabwe's power-sharing agreement after a series of inconclusive elections marred by violence blamed on Mugabe's supporters. Kabila was to meet with Tsvangirai late Monday or Tuesday. Kabila told reporters after his meeting with Mugabe that he wanted 'to find the way forward.' Mugabe said he expected Kabila to tell Tesvangirai that he chose to join the coalition 'and must be able to face the problems and not to run away from them.' -------- Associated Press Writer Chengetai Zvauya in Harare, Zimbabwe contributed to this report.

1,"Argentina praised the U.S. House on Friday for passing a measure that would force American intelligence agencies to share their files on dictatorship-era human rights violations in this country. If approved by the U.S. Senate and President Barack Obama, the measure could provide key evidence for human rights trials under way in Argentina and possibly help some 400 families find children who were stolen at birth from women who were kidnapped and killed by the dictatorship, according to Argentina's ambassador to the U.S., Hector Timerman. 'The affirmative vote of the (House of) Representatives is an important gesture of solidarity with all victims of the dictatorship in Argentina and also a strong demonstration of a commitment to defend human rights by the American people and the institutions that represent them,' Timerman said in a statement. The measure was sponsored by U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey, whose similar effort involving U.S. files on Chile eventually revealed a trove of information that showed how deeply involved the Central Intelligence Agency was in destabilizing the government of socialist President Salvador Allende there before the 1973 coup. The measure is supported by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit group in Washington seeking to sue the Freedom of Information Act to reveal government secrets. The archive has filed some 200 FOIA requests to intelligence agencies for information on Argentina, with less than a dozen positive responses, said Carlos Osorio, a researcher with the group. 'It was the duty of the CIA to keep on top of what this dictatorship was doing in the 1970s and 1980s,' Osorio said. 'All this is relevant information, and it's exactly what the Argentine judges want.' "
1,"The oil leak spreading 5,000 barrels of crude a day in the Gulf of Mexico is reshaping the politics of the energy debate as Congress considers climate policy and lawmakers brace for the November elections. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, withdrew his support for offshore oil drilling Tuesday, following a similar move by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who raised doubts about environmental safety. One official who said the drilling should continue is former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee. In 2008, Republicans made expanded offshore oil and gas exploration central to their presidential campaign platform, punctuated by chants of 'drill, baby, drill.' 'This is a really major setback both for climate and, of course, also on energy policy,' Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview Monday. 'Everything now is obviously on hold.' The leak began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, an offshore drilling rig owned by Transocean and leased by London-based BP. The rig sank two days later and the oil has spread to within five to 10 miles of the Louisiana coast, threatening the region's fishermen, shrimpers and oystermen. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward met with Obama administration officials Monday to discuss how to manage the spill. Hayward and BP America Chairman Lamar McKay had talks with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, said a White House statement. The government officials requested an update on 'how BP plans to ensure an effective response' in affected Gulf Coast states, according to the statement. 'It was a very constructive dialogue,' Hayward told reporters afterward. Hayward claimed responsibility for the disaster on behalf of BP during an interview Monday on NBC's 'Today' program and vowed to clean up the spill in tandem with the government. Engineers are working to cap the leak. At least three committees -- House Energy and Commerce, House Natural Resources, and Senate Energy and Natural Resources -- plan hearings to investigate the spill during the next month. Obama on March 31 agreed to open new sections of the Atlantic coastline and the eastern Gulf of Mexico to new underwater drilling. Administration officials hoped the move would help win Republican support for a climate bill that has languished in the Senate since passing the House of Representatives last June. The spill now threatens any deal. 'It could have as big an impact as Santa Barbara,' said Philip Verleger, an oil industry expert, referring to the 1969 oil spill off the California coast that reshaped the country's environmental policy and was the catalyst for the first Earth Day in 1970. 'This is a big setback,' he said. The Gulf of Mexico leak solidifies a division in the Senate between Republicans and Democrats on one side who favor more domestic oil and gas exploration, and Democrats who don't. 'To get my vote, any energy or climate bill must prohibit drilling in places where a spill could reach New Jersey's waters,' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. In one respect, 'it really hastens the debate' over an energy bill,' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. On the other hand, the safety of offshore drilling now becomes paramount, he said. 'It's a hard case to make until you get down to the safety issues,' Durbin said. Durbin said he expects the administration to offer new safety standards for offshore drilling. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been working with Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass. and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., on a bipartisan compromise, cautioned against making too much of the spill. 'We've had problems with car design, but you don't stop driving,' Graham said in Greenville, S.C., on April 30, according to the Greenville News. 'The biggest beneficiaries of this proposal to stop drilling would be overseas oil interests, OPEC and regions that don't like us very much.' Crist, a longtime Republican running for the U.S. Senate as an independent, withdrew his support for offshore drilling during a May 2 interview on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' Palin said the spill shouldn't deter drilling. On her Facebook page Monday, she expressed sympathy over the accident, while saying she still believes in the slogan 'drill here, drill now.'

1,"Oprah promised on Monday that the kickoff of her last season as Queen of Daytime would include 'two of the most heart-pounding, head-spinning surprises of all time.' No, she did <I>not </I> announce that cable TV's Oprah Winfrey Network co-venture with Discovery was all just a bad dream and that she would not be quitting her talk show after all at the end of this, its 25th season, to focus on that new network and would instead continue her reign over the daytime kingdom. Instead, Oprah announced, on The First Episode of Her Final Season, that she would take the entire, 300-strong, studio audience of carefully picked 'Oprah' superfans to Sydney for an eight-day visit in December. Did she make this confetti-dropping announcement to make sure she gets a warm studio welcome when she tapes a couple of episodes Down Under for this, her last season, before turning all her attention to her cable network co-venture with Discovery? We're also not sure about the other heart-pounding, head-spinning surprise. It might have been John Travolta coming out onstage at the top of the show, which had the Oprah Uber Fans on their feet, screaming and gasping and clasping their hands to their mouths and chests. Travolta, Oprah explained, was voted the show's all-time favorite guest _ he has put in 11 appearances over the years. 'If I may be so bold as to speak for the public, speak for the world, Oprah, there's only one of you and there will never be another,' Travolta gushed. 'Oh, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!' Oprah emoted. (Travolta, Oprah told her audience, is a pilot with Qantas, which is among the sponsors footing the bill for the Sydney trip.) The other surprise might have been the six fans from Boston who were sent by Oprah's BFF Gayle King on a road trip to Chicago to attend the season debut, but were 'tricked' into driving right onto the stage after being told the debut would happen the next day. 'This isn't what I was going to wear!' wailed one of the Boston Oprah diehards. We're pretty sure it wasn't Don Johnson's walk-on, which allegedly came as a surprise to Oprah, while she was reminding her fans how she failed to land the now-semi-washed-up, then-very-hot 'Miami Vice' star as a guest on the first episode of her show. 'No, they didn't! No, they, no, no, no, no! Didn't! No, they didn't!' Oprah screeched about her staff pulling a fast one. 'Oh, no! No! No!' she added for good measure. And if it reminded Johnson how far he'd fallen relative to how far she'd climbed, so much the better. On the other hand, the second surprise might have been what Oprah's staff had prepared for Monday's Very Last Season Debut, in which Paul Simon came out onstage to play an updated version of a song that, the audience was told, he wrote for Oprah 15 years ago for her 10th anniversary show. It was definitely a heart-pounding, head-spinning surprise to us that Simon was in a place, 15 years ago, in which he thought writing ditties for Oprah's syndicated talk show was a good career move. Oprah wept as Simon sang to her: If you look into your future life, decades from this question, do you imagine a familiar light burning in the distance, the love that never dies? Twenty five years have come and gone, and that story's still unfolding, suitcase packed, you're moving on, with the memories you're holding, and you'll be home when you arrive. _ _ _ About 11.4 million people tuned in to the 'Video Music Awards' on Sunday night in hopes of seeing Kanye West and Taylor Swift kiss and make up. Seriously. And that makes it the third biggest audience in MTV history. Instead of locking lips, however, Kanye and Taylor exchanged tunes about each other and <I>zzzzzzzzzz</I> .. In his Ode to Taylor but Not Really, Kanye both flogged and praised himself for his behavior at the 2009 trophy show. Last year, you'll remember, when Swift won the VMA for best female video, Kanye cut off the teen singer, grabbing the microphone from her and protesting that Beyonc should have won. And a new phrase was born: 'She got Kanye'd.' 'You've been putting up with my (expletive) way too long,' Kanye rapped one year later, according to The Washington Post. Then, the refrain: 'Let's have a toast for the (expletive)!' Bet you're sorry you missed the show now! When Swift got her turn at bat on Sunday, she sang drearily, referring to Kanye, '32 is still growing up.' Oh, snap! Oh, and Lady Gaga, who at one point was wearing a 'meat' outfit that had PETA's cami-knickers in a bunch, took home a record eight VMAs, including Video of the Year, Best Pop Video and Best Female Video. And Justin Bieber and His Hair won the viewers' choice for Best New Artist. Sunday's VMAs were not the most watched in the show's history. In 2002, 11.9 million viewers watched as Britney Spears introduced Michael Jackson, by way of presenting him with a birthday cake, only in her intro she said he was the Artist of the Millennium and Jackson proceeded to give an acceptance speech for being named Artist of the Millennium. "
1,"The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Sunday that parliament's rejection of most of President Hamid Karzai's nominees for a new Cabinet will delay efforts to establish a functioning government that can focus on badly needed reforms. Kai Eide said he was surprised that lawmakers rejected 17 of Karzai's 24 picks. Karzai will now have to spend time submitting new Cabinet nominees, delaying his second-term government's ability to fully partner with donor nations ahead of an international conference on Afghanistan in London on Jan. 28, he said. In 10 hours of voting Saturday, parliament rejected nominees viewed as Karzai's political cronies, those believed to be under the influence of warlords and others deemed unqualified. The vote was a setback to the president, although lawmakers did approve his retention of incumbents in the key portfolios of defense, interior and finance. 'I think most of us were surprised at how many ministers were not approved by the parliament,' Eide said. 'It's a setback and it's a distraction.' Karzai spokesman Waheed Omar said Sunday that the president also was surprised by the rejections, but the vote showed Afghanistan has a pluralistic political system. 'This is the beauty of democracy. We are exercising democracy,' Omar told reporters. He acknowledged that 'this is obviously not good in terms of the functioning of the government, in terms of services,' but said all ministries were still functioning. 'In some ministries the deputies are carrying out the duties,' Omar said. Abdullah Abdullah, the former foreign minister who ran against Karzai in last August's fraud-ridden presidential election, said he believed the rejection of the Cabinet nominees could have reverberations in this month's international conference. 'I think it will affect the situation in the London conference, first of all (because) the legitimacy of Mr. Karzai was under question because of what happened in the elections and afterwards,' he told Associated Press Television News. Karzai will submit new nominations for the empty ministerial posts, Omar said, but it was not clear when. 'It could take weeks,' Eide predicted. 'It could take more than weeks before we have a government shaped and approved by parliament.' Eide, a Norwegian diplomat, is stepping down this year after a rocky two-year tenure marked by a fraud-marred national election and a deadly Taliban attack on U.N. employees. He spoke to reporters just hours before leaving the country to speak Wednesday at the U.N. Security Council. He said he would express his concern that the deployment of 37,000 more foreign troops to Afghanistan would increase military involvement in political, civilian and humanitarian affairs at precisely the time in the 8-year-old war when it is critical to strengthen political and civilian institutions. 'We need a sustained, long-term build up of the civilian institutions and the Afghan economy,' he said. 'That is a concern I have and I will express that as strongly as I can at the Security Council.' Eide also called for electoral reforms to be in place before upcoming parliamentary elections are held. Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission has said it plans to hold the elections as scheduled on May 22 despite international concerns that another ballot now without reforms would amount to a repeat of last August's presidential election. Eide noted a provision in Afghan law permits the elections to be postponed for a few months. 'For me, and I think for the international community as such, it is important that a real reform process takes place before the next elections happen,' Eide said. Ali Najafi, head of the election commission, said last week that Afghanistan needs about $50 million from the international community to meet the election's estimated budget of $120 million. Eide said there have been preliminary discussions, but the Afghan government has not made any formal request for money or assistance. Also Sunday, the Kunduz provincial governor's spokesman, Mahbobullah Sayedi, said 21 Taliban fighters were killed in fighting Saturday with Afghan and foreign forces. There were no casualties among the joint force or civilians, he said. ------ Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Kabul contributed to this report. "
1,"President Barack Obama said Tuesday that if any laws were broken in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, people will be prosecuted. He dispatched his attorney general to the Gulf and gave marching orders to the leaders of an independent commission investigating the spill 'to follow the facts wherever they lead, without fear or favor.' Obama spoke in the White House's Rose Garden after meeting with the co-chairmen of the commission, Bob Graham, a former Florida governor and Democratic U.S. senator, and William K. Reilly, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency under Republican President George H.W. Bush. Their task, Obama said: 'To thoroughly examine the spill and its causes, so that we never face such a catastrophe again.' Port Fouchon, Louisiana, Attorney General Eric Holder said federal authorities had begun criminal and civil investigations into the leakage of millions of gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Holder met with the attorneys general of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi and several U.S. attorneys. He said several senators have asked the Justice Department to determine whether criminal or civil laws were broken in the spill. The Justice Department has told Sen. Barbara Boxer, who heads the Senate's environment committee, that it has ordered BP PLC, lessor of the destroyed oil rig, not to destroy documents that could be relevant to investigators. 'If our laws were broken, leading to this death and destruction, my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region,' Obama said. He said that if existing laws were insufficient to prevent another such catastrophe, the laws would be changed, and if oversight were inadequate, it would have to be reformed. Obama's session with Graham and Reilly and Holder's visit to the Gulf Coast come three days after BP said its latest attempt to stop the oil spewing out of a broken well under 5,000 feet of water had failed. That latest setback happened not long after Obama held a rare White House news conference devoted mainly to the spill and visited coastal Louisiana to assess the situation and reassure frustrated residents. The administration moved on several fronts Tuesday to assert more control over the catastrophe and distance itself from well operator BP. Administration officials walked a fine line, however, to avoid the harshest criticism of a company it still must rely on to tame the runaway oil well. Also, by claiming more responsibility they opened themselves to more political exposure should the situation in the Gulf continue to deteriorate. The administration put an end to joint news conferences with Coast Guard and BP officials that had been occurring in the gulf. Instead, the federal leader of the response effort, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, will conduct his own briefings. In some of the administration's most direct criticism of BP since the drilling rig it was leasing off the Gulf exploded April 20, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the oil giant was not forthcoming about the risks involved in the latest tactic for reining in the spill, which has poured at least 20 million gallons of crude into the Gulf. BP is moving forward with plans, approved by the Obama administration, to slice through the damaged riser that is billowing oil and gas and cap it with a containment mechanism. White House Energy Adviser Carol Browner said during the weekend that the approach could result in a temporary 20 percent increase in the flow, a figure Gibbs repeated Tuesday. BP has said it did not expect a significant increase in flow from the cutting and capping plan. 'Do I think that BP was forthcoming on what the impact would be of cutting the riser off? No, obviously,' Gibbs said. But he did not respond directly when asked whether Obama trusts BP. 'We will continue to push BP to do whatever we feel is necessary to respond to the leak,' Gibbs said. Over the weekend Obama said the continued leak 'is as enraging as it is heartbreaking.' Obama seemed more calm than enraged Tuesday but Gibbs assured reporters the rage was there, though he demurred when asked if BP was its target. 'I've seen rage from him. I have,' Gibbs said, describing Obama appearing in meetings with 'clenched jaw' and ordering aides to 'plug the damn hole.' Tuesday's meeting was Obama's first with the independent commission's co-chairmen since he selected them less than two weeks ago. He directed them to report back in six months. Obama still must name five members of the commission, which will investigate such issues as what caused the spill, the safety of offshore drilling and operations at the federal agency that grants drilling rights. Browner said she does not want to guess the prospects for success from the containment cap approach. Interviewed Tuesday on ABC's 'Good Morning America,' the White House energy and global warming adviser said, 'everyone, I think, is hoping for the best, but we continue to plan for the worst.' She said she is concerned about the impact the coming hurricane season could have on ending the environmental crisis. "
1,"Iranian security forces on Sunday killed at least four people, including a nephew of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, during the fiercest clashes with anti-government protesters in months, opposition Web sites and witnesses said. Amateur video footage purportedly from the center of Tehran showed an enraged crowd carrying away one of the casualties, chanting, 'I'll kill, I'll kill the one who killed my brother.' In several locations in the center of the capital, demonstrators fought back furiously against security forces, hurling stones and setting their motorcycles, cars and vans ablaze, according to video footage and pro-reform Web sites. Demonstrations also took place in at least three other cities. A close aide to Mousavi, a presidential contender in a disputed June election, said the 35-year-old nephew, Ali Mousavi, died of injuries in a Tehran hospital. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of reprisals from the government. Mousavi's Web site and another reformist Web site, Parlemannews.ir, also said Ali Mousavi died during clashes in which security forces reportedly fired on demonstrators. The protesters in Tehran tried to cut off roads with burning barricades that filled the sky with billowing black smoke. One police officer was photographed with blood streaming down his face after he was set upon by the crowd in a blazing street. The protests began with thousands of opposition supporters chanting 'Death to the dictator,' a reference to hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as they took to the streets in defiance of official warnings of a harsh crackdown on any demonstrations coinciding with a religious observance on Sunday. Iranians were marking Ashoura, commemorating the seventh-century death in battle of one of Shiite Islam's most beloved saints. Security forces tried but failed to disperse protesters on a central Tehran street with tear gas, charges by baton-wielding officers and warning shots fired into the air. They then opened fire directly at protesters, killing at least three people, said witnesses and the pro-reform Web site Rah-e-Sabz. A fourth protester was shot dead on a nearby street, they said. Witnesses said one victim was an elderly man who had a gunshot wound to the forehead. He was seen being carried away by opposition supporters with blood covering his face. More than two dozen opposition supporters were injured, some of them seriously, with limbs broken from beatings, according to witnesses. There were also violent confrontations in at least three other major cities: Isfahan and Najafabad in central Iran and Shiraz in the south. The clashes marked the bloodiest confrontation between protesters and security forces since the height of the unrest in the weeks after June's election. The opposition says Ahmadinejad won the election through massive vote fraud and that Mousavi was the true winner. Reporters from foreign media organizations were barred from covering the demonstrations on Tehran's central Enghelab Street, or Revolution Street, and the reports of deaths could not be independently confirmed. Video footage circulating on the Web could also not be authenticated. Ambulance sirens could be heard near the site of the protests. The witnesses and opposition Web sites said angry protesters threw stones at security forces and set dozens of their motorbikes on fire. Police helicopters circled overhead as clouds of black smoke billowed into the sky over the capital. Tehran's police chief denied officers fired on the crowd -- or that they were even armed. 'No report of death has been sent to the police,' Azizollah Rajabzadeh said, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency. 'No one has been killed. Police did not open fire and the present officers did not carry weapons.' Police had blocked streets leading to the center of the capital to try to prevent thousands of people from joining the protest. Still, many opposition supporters managed to break the security wall. Fierce clashes also broke out Sunday between security forces and opposition supporters in the cities of Isfahan and Najafabad in central Iran, the Rah-e-Sabz Web site said. Cell phone services were down and Internet connections were slowed to a crawl, as has happened during most other days of opposition protest in an apparent government attempt to limit publicity and prevent protesters from organizing. Opposition activists have held a series of anti-government protests since the death of a dissident cleric last week. The Dec. 20 death of the 87-year-old Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, a sharp critic of Iran's leaders, has given a new push to opposition protests, which have endured despite a heavy security crackdown since the election. His memorials have brought out not only the young, urban activists who filled the ranks of earlier protests, but also older, more religious Iranians who revered Montazeri on grounds of faith as much as politics. Tens of thousands marched in his funeral procession in the holy city of Qom on Monday, many chanting slogans against the government. Iran's police chief, Gen. Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam, had threatened tougher action against protesters on Sunday should they hold rallies. Opposition leaders have used holidays and other symbolic days in recent months to stage anti-government rallies. Iran is under pressure both from its domestic opposition within the country and from the United States and its European allies, which are pushing Iran to suspend key parts of its nuclear program. "
1,"Apple's new-product launches tend to suck the oxygen from anyone else who dares unveil a gadget around the same time. Such is the fate of the Droid X, the sequel to the phone that launched Motorola's comeback effort last year. The Droid X, which Verizon Wireless and Motorola introduced the same week as the iPhone 4 and goes on sale July 15, probably hasn't received as much attention as it should. While it lacks the iPhone's polish and buzz, it's definitely worth a look if you find yourself repelled rather than attracted by Apple's gravitational-distortion field. And as long as you have a big enough place to stash it. The Droid X is huge -- one of the largest smartphones I've ever used. Its 4.3-inch screen is 16 percent larger than the original Droid, known outside the United States as the Motorola Milestone, which was itself a hefty chunk of hardware. It's 23 percent bigger than the 3.5-inch display on the iPhone. Yet for all its girth, the Droid X is both thinner and lighter than its predecessor and not at all uncomfortable to hold, at least if your hand is large enough. Mine is, and I found a natural place for my index finger to grasp it, just where the rear of the case flares out to accommodate the 8-megapixel, dual- flash camera. Motorola accomplished the reductions in weight and thickness by jettisoning the original Droid's slide-out physical keyboard in favor of an onscreen one that, especially when in landscape mode, is a pleasure to use thanks to all that display real estate. Like all Motorola smartphones, the Droid X runs Google's Android operating system; the former king of wireless, which saw its fortunes tumble when it wasn't able to come up with a successor to its smash-hit Razr line, scrapped its own operating-system development efforts a year or two ago. Android continues to improve in terms of usability and the number of applications available -- now a claimed 70,000. And the Droid X can do some cool things the iPhone can't. One is to act as a Wi-Fi signal for nearby laptop computers or other devices. The Mobile Hotspot feature costs an extra $20 for up to 2 gigabytes of data per month; that's on top of the cost of the phone itself -- $199 after a $100 rebate -- plus a voice plan and $29.99 for unlimited data. The Droid X also makes use of Motorola's MotoBlur software, which lets you combine content from Facebook, Twitter and other social-networking sites into a single stream. It's a handy feature, much less obtrusive here than it is on Motorola's Cliq phone, whose users seem split between loving it and loathing it. The Droid X has a couple of advantages over the iPhone 4. It comes with 24 gigabytes of storage -- the comparably priced iPhone has 16 -- and you can expand the capacity to 40 gigabytes, where the more expensive iPhone 4 tops out at 32. The Droid also has a removable battery; a spare will come in particularly handy if you make much use of the power-sucking Mobile Hotspot. Perhaps the Droid X's biggest advantage over the iPhone is that it runs on Verizon Wireless, which enjoys a higher reputation than the AT&T network the iPhone is, for now at least, tethered to. Still, the iPhone 4 benefits from a larger universe of software -- Apple now claims more than 250,000 apps -- a sharper screen and a front-facing camera that allows for video calling over Wi- Fi. And it remains the smartphone gold standard for user-friendliness. "
1,"The Air Force mistakenly gave rival companies sensitive information that contained each other's confidential bids in a long-standing, multibillion dollar competition to build a new refueling tanker. Chicago-based Boeing Co., and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), parent of Airbus, are in an intense competition for a $35 billion contract to build 179 new Air Force tankers based either on the Boeing 767 jetliner or the Airbus A330. Boeing received detailed proprietary information about the EADS bid; corresponding information was given to EADS North America concerning the Boeing bid. 'It was a clerical error and involved a limited amount of source selection information,' Air Force spokesman Col. Les Kodlick said late Friday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Kodlick declined to be more specific about what data had been transmitted. Source selection information is data critical to the Air Force's making a decision on which bid to select and could include technical data about the competing aircraft as well as financial information. The Seattle Times, which first reported Friday on the Air Force's mistake, said the data included crucial pricing information on the competing bids. Kodlick said the incident 'will not delay' the awarding of the contract which had been expected before year's end, but recently had been postponed until early next year. Kodlick said the postponement was not related to the disclosure of proprietary data. It was not clear what use -- if any -- the two companies made of the information they received, reportedly on a computer disk. 'As soon as it happened and they received (the information) they recognized the errors and contacted the Air Force contracting officers,' said Kodlick. He said the Air Force has taken steps 'to make sure both companies have access to the same information.' But if the information included price data, it could have an impact on each companies' final bid proposal. Pricing has been a key issue in the competition. Last summer, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney expressed concern in a meeting with securities analysts that his company might be underbid by its European competitor. The Air Force is reviewing how the disclosures occurred and was 'taking steps that it doesn't happen again,' said Kodlick. Sen. Maria Cantwell, who was briefed Friday on the incident, said it was 'an inexcusable mishandling by the Air Force of very sensitive, proprietary data.' Sen. Patty Murray said in a statement she is 'deeply concerned by the Air Force's mishandling of proprietary information' about the tanker bids. 'This is a critical contract with serious consequences for our military and economy, and this mistake will further delay an award that has already been pushed back to allow an illegally subsidized company to compete,' said Murray. Boeing did not immediately return AP calls for comment. The Air Force needs to replace its KC-135 refueling tankers, which date to the 1950s. It has been trying to pick someone to make the new tanker since 2003. While the initial contract award was expected to be $35 billion, replacing the entire fleet of old tankers could be worth up to $100 billion. The competition had been intense between Boeing, the premier U.S. aircraft manufacturer, and EADS, the heavily subsidized European aircraft consortium. The Pentagon had hoped to award the contract by last August after having extended the bidding deadline so that EADS could submit its revised bid. The deadline was extended to fall and now is expected early next year. ------ Online: Boeing tanker: http://www.unitedstatestanker.com/ EADS tanker: http://www.kc45now.com/index/ "
1,"The United Nations climate chief on Friday challenged executives of multinational corporations including Coca-Cola and Unilever to play a more serious role in the global fight against climate change. Yvo de Boer told a meeting of corporate CEOs that the international climate change discussion was currently carried out between governments, with little involvement from the business world. 'Basically you are not playing any role in a serious way,' de Boer said. 'This is an intergovernmental process and many would like to keep it that way.' He said the challenge for corporate leaders was to 'make yourself relevant' to what happens at the U.N. climate conference, where negotiators from 192 countries are hammering out the details of a global warming pact. 'I think you are doing a great job at national level but you are not making any connections at the international level,' de Boer said. The chief executives at the Copenhagen Business Day meeting in downtown Copenhagen included Coca-Cola's Muhtar Kent, Paul Polman of Unilever and Gerard Mestrallet of Alstom Power. Many of the participants said they realized that they must change the way they do business as the world moves toward a low-carbon economy. 'Markets and consumers ask you to come with new solutions,' said Bruno Lafont, chief executive of Lafarge SA, the world's largest cement maker. 'Time is now,' said Ditlev Engel, CEO of wind turbine maker Vestas. 'It's now we have to change our businesses to become sustainable. The only question is at what speed we can do it.' In a panel discussion, Malini Mehra, head of the Center for Social Markets, which specializes in corporate responsibility, sustainability and climate change, urged the 21 executives to 'get out there to your governments and shout. And get the NGOs on your side,' she said. Mehra noted that the developing world was not present at the business conference. 'Not one single Indian CEO is here, and do you know why? Because they do not consider Copenhagen to be the most important event in 100 years,' she said. 'Go across and make friends with CEOs in developing countries.' "
1,"River Plate midfielder Diego Buonanotte has undergone surgery on a broken right arm, an injury that occurred when a car he was driving on Dec. 26 crashed, killing the three other people in the vehicle. Doctors at Los Arcos hospital in Buenos Aires said the 21-year-old Buonanotte, considered River Plate's player, had responded well to Wednesday's surgery but it was expected to take 48 hours to give him the all clear. He is likely to be sidelined for seven months. Buonanotte has been hospitalized since the accident. He also had a broken collarbone and chest injuries. "
1,"Lawmakers were on the brink Tuesday of exempting the nation's 18,000 auto dealers from oversight by a new consumer financial watchdog aimed at protecting borrowers from abusive lenders. Depending on the final language, the move could mark a major victory for industry lobbyists and a blow to President Barack Obama, Democratic leaders, consumer advocates and Pentagon officials, who have long opposed such a loophole. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House-Senate Conference Committee finalizing details of new financial regulations, reiterated his opposition to the auto-dealer exemption but proposed including it in the final bill, acknowledging the widespread support for it in the House last fall. 'I consider myself bound by the House,' he said. Although Senate negotiators largely agreed on the carve-out later in the day, the issue wasn't entirely settled. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who also opposed the exemption but acknowledged that the Senate had overwhelmingly passed a nonbinding directive in favor of excluding auto dealers, offered a compromise that could still subject dealers to the new watchdog's rules. Under Dodd's proposal, auto dealers would technically be exempt from the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. However, the bureau would have the power to write new truth-in-lending rules that could apply to auto dealers. The Federal Reserve could ignore those rules, but would have to explain its rationale. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to adopt aggressive new rules governing dealer-assisted financing. 'It's an effort to strike a bargain, a compromise here,' Dodd said. House negotiators had yet to agree to it Tuesday evening. Final details remained unsettled, though it seemed nearly certain that auto dealers would escape direct supervision by the new consumer bureau. Firms that provide direct auto financing such as GMAC, however, would still fall under its watch. Despite the apparent setback on the auto-dealer exemption, the Obama administration and consumer advocates secured a victory Tuesday that once looked uncertain. House and Senate negotiators solidified the shape of the new consumer protection regulator, which has long been a cornerstone of the administration's proposed financial overhaul. The new watchdog will operate as a bureau within the Federal Reserve, rather than as a standalone agency. But it will retain almost total autonomy, including independent funding, a presidentially appointed head and broad authority to write and enforce rules. On Tuesday, auto dealers were happy with the prospect of escaping regulation but remained wary of the Senate proposal. 'We've definitely made strides forward in the process, but the fight is far from over,' said Bailey Wood, spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association. For months, auto dealers have lobbied fervently to escape the consumer watchdog's reach, saying existing regulators have power to crack down on abusive practices and arguing repeatedly that they did not cause the financial crisis. Other groups, from payday lenders to pawnbrokers, made similar pitches but gained little traction. The difference appears to be one of sheer lobbying muscle and political clout: Auto dealers have one of the most deep-pocketed political action committees in Washington and, like community bankers, are often influential players in congressional districts across the country. Consumer advocates continued to hope for a compromise on the auto dealer carve- out. 'There's no good reason to have one set of rules for auto dealers that make car loans and another set of rules for community banks that make the same kind of loans. We don't regulate child car seats differently depending on who manufactures them, and we shouldn't regulate auto loans differently depending on who issues them,' Elizabeth Warren, chairman of the Congressional Oversight Panel and a key architect of the new consumer regulator, said in a statement. "
1,"The Pentagon, which is processing bids on a new contract to provide more than $100 million worth of jet fuel each year to a key U.S. air base in Kyrgyzstan, will open bidding next month on an equally lucrative contract to deliver fuel to Bagram air base in Afghanistan, officials said this week. Both Bagram and Manas air base in Kyrgyzstan are critical to the Afghanistan war effort, and both illustrate the logistics problems associated with fighting in that landlocked country. The proposed Bagram contract stipulates that the jet and diesel fuel to be supplied must be brought in via northern supply routes, like the fuel that goes to Manas. Though much of Bagram's fuel will still be trucked in from the south, the intent is to reduce dependence on that hazardous route, which is frequently the target of militant attacks. The northern routes, while safer, are far more circuitous, requiring fuel to be carried from refineries in Russia, Azerbaijan, Greece and other countries over and around the Caspian and Black seas and then overland to Bagram and Manas. The current contract for delivery of jet fuel to Bagram from the north has been held by Red Star Enterprises since 2007. The Manas supply has been handled since 2005 by Mina. The ownership of the two corporations has not been publicly disclosed, although they share offices in Gibraltar and London, as well as an operations director, Charles Squires, a former U.S. military attache in the Kyrgyz capital. The Manas contract has become controversial in strife-torn Kyrgyzstan, where the past two presidents have been overthrown in part because of allegations of family corruption related to fuel deliveries to the U.S. base. Recently, the new Kyrgyz government announced plans to create a national fuel company, stirring speculation that it wants to supply the base directly. Negotiations are under way between the Kyrgyz government and State Department officials and military officers from the base, according to government sources. As for the Bagram contract, Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a press officer at the Pentagon, said the new solicitation will be 'issued on a full and open competitive basis.' The current contract was associated with an unusual agreement that Red Star would build, own and operate a pipeline from storage fields it had established near the base to the base's perimeter, eliminating the need for its fuel trucks to enter the facility. Other potential bidders for the Bagram contract have complained that Red Star's pipeline gives it an advantage. But Robbins said in her statement Thursday that 'it is not our intent to eliminate either the pipeline or truck deliveries of northern-sourced product.' "
